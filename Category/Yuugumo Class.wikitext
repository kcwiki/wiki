The Yūgumo-class destroyer (夕雲型駆逐艦), also called Destroyer Type-A by the IJN, were similar to the preceding Kagerō-class with the only difference being a slightly different bridge design and the introduction of a new type of turret for their main guns which were capable of 75-degree elevation, improving their AA capabilities.

During the [[wikipedia:Pacific War|Pacific War]] the Yūgumo-class served in the IJN's 2nd, 10th, 31st and 32nd destroyer divisions.
