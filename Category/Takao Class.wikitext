[[Category:Heavy Cruisers]]The Takao-class (高雄型) was a class of four heavy cruisers of the Imperial Japanese Navy launched between May 1930 and April 1931.

They were an evolution from the preceding ''Myoko''-class, with heavier torpedo armamanent and had an almost battleship-like, large bridge structure.Their main gun armament was ten [[20.3cm Twin Gun Mount|20 cm (8 in)]] guns in twin mounts and they were also armed with sixteen [[61cm Quad Torpedo Mount|24 inch Long Lance torpedoes]](carrying more than the ''Myokos'' or ''Mogamis''), making the ''Takaos'' the most heavily armed cruisers of the IJN. The only flaw was that they were considered top-heavy and thus prone to capsizing, while Turret #3 had a poor firing arc. These two problems were rectified in the follow-up ''Mogamis''; nonetheless the ''Takaos'' were considered the best cruisers that the IJN ever built.
