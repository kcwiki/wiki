The Mutsuki-class destroyers (睦月型駆逐艦) were an improved version of the Kamikaze class destroyers and were ordered under the 1923 fiscal budget. Unlike the Kamikaze and Minekaze-class, the Mutsuki-class were retained as first line destroyers due to their range and their more powerful torpedo armament (Type 93 Torpedo) . They were modernized between 1936 and 1937 and then again between 1941 and 1942, which extended their useful lives as well as increased their anti-aircraft and anti-submarine capabilities, thus allowing them to participate in the upcoming Pacific War.

Also the Mutsuki-class ships had only hull numbers at first due to the projected Eight-eight fleet plan, which proved to be unpopular with their crews due as they were a constant source of confusion in communications. Thus, they were given names at August 1928, taken from traditional poetic names of the months of the year by the Lunar calendar or phases of the moon.
