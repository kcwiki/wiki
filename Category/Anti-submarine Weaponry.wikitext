Equipment that boosts the ASW capabilities of ships. In-game, these are generally depth charges, sonars, and aircraft bombers, though the [[12.7cm Twin High-Angle Mount (Late Model)]] technically provides a boost to the ASW stat. Autogyros, liaison aircraft, and MAD (Magnetic anomaly detectors) were also used by the IJN, but only the former two have been implemented ([[Ka-type Observation Autogyro]] and [[Type 3 Spotter/Liaison (ASW)]]).
