I suggest merging some sections like "Kancolle Arcade" and "Kancolle Kai" into "Spin-off Games" or something until more images or whatever are uploaded. I'm moving a lot of this stuff into simple galleries to make the page less lengthy; if people want to see the full-sized images on-page, there's that extension we got a few months ago. If anyone has serious objections to this, feel free to undo my changes. [[User:Wsewolod|Wsewolod]] ([[User talk:Wsewolod|talk]]) 22:47, 26 October 2015 (UTC)

:Well, I've gone through and done just this, collapsing sections into their pages. I'd suggest we also do something about the sprawl of the Goods. We don't need to have photos of every single poster and nendo and all that on the media page itself; rather, we should just have one for each section, and link to that section.
