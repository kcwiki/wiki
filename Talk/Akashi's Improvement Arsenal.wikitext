I intend to do some extensive furnishing of this page, and I'd like to hear (read) people's input particularly about equipment grouping; small/medium guns, large guns, secondary guns, AP Shells/AA guns/fire directors, torpedoes, and ASW gear are the current clusters. In some places this looks fragmented, while in others it looks a bit too spread out. Suggestions regarding table format, missing information, or testing (Particularly with the ASW improvements) can be posted here to be reviewed and hopefully implemented.

:I had changed that earlier on request, but it is difficult to see since Kinugasa can still improve them that day (Hence its green background). I'm brainstorming ways to make this easier to read since, frankly, I hate the way it looks currently.

The main table doesn't render properly for some resolutions; must fix promptly. [[User:Wsewolod|Wsewolod]] ([[User talk:Wsewolod|talk]]) 04:42, 16 July 2015 (UTC)
