Each block is really long, making the stats columns unnecessarily narrow and vacant. One solution would be deleting the break between the English and Japanese names. The longest entry on this page (and probably most of these lists) would be the 10cm HA + FD, which would display as follows:

I chose this as the ugliest example the change would bring about; possible ways to make the English-Japanese transition more seemly would be putting the latter in parentheses, italics, or a smaller font. [[User:Wsewolod|Wsewolod]] ([[User talk:Wsewolod|talk]]) 21:40, 19 June 2015 (UTC)
