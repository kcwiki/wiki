{{lang|ja|ライブ}} -> Live
*Should this be changed to "concert"? I see a lot of subbers retain "live", but I'm not sure if it's fully in the spirit of translation.

{{lang|ja|夏は、どんなステップで踊る？}} -> For summer, what do you want to dance?
*Should this be changed to "what dance do you want to do" or something similar?

Somewhat unrelated; should we add links to kanmusu mentioned in lines? I don't care either way, but I'm throwing the idea out there.

It does look excellent as it stands. [[User:Wsewolod|Wsewolod]] ([[User talk:Wsewolod|talk]]) 03:23, 5 July 2015 (UTC)
