==Translation Notes==
*''Note 1: While this uses the most common translation of "ヒ", it really could be anything, since this is in Katakana only. It could mean "flames". All have been used in different contexts with other Abyssals.''
*''Note 0: "落ちろ": Fall, Go down, or drop; not quite "Sink", but very close in this context.''
*''Note 2: In the game rips, she sounds as if she's remarking on the player's ships saying "索敵！" during battle, so this was given 「quotes」 to differentiate here.''
*''Note 3: Somewhat hard to translate this to English due to the changing of Hiragana to Katakana.'' - [[User:Totlmstr]]
