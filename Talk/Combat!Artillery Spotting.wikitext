This page is very much out-of-date; I've tried to update it based on the following sources:

http://ja.kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/%E5%BC%BE%E7%9D%80%E8%A6%B3%E6%B8%AC%E5%B0%84%E6%92%83

http://ja.kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/%E3%82%B9%E3%83%AC%E3%83%83%E3%83%89:700

But the first-order questions really are:
*How much we want to take the KC Kai formulae that have been data-mined at face value and make the assumption that KC Kai formulae are a carbon copy of the KC browser game formulae
*How outdated the JA Verification Wiki pages are, as well as any caveats they have regarding their tests / experiments
*Any more recent tests / experiments we can find elsewhere

I raise these points because there is conflicting information from different sources, especially regarding the following:
*To what extent Luck affects Artillery Spotting
*To what extent the size of a recon seaplane slot affects Artillery Spotting
