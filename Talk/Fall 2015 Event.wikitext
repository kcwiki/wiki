==Acecipher's To-do==
*Put up Tweets to provide evidence
*Find references for speculation - Kinda did that when I linked the wiki articles for Kolombangara - Totaku
*Push what has come to be usual to the main event page

==Wsewolod's To-do==
*Destroy the event map template and make something better
*Dozens of other projects I can't recall at the moment. [[User:Wsewolod|Wsewolod]] ([[User talk:Wsewolod|talk]]) 21:55, 13 October 2015 (UTC)

== Regarding rewards ==

I cleared E2 on Easy and I received the following rewards: Battle Ration x1, Reinforcement Expansion x1, Mamiya x1.  The Event page mentions that the only reward for E-2 clear on easy is Battle Ration x1.  Did I miss something ? (feel free to delete if this has been addressed already)

:Late response, but thanks for your input. People seem to only look at what the wikiwiki page has posted without trying to reference anything else, so it's useful to have someone who has just cleared it post what they received.

:Wikia indicates that instead of a [[Reinforcement Expansions]], clearing easy yields a repair goddess. Could someone check this? [[User:Wsewolod|Wsewolod]] ([[User talk:Wsewolod|talk]]) 00:29, 26 November 2015 (UTC)
