The pastebins need to be converted into proper update pages. This is fairly time-consuming, so I'd rather not have to do them all. Feel free to insert appropriate images; for example, in December 11th, 2013's page, an image of [[Kiso]]'s kai ni sprite would be appropriate.

:This is nearly done, so thanks a heap, [[User:IbarakiIbuki]]. Posting this here as a reminder to everyone concerned that the dumped pages could use reformatting in compliance with [[Game Updates/2015/July 31st]]; they should include hash-tag and asterisk mark-up for indentation. Additionally:
:*bold and italicized type should be used where appropriate; 
:*images should be inserted where appropriate (for example, [[Kiso]]'s Kai Ni CG, as found in [[Kiso/Gallery]], on the [[Game_Updates/2013/December_11th|December 13th page]]); 
:*a discussion should be held about whether to use galleries or right-hanging images for such instances;
:*internal links should be added, particularly for kanmusu names (good job with that so far), and links to game mechanics (like [[Morale and Fatigue]] or [[Exercises]] for updates implementing balance or bug fixes to those mechanics); 
:*and grammar and phrasing should be modified (encyclopedic tones should be used over conversational ones, common nouns shouldn't be capitalized except at the end of a sentence, und so weiter). 
:Since I'm the one most picky about that last point, I'll try to do that myself. Thanks. [[User:Wsewolod|Wsewolod]] ([[User talk:Wsewolod|talk]]) 16:26, 3 September 2015 (UTC)
