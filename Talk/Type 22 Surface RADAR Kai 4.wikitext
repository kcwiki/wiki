This proposal has been bounced around a bit here I think, and underwent a lot of discussion on the old wiki; can this equipment be renamed to "...Kai Yon" rather than "...Kai 4"? Some areas of the wiki use "Kai-2" in reference to ships' second remodels, but I think the consensus is using "Kai Ni", and that looks a lot better to me. Thoughts, ideas?

::Kai Yon looks dumb as hell. Kai-4 or Kai 4 for those. At the same time, Kai Ni does look better than Kai-2 or Kai 2 so it becomes a consistency issue at that point. Personally, my opinion is to keep Kai 4 for the radar. [[User:Remi Scarlet|Remi Scarlet]] ([[User talk:Remi Scarlet|talk]]) 01:47, 8 June 2015 (UTC)
:::I think Kai4 reads better than Kai Yon, and I like Kai Ni more than Kai 2. That also leaves with what to do with a 3rd Remodel? [[User:Patches|Patches]] ([[User talk:Patches|talk]]) 04:26, June 8, 2015  (UTC)
:::Personally I think Kai Yon would be confusing if I didn't know Japanese. Kai Ni is somewhat acceptable since it's so commonplace with the ships themselves. When ships start getting multiple remodels, we can start renaming Kai 3 into Kai [Whatever it is]. [[User:Acecipher|Acecipher]] ([[User talk:Acecipher|talk]]) 04:46, 8 June 2015 (UTC)
:::So the consensus is leaving it as is. Well, less work. [[User:Wsewolod|Wsewolod]] ([[User talk:Wsewolod|talk]]) 12:55, 8 June 2015 (UTC)
