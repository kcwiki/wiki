Hi all: we have specific boards for [[Kancolle_Wiki:Translation|Translations]] [https://trello.com/b/SfalyAi2 (Trello Board)] and [[Kancolle_Wiki:Content_and_Grammar|Content and Grammar]] [https://trello.com/b/wbasB48X (Trello Board)]. Please also keep track of your work on Trello so we can efficiently coordinate everyone's efforts at setting up this wiki and minimize the inanity that goes on here. Also, feel free to come on the IRC; it's usually pretty lively (whereas we might not check here until we think to do so).

== Remodel Redirection ==

Currently, all "non-base" names such as [[Aircraft_Carrier_Princess_Kai_III]] or [[Ooyodo_Kai]] lead to a 404 page instead of the proper "base" form, such as [[Aircraft Carrier Princess]] or [[Ooyodo]].

This can probably be fixed easily.

== Stock Equipment ==

Is there a fixed format we should be using when entering stock equipment, specifically for planes? I've been entering it for some ships, and I was just doing [[Mogami]] and I found some inconsisntencies. For example, [[Yamashiro]] has the number after the plane name, whereas [[Chitose]]/[[Chiyoda]] have it before. They also all have Zuiun (at one point or another) and have different names for it. Same is true for the Zero Recon Plane. It is listed as Type-0 water reconnaissance aircraft on Chiyo/Chito, but as Zero Recon Seaplane on Yamashiro.

Related, the [[Equipment]] and [[Development]] pages also have different names for some of the weapons.

:I usually do it as <nowiki>[[Equipment Name]]</nowiki> and add the slot plane capacity in the right side if the ships can carry planes (e.g. [[Maya]]) irrespective of the stock equipment. But looking at kancolle UI, it's more consistent if we put the slot plane capacity first. For the equipment name, i grab it from the [[Equipment]] page so if anyone had more correct translation for each equipment, please start modifying from there.
:Regardless, i sincerely wish we will have an agreement regarding these inconsistency issues. -[[User:Silfumus|silfumus]]<sup>[<span title="Talk to me please!" style="color:red nowrap;">[[User_talk:Silfumus|talk]]</span>]</sup> 06:02, October 3, 2013 (UTC)

==Is there a Mod in the house?==
Yes?
If you ever do need to contact us, we're on the IRC pretty regularly.

==Front Page Remodel==
I know [[User:Gensui Hime|Gensuihime]] has been extremely busy, but I was wondering what plans there are for renovating the front page; it's still extremely reminiscent of Wikia. The quality of front pages that appeals to me most is effective use of space, which is evident in the [http://www.mariowiki.com/ Mario Wiki] and, of course, [http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Wiki Touhou Wiki].

:This week and the next are '''Total Renovation Weeks''' as far as my calendar is concerned, I will actually be able to create the pages. If anyone has designs they already had in mind leave them on my talk page. The best one gets to be created! [[User:Gensui Hime|Gensui Hime]] ([[User talk:Gensui Hime|talk]]) 14:55, 7 June 2015 (UTC)

== Complete Makeover==
I've completed the full remaster of the frontpage, and in addition, added parameter passing so that modification of update dates are much easier. Complaints and questions should be addressed here.

==Link to Himeuta is Broken==

The link to the Himeuta Forums is broken. It currently links to himeuta.net, should it be changed to himeuta.org? [[User:Bwm1021|Bwm1021]] ([[User talk:Bwm1021|talk]]) 06 October 2019
