== Page Layout ==
Am i the only one who hate the glossary page's current layout? using table just add unnecessary complexity.<br />Personally i prefer the page to be similar to the FAQ or [http://www56.atwiki.jp/kancolle/pages/17.html atwiki] page.<br />
At least, it's easier to edit. Feel free to comment! -[[User:Silfumus|silfumus]]<sup>[<span title="Talk to me please!" style="color:red nowrap;">[[User_talk:Silfumus|talk]]</span>]</sup> 09:05, October 2, 2013 (UTC)

The whole page is a mess and is in need of additional content and corrections.  CDRW set it up and started it, but everyone else hasn't gotten around to touching it much afterwards.  If you're feeling brave you can contribute a little to it.  -[[User:Pagoda Bridge|Pagoda Bridge]] ([[User talk:Pagoda Bridge|talk]]) 12:48, October 2, 2013 (UTC)
