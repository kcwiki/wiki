Do people like the "notes" inside the template, or should it only be used when the note relates to which classes can equip the item? [[User:Wsewolod|Wsewolod]] ([[User talk:Wsewolod|talk]]) 16:57, 21 October 2015 (UTC)

Personal opinion, I feel the notes can be used if say for example, certain ships are allowed to equip certain items that's not dedicated to an entire class (Example: Abukuma and Midget Subs) or expressing unique properties like fitting bonuses / penalties.
