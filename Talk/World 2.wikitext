About This Map 2 =
Quest Bm7 LOS. (Consists of 1 CA 1 CL 4 DD. You MUST deploy to World 2-5, and obtain an S-Rank victory at the boss node. Flagship MUST be DD. (CAV can't be use for this quest.)
The LOS still Unknown... (i got nothing from other source as well. sorry) Random ? i doubt that.

:I added in an additional "recommended fleet composition" for the north route to accommodate the [[Quests#Bm7|Bm7]] monthly and did a little cleanup here and there. Revising the sortie world pages is certainly a priority, being as high-traffic and informative as they are compared to other pages.
