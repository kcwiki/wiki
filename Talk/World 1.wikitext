I have Try 1-5 hundred times,
so my composition for always got S-Rank on boss node is =
Slot 1 = CVL (any Torp / Bomb 3, 1 Saiun | x1 on Higest Slot Torp or bomber, x2 Type 3 Liaison, x1 Saiun)
Slot 2 = BBV ( 4 Zuiun or x2 Type Ka Liaison, 2 best Zuiun)
Slot 3 = DD (SONAR, DC, SONAR)
Slot 4 = CL (SONAR, DC, SONAR)

About 1-4
is the "better" place than 2-1 for Complete Quest = [Bd4,Bw2] low HQ Exp, safest (if you got at least 3 SS). more CVL/CV to kill.
About 1-1
The Quickest Place to Complete Quest = [Bw1] low HQ Exp, safest.
About 1-6
the Quickest, Low HQ Exp & Safest to Complete Quest = [Bd8,Bw5] even Lv 1 Fodder Can Do that.

:Yeah, we could do with a lot of sortie-world tip revamping; I'll add these in as I have time and probably delete some of the existing stuff.[[User:Wsewolod|Wsewolod]] ([[User talk:Wsewolod|talk]]) 22:01, 13 May 2015 (UTC)

I think you might revised 1-4, CV/CVL quest was on 2-1 or 2-3. 2-2 was transport Quest. and Battleship Fishing.
(PS) where's grinding tips page ?
I got some stuff about grinding/Leveling.
Even maruyu Fast Grinding (23 sortie = Lv.20 Ready to be a Luck Fodder)
:I'd be interested in discussing with people about adding a grinding page or something similar noting common methods of leveling and farming such as 1-5, 3-2, 4-3, 5-4 etc. [[User:Remi Scarlet|Remi Scarlet]] ([[User talk:Remi Scarlet|talk]]) 22:21, 15 May 2015 (UTC)
