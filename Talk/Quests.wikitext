==Japanese ship names in quest description?==
Vote Requested. Do people prefer description (specifically the fleet requirement/completion condition) to also have the Japanese names?
*Example of Japanese name included: Completion Condition: Have [[Tenryuu]] ({{lang|ja|天龍}}) and [[Tatsuta]] ({{lang|ja|龍田}}) in the same fleet.
*Example of Japanese name excluded: Completion Condition: Have [[Tenryuu]] and [[Tatsuta]] in the same fleet.
