==To-Do List==
Things that still need updating as of current day, current time:
*Branching Rules - These are already on other site, pretty much just need to be ported in.
*Stage Guides for 5-3, 5-4, 5-5.
**Quest req outlines where applicable.
**Vetting/Peer Review once Stage Guides are done. And Air Control System.
*What are we going to do about Drop tables? (This is a larger-scale question that needs to be applied site-wide too.)
**My sense is not really necessary these days especially since that can to some extent be outsourced to external databases e.g. [https://db.kcwiki.org/drop/ KCWiki.org] but IDK.
