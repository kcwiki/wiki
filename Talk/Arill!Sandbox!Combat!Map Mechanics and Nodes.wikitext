Probably the only one I have comments on I guess. Use of tabber here feels a bit excessive, if I had to I would split into:
* Non-Combat Nodes (Start, Resource, False Alarm / No Battle Red-to-Blue, Choice Node, TP Node, "End" Node i.e. 1-6 endpoint or on occasion the end nodes you see in, say, [[Fall_2017_Event#E-1|Fall 2017 E-1]])
* "Normal" Combat Nodes (Day Battle, Night Battle, Night-to-Day Battle, Boss Battle)
**Might be worth mentioning we haven't seen NtD again since Fall 2017?
* "Short" Combat Nodes (Air Raid, Air Battle, Ambush)

... And then maybe use tabber for those individual sub-sections?
