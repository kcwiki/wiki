For the record, I know my edit comments make me seem like a massive flaming faggot, but I'm just trying to remind Totaku to actually spellcheck his stuff via edit comments since I'm not on Discord at the moment. He sometimes (unintentionally) makes a lot of mistakes even when transcribing someone else's stuff, although I dunno who actually caused the errors here. - [[User:Soloblast|Soloblast]] 1120H, 17 Oct 2017 (UTC)
