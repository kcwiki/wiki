<u>Overview:</u>[[File:World_1-5.jpg|right|400px|World 1-5]]
A relatively easy map. Low xp gain so used early on or for DD/CL which are cheaper to sortie.

<u>Suggested Composition</u>: 4+ DD/CL (Other classes can be included as well but you should include some ASW capable ships to improve ranking).

<u>Equipment</u>: Focus on ASW equipment such as sonars and depth charges as you will only face SS.

<u>Guide:</u>
*The first three nodes are relatively easy and it is recommended that you end after 3 nodes. Use formation Line Abreast.
* 4 or less ships will head to C; more than that will head to D.
* The boss node can be reached if you use a composition of 4 ships composing of: 1 CVL or AV, 2 or less CL, DD. A BBV can also be added for an additional shelling phase)

<u>Tips:</u>
*All the non dead end nodes are composed of SS.
*F and G are dead end nodes that have strong enemy ships.
*Use the formation Line Abreast as this is the strongest ASW formation. (Requires a minimum of 4 ships)
*Third node has the possibility to drop SS with S rank.
*Going to boss node allows more chances to drop SS. However this also gives a lot of HQ xp, which can make it difficult later as events often increase in difficulty.

<u>Pros</u>: 
*Easy, and simple to unlock
*Slow to moderate morale drain.
<u>Cons</u>:
*Low Base XP

<u>Notes</u>: Increases in difficulty at HQ levels 40 and 80 with higher chance to get SS as drop. First node switches to Elite SS after level 80 which makes the map more difficult after that point.
