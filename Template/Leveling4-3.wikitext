<u>Overview</u>:[[File:4-3 Map.jpg|thumb|400x400px]]
This map is specialized for grinding ASW capable ships, DD, CL, CVL. Farming this map requires careful planning of ships as well as equipment. The requirements are more specific and there is much less leeway for customization compared to other maps. The nodes we farm in 4-3 are partial submarine nodes escorted by few small vessels (DD, CL), making this optimal for grinding. However there is a chance to be sent to node J which contains deadly BB, CA, or CVL. In order to survive node J, decent equipment, moderately high level and max stats (AA exception) is recommended.

<u>Map Guide</u>:

Branching rules (according to the Kancolle Wikiwiki):
* Having 2 or more DDs will always direct you to
node A, which has BBs. 1 or less directs you to F or J.
* You MUST have 2+ CAs (not CAV) to go from F->G.
* Having 1 or more CAV/AV will direct you from J->K. Similarly, 1 or more CAV/AV will direct you from B->D.
* Any other setups will result in random zig-zags.
<u>Ship Setup:</u>
* Ship you intend to level as flagship (DD, CL, CVL)

* 2CVL – for opening bombing and ASW support

* 1 BB(V) – for 2<sup>nd</sup> shelling and killing any stray ships that survives opening bombing

* 2 Wildcards that will not fulfill any branching rule above
<u>Equipment:</u>
* Flagship –ASW (Sonar + Depth Charge combo)
* CVL
** Enough fighters for AS (81)
** It is not recommended to aim for AS+ (162) as it will reduce damage output
** Bombers should prioritize ASW rather than Torp or Dive Bomb stats
** Saiun is recommend
** You may use Type 3/Autogyro for lower slots (≤8)
* BB(V) – Artillery spotting setup, no seaplane bombers
* DD, CL – ASW (No Sonar + Depth Charge combo)
* CLT – Midget Sub + Torp + ASW (No Sonar + Depth Charge combo) 
<u>Tips:</u>
*  Flagship should have Sonar + Depth Charge combo while other ASW ships should not. This is to ensure the Flagship secures MVP.
*  CVL should have dual purpose for opening bombing and ASW
*  CLT can be important for minimizing damage in node J, as well as assist in ASW
*  Bringing SS can minimize damage in node J
*   
<u>Pros</u>:
*  Relatively high rate of Exp for small vessels (DD, CL)
*  2 farming nodes 
<u>Cons</u>:
* Require careful planning and complex setup
* CVL is prone to steal MVP
* Node J contain BB, CA, or CVL depending on pattern and may critically damage your ships
