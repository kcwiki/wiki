<u>Overview</u>:[[File:5-4 Map.jpg|thumb|400x400px|]]
This map is primarily used for farming HQ Exp, however it is somewhat possible to level certain ships by modifying the standard setup. Due to branching rules, you may only level '''FAST '''ships in this map. There is another method that allow you to level SLOW ships on this map, which will be written in another section.

<u>Guide</u>:

The standard setup for farming HQ Exp is 2 BB, 1 CLT, 1 CAV/CL (with 4 slots), 2 CV. The CAV/CL must carry 4 drum canisters. We will modify this setup by removing the CLT and adding the ship you wish to level as the flagship. Remember, the ship you are trying to level must be '''FAST''' or else you will hit a maelstrom.

<u>Equipment</u>:

BB(V)/CA(V)/CL: Artillery Spotting Setup, consider AA Radar for auxiliary

CV: AS+ Setup (Suggested Air power: 305)

If your leveling ship is too weak to obtain MVP, use AA Cut-in setup so she won't be a complete deadweight.

<u>Tips</u>:
* This map is good for leveling ships who have difficulty obtaining MVP, particularly CA. With high base Exp, this map is the best way for leveling those ships.
* Considering using lower leveled CV/BB as the nodes are all pretty easy while very rewarding. This way those ships can be trained too.
*  The higher powered kai-2 CA/V are reasonably effective on this map.
* Node H has the highest Air power of all nodes. AS+ requirements are of the following:
** Pattern 1: 348
** Pattern 2: 300 (suggested: 305)
** Pattern 3: 249 (alternative: 254)
For the best performance to cost ratio, configure your CV loadout to fulfill these AS+ requirements. Higher Air power means lower damage so do some experimenting on your own to find the optimal setup for you. It typically isn't worth bringing 3 CV/L to meet AS requirements, so Kaga can be helpful to bring with her high slots.

<u>Pros</u>:
* High base Exp
* Many rare drops
* Many CV/CVL drops for those AA modernization material
* Simultaneously farm HQ Exp
<u>Cons</u>:
* Unless you leveling ships is a BB, she is very unlikely to get MVP
* Not bucket friendly
* Requires more bauxite as there is stronger opposition.  (Generally around 120 bauxite per run)
