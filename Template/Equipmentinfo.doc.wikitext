* Parameters need not follow the order shown below, however it is highly recommended for easier editing
* For ship class coloring:
:*Use color <span style="color:lime;">lime</span> (e.g. '''| DD=lime''') if all ships in that classification can equip it.
:*Use color <span style="color:yellow;">yellow</span> (e.g. '''| DD=yellow''') if only some ships in that classification can equip it; in this case, also use the '''|notes=''' to indicate why.
* Fast battleship : Kongou-class, Bismarck, V.Veneto-class, Iowa-class
* Use '''| radius= ''' if it's a plane of some type, as it deals with combat radius as pertains to [[Land-Based Air Squadron]].
* In '''| image= ''' column, it can be a single image or gallery (see demo below)
* There are a few ships categories that are currently only populated by 1 ship each:
:*"LC": Amphibious Assault Ship ([[Akitsu Maru]])
:*"AS": Submarine Tender ([[Taigei]])
:*"AR": Repair Ship ([[Akashi]])
:*"AO": Supply Ship ([[Hayasui]])
* "color" should be empty unless change in background color is desired
* We use [[46cm Triple Gun Mount]] as an example for finalizing the layout for this template. If you don't know how to make equipment pages please read the <span class="plainlinks">[http://en.kancollewiki.net/index.php?title=46cm_Triple_Gun_Mount&action=edit source code]</span> first.
