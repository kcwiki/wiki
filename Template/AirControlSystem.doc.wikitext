This system is a template to list the highest required fighter power for maps.

Most commonly, the boss routing should be used, if maps have different AS requirements depending on their boss routing (e.g. 4-5 H node routing which has 504), that can be noted down in the other notes section, if the routes are very different (such as in 3-5), creating two ACS charts and nesting them side by side is an option.

AS+ is defined as three times the enemy fighter power, AS as 1.5 times, and AP as being at least two-thirds (to find this, multiply the AS+ requirement by 2/9).

Template has been edited to automatically calculate AS+ and AP values based on a stated AS value

Note that the "Fleet" and "Other Notes" boxes only appear if values are provided for them!

Tables may also be nested next to each other, especially useful for multiple routes and/or final forms.

For example:

<code>
{{<nowiki />AirControlSystem

| Map = 4-5 Pre-Final

| Fleet = 3CA 2CV BBV

| AS = 207

| Notes = 504/252 for AS+/AS if going through H node

}}
</code>

Results in:

{{AirControlSystem
| Map = 4-5 Pre-Final
| Fleet = 3CA 2CV BBV
| AS = 207
| Notes = 504/252 for AS+/AS if going through H node}}
