''' Preferred if all fields are filled. Slideshow is absolutely necessary!'''

NOTE: Dynamic slideshow height adjustment is also a desired feature, and if anyone can actually make it possible, that would be awesome.

There are four color codes for the template, which is determined by the type variable:

figure = #cc74bd

nendo = #49ff45

figma = #0266c8

other = #d3d3d3

Multiple variables can be used with this template. As stated before, slideshow is a must because the image code broke... So somehow slideshows are possible but individual images aren't.

Variables possible are:

<pre>
name - The name inside the header window. 
jpname - Secondary italic name, for alternative Japanese names.
type - Type of the figurine. There are 4 kinds, as written above.
scale - The scale ratio.
price - Price. MSRP preempts the need to mention 'Before Tax'.
date - Date released.
specs - The specifications.
sculpt - Sculptor of the figurine.
info - Detailed information on the figurine.
slideshow - Self Explanatory. ABSOLUTELY MUST BE INCLUDED IN CODE
</pre>


Use this code for the slideshow:

<pre>
<gallery type="slideshow" widths="360px" position="center" hideaddbutton="false">

</gallery>
</pre>



Where the names of the desired images for the slideshow can be entered into the space before </gallery>.

So far there have been no limitations discovered in the code but if any are found please send a message to Gensui Hime.

Below is a sample:

<pre>
{{FigureInfo
| name = Final Boss
| jpname = さいごのぼす
| type = nendo
| scale = 1/1
| price = priceless
| date = beginning of time
| specs = Power to end worlds.
| sculpt = DMM
| info = The final boss of DMM. Known to appear frequently on error pages.
| slideshow=<gallery type="slideshow" widths="360px" position="center" hideaddbutton="true">NPC_FinalBoss.png
</gallery>
}}
</pre>

Example 2:
