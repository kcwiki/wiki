==Usage==
Format: <nowiki>{{Installation|1= (optional)|2= (optional)}}</nowiki>:
*Variable 1= replaces the first instance of the page name to something else you indicate. For example, <nowiki>{{Installation|1=Test}}</nowiki> would begin with the text ''Test is a plane-using installation-type enemy ...'' regardless of where you put the template.
*Variable 2= should either be '''her''' or '''its''' (it's meant to be a possessive pronoun). It is also used to put either the pronoun "She" or the pagename in other sentences. Note that the text is case-sensitive.
Use on any Installation-type Abyssal ships that utilize planes.<br>
For those who don't, use {{tl|PlanelessInstallation}} instead. For those that can be either depending on equipment setup, use {{tl|HybridInstallation}}.<br>
Note that a switch template exist as different equipment are effective against different enemies (add in switch statements in cases where it's not the usual Type 3+WG42).<br>
The inclusion of this template automatically adds [[:Category:Abyssal Land Bases]] to the page.
