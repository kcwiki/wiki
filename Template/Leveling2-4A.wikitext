<u>Overview</u>: [[File:2-4 Map.jpg|thumb|400x400px]]
A map that's not too difficult for low level admirals who have the right vessels. This map is generally for leveling ships that are armor and firepower heavy. Eg CA(V), BB(V), CV(L). The node offers a decent amount of exp at the cost of morale so be aware of that. Not as effective as 3-2 so use it as a leveling spot with the goal of clearing 2-4 to advance to 3-2.

<u>Suggested Composition</u>: Place the ship you want to level as flagship (CV or BB recommended).  Try to include 1 BB to enter second shelling phase.  Include CV/L with bombers to reduce the enemy numbers and allow artillery spotting.

<u>Alternate Composition</u>: Use a BB or CV (blue planes) as flagship. Fill the rest of the slots with spare CA drops.  

<u>Tips</u>:
* Try to utilize artillery spotting if possible.  (e.g. 1 seaplane + 2 main guns). Refer to [[Combat#Combat_Equipment_Setup|Combat]] guide for more details on equipment setups.
* When using carriers and battleships, don't bother sticking them into the repair docks until they hit minor damage to moderate damage. Since minor damage could easily result in a 1hr timer, just bucket them after some damage. Take note that light damage does not put a disadvantage on ships. Only moderate damage does.
* Enemy fleet does not have any air power, so there is no need for fighter (green) planes: Use torpedo (blue) and dive (red) bombers instead.
* Never go past the 2nd node. 3rd node will have enemy carriers and battleships and is unsuitable for farming.
<u>Notes</u>: The nodes after the first are progressively more difficult.  You can try them out to get a feeling for the difficulty.  Take your time to let your ships recover from fatigue.
