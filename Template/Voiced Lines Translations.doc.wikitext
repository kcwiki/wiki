==Usage==
A neat(?) way to assemble ship lines.
==Parameters==

<pre>{{Voiced Lines Translations
| Type = what type of line is it, if it's a special case (such as seasonal)
| Situation = Under what situation this line is spoken (ignore if Type is set)
| Filename = Name of the audio file, without the extension (.ogg)
| Name = Name of ship (only include if Type is set)
| Original Japanese Line = original line in Japanese
| English Translation = translated line
| Notes = any particular notes
}}</pre>

===Requirements and Format===
A minimum of three parts are needed for assembling the table:

<code><nowiki>{{Voiced Lines Translations/Header}} (table header; pass appropriate Type= where necessary)</nowiki> <br/>
<nowiki>{{Voiced Lines Translations</nowiki> <br/>
(the parameters as explained above) <br/>
<nowiki>}}</nowiki><br/>
|} (table closing brace)<br/></code>

When adding in new quotes, make sure to do so '''above''' <code>|}</code>.

{{tl|VLT}} is an alias for this template, while {{tl|VLTH}} is an alias for the header. Thus alternatively, you can also use 

<code><nowiki>{{VLTH}}</nowiki> <br/>
<nowiki>{{VLT</nowiki> <br/>
(the parameters as explained above) <br/>
<nowiki>}}</nowiki><br/>
|}<br/></code>

to accomplish the same thing.

===Example===
<pre>{{Voiced Lines Translations/Header}}
{{Voiced Lines Translations
 |Situation = Repair
 |Name = Yukikaze
 |Original Japanese Line = しれぇ……最近雨の日がおおいです。制服や洗濯物が乾きにくくて困りますね。しれぇ♪
 |English Translation = Commander... There are many rainy days lately. Laundries aren't being dried, what a bother, Commander♪
}}
|}</pre>
