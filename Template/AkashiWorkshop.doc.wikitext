This is just a template to serve as the header for the Akashi's workshop document.

While the template includes the headers, because of how the template is called, it does not end and requires manually closing the table at the end with 

"|}"

Refer to [[Template:AkashiWorkshopLine]] for theoretical use case and examples.
