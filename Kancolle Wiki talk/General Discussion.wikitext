Do we want this page to serve as an on-site discussion base about the game in general (Oh, I got xxx and xxx from LSC today!) or as a hub for discussing the wiki? If the latter is the case, perhaps it should be moved to a more suitable title. At the moment I'm furnishing the page itself as a general wiki-usage guide.

:There is now a designated page for [[Help:Editing|editing help]], so this page (unless someone says otherwise) can be for discussion about the wiki as a whole. [[User:Wsewolod|Wsewolod]] ([[User talk:Wsewolod|talk]]) 19:01, 3 June 2015 (UTC)
