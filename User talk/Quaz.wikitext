Thank you, thank you, thank you for updating [[List of Secondary Guns by stats]]; these are a series of pages I and others have overlooked while adding new equipment to the wiki, despite being linked to by a very prevalent template at the bottom of every equipment page. [[List of Main Guns by stats]] is missing both Italian large caliber guns as well as the [[15.2cm Twin Gun Mount Kai]] if you feel up to it, otherwise I'll add those in later today or tomorrow.
