My input: 
While I'm wholly opposed to implementing userboxes on this wiki, having some distinct-looking indication of a user's language proficiency (which is especially relevant here, where the bulk of the active workload is translation in way) would be great so we know who to bug instead of throwing all of the work onto certain users.

Additionally, I don't mind the Babel classifications; as long as people aren't being overconfident morons.[[User:Wsewolod|Wsewolod]] ([[User talk:Wsewolod|talk]]) 08:19, 20 July 2015 (UTC)

:I fiddled around a bit and came up with:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; border:1px solid darkblue; background: lightblue; {{border-radius|5px}};"
! |jb-0
! |hp
! |hp-5
! |pp-3

|I am completely inept at speaking or writing in gibberish. 
|I have spoken and written in hyperboles ever since I was conceived.
|My half-lifetime of overusing hyperboles has forged me into a true veteran in their overuse.
|I previously worked on poopwiki fixing many minor errors, and I am therefore very confident in getting "down and dirty" with repulsive wiki poop.

:Columns are comprised of the Babel language classification (made-up ones in this case) and a concise description of why you are at that level or what experience you have with that language. [[User:Wsewolod|Wsewolod]] ([[User talk:Wsewolod|talk]]) 08:38, 20 July 2015 (UTC)

:::Remi, on Tadoritsuita's main page he links the wikipedia article where this apparently originates from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Babel that's the only source I can really find for it.
