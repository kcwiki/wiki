''"15:07:05 '''Iona''' I really advise to swap the map image and the data block''<br>
''15:07:22 '''Iona''' the map would look better on the right''<br>
''15:09:27 '''Iona''' one of the reasons being that the map it typically not as tall as the data block"''

Suggestion from IRC. In theory it sounds better to me, but I don't think I could get used to these things being right-aligned until more of the site is like that. [[User:Wsewolod|Wsewolod]] ([[User talk:Wsewolod|talk]]) 20:24, 4 October 2015 (UTC)
