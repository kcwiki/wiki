==Re: Arsenal Tables==
It's a wiki, I'm okay with everything I write getting overwritten when new information comes out.  Until then, bad or missing information needs replacing, and this is an area I can work on without assistance or collaboration. --[[User:DeMatt|DeMatt]] ([[User talk:DeMatt|talk]]) 21:50, 28 November 2020 (UTC)

== Images for Spring 2021 Event Tags 5 and 6 ==

I have noticed a problem.  The images for Event Tag #5 [[File:Spring2021EventTag5.png]] and Event Tag #6 [[File:Spring2021EventTag6.png]] were uploaded as "grey = 5" and "yellow = 6"... but the wiki has been written as "yellow = 5" and "grey = 6".  Is it possible for you to correct this by swapping the image files, or should I fix it in the text?  --[[User:DeMatt|DeMatt]] ([[User talk:DeMatt|talk]]) 18:45, 12 June 2021 (UTC)

...well, better I look like an idiot asking about a fixed problem, than act like an idiot in trying to fix what isn't broken.  Thanks. --[[User:DeMatt|DeMatt]] ([[User talk:DeMatt|talk]]) 06:29, 13 June 2021 (UTC)
