Is there any method to include the <code><nowiki><slideshow></nowiki></code> code into the LUA function as I experimented that specific code, it just print out the whole sentence instead of running the extension. - [[User:KyoriAsh|KyoriAsh]] ([[User talk:KyoriAsh|talk]]) 13:11, 19 September 2016 (UTC)

:I think that <code><nowiki><slideshow></nowiki></code> had to be done in Template in order to bring it into module as I can see several template is able to use it by implementing in module - [[User:KyoriAsh|KyoriAsh]] ([[User talk:KyoriAsh|talk]]) 08:37, 22 September 2016 (UTC)
