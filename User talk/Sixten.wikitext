If you're going to write [http://en.kancollewiki.net/index.php?title=Fall_2016_Event&oldid=309612#E-4 like how you did on the E-4 event page], please be more formal about it. - [[User:EchIII|EchIII]] ([[User talk:EchIII|talk]]) 05:28, 22 November 2016 (UTC)

I'm going to step in and say that while I do understand what was being noted here at your post for E-4. But I would like to say that if you can please try to be formal when giving tips and advice on how to play the map if you can. While I know you were trying to be helpful, we want to encourage a formal write up on tips. Try to do that next time. If you need to, talk with me and we can look into reviewing what you write up before you post. This might help out.- [[User:Totaku|Totaku]] ([[User talk:Totaku|talk]])  06:21, 22 November 2016 (UTC)
