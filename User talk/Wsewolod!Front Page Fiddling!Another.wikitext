==Grievances==
*"Additional Recipes" is useless in its current state.
*The <nowiki>{{FrontpageData}}</nowiki> is too long; that extent of scrolling isn't very user-friendly. 
*The logos associated with the top row of <nowiki>{{FrontpageData}}</nowiki> are excessively large. 
**[[Exercises (PvP)]] isn't a very significant page, yet it is placed alongside the sortie, expedition, and quest motherpages (just look at the traffic those three receive). Proposal to remove it from there and place it further down in the template.
*Sortie is linked to, in addition to every individual sortie world. Leaving one or the other seems efficient.
*"Wiki Status (Twitter)" is abandoned and has little past activity; no reason to link to it here.

===Insignificant===
*[[Enemy_vessel]]
*[[List_of_equipment_used_by_the_enemy]]
*[[Shop]]
*[[Furniture]]
*[[NPC]]
*[[Servers]]
*[[Easter Eggs]]
*[[Merchandise]] ''(Only because it is so poorly maintained)''
*All of the assorted ship lists; one or two should stay, perhaps?
*[[Equipment_List_(Image)]], ''this isn't very informative''.
