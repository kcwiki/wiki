If you persist in making these pointless, confusing changes to content, at the very least visit our [http://webchat.esper.net/?nick=NamelessShip...&channels=kancollewiki&prompt=1 IRC channel] and clarify why you think these changes are:
#Needed; was the previous content a complete eyesore or lacking vital information?
#Helpful; was some phrasing difficult to read or down-right grammatically erroneous? 
#Neat; does this change improve the layout of a page, table, or block of text?

If you feel I am being unfair towards you, again, you can consult (presumably) more neutral editors in the IRC channel, or can write a message on my discussion page. Be mindful that I correct *all* crappy edits I see; this is not exclusive to you. If you think I'm being lenient towards others, please bring up the errors they have made and I will attend to those. 

This is not KCUSA or the Wikia; it's a wiki with the goal of maximum readability for Kancolle users. Thank you. [[User:Wsewolod|Wsewolod]] ([[User talk:Wsewolod|talk]]) 10:23, 29 July 2015 (UTC)
