Improvements so far:
*Each page-worth of data has its own heading now, so you can edit without ctrl+f
**The ideal is to make every item set (sonars, torpedoes, light main guns, etc.) into its own

To-do:
*Give each ship its own row for availability, as is done on wikiwiki
*Get extremely creative with reducing the article's size. [[User:Wsewolod|Wsewolod]] ([[User talk:Wsewolod|talk]]) 01:42, 10 October 2015 (UTC)
