EchIII, I would like to thank you for your recent edits. However, I would like to request that you please try to refrain from including opinions in your edits, and try to keep edits to factual data. Thank you. [[User:Ravien|<span style="color:#50c878"><font face="Blackadder ITC" size="4"> Ravien</font> </span>]] 06:07, 16 July 2016 (UTC)

EchIII, I notice that you seem to make multiple edits to one document sometimes to fix minor issues with a piece. Do you know that you can click "Show Preview" at the bottom of an edit, and it will allow you to see the edit as it will be placed on the final page, so that you can make edits to fix issues before they become one? It is always a good idea to use preview to test changes instead of making multiple edits when working on a document that is live to the public.
