Actually, the use of a Saiun isn't a matter of opinion, it's very much fact that some ships are advantaged by preventing a Red-T.

You may wish to refer to here to calculate which ships benefit from avoiding a Red-T [http://kancolle-calc.net/suffering.html here]

:I agree with you. The fact of using the Saiun or not wasn't a matter of debate though, and more a matter of the mechanics of Saiun in general. Your comment was a targeted comment at the previous stance, which in effect was a nullification, and wasn't really providing any benefit at that point. My comment of opinions was regarding your extremely strong wording on certain topics, specifically for when you state that something is "required."

:I believe it could be very beneficial if you could add detailed information regarding [[Saiun]] mechanics to either [[Combat#Engagement_Form_Modifier]] or another section of the combat page, where it would be more readily accessible as a global resource. (Also, four tildes "~" will automatically sign any entries you make) [[User:Ravien|<span style="color:#50c878"><font face="Blackadder ITC" size="5"> Ravien</font> </span>]] <font size="2">([[User talk:Ravien|talk]])</font> 07:44, 16 July 2016 (UTC)

 
Sounds good, will add the details to the saiun and combat mechanics page [[User:EchIII|EchIII]] ([[User talk:EchIII|talk]]) 10:54, 16 July 2016 (UTC)

:Thanks. Always good to beef up the details :) [[User:Ravien|<span style="color:#50c878"><font face="Blackadder ITC" size="5"> Ravien</font> </span>]] <font size="2">([[User talk:Ravien|talk]])</font> 19:48, 16 July 2016 (UTC)
