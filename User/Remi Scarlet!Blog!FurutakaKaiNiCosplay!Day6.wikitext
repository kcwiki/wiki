So I'll quickly go over what I did on 5/27/15 since I didn't get a whole lot done. Basically, yesterday was spent clicking around ebay and amazon buying various parts. So things I bought include

*Knee socks
*Thigh highs
*Cotton bodysuit
*Penny loafer shoes
*Pleated blue skirt
*Two 4.1kg-cm rated servo motors

For the servo motors, they have to be able to rotate two barrels that are have two components to them of certain length. The two components have different diameters.

Where <math> a </math> is pipe of diameter 0.5inches and <math> b </math> is pipe of diameter 0.75inches.<br />
''Note that with servo motor ratings, <math>kg</math>⋅<math>cm</math>, it seems that it's just it's torque without the gravity component calculated in. The <math>\tau</math> I use in the calculations isn't actually torque but it's the same idea so I use the symbol for it, even if it's technically incorrect.<br />
<math>CoM</math> is Center of Mass''<br />

|}
<math>\tau_{total} = 0.127kg</math>⋅<math>cm + 0.558kg</math>⋅<math>cm = 0.785kg</math>⋅<math>cm</math>

And since I have two of these barrels, I needed a servo motor with at least a kg⋅cm rating of <math>0.785 * 2 = 1.57kg</math>⋅<math>cm</math>. Since it's always better to err on the side of caution, I decided to just go overkill and get a 4.1kg⋅cm rated servo.

Shoutout to the [https://www.facebook.com/groups/kancolleusa/ Kancolle USA group] because I completely forgot how torque worked. It's been a few years kek. And to think I was originally a mechanical engineering major a long time ago.

That said, let's move onto what I actually did today.

===5/28===
So today, I decided to ''actually'' start working on the cannons since I'd been delaying them for a few days now. That said, I didn't really plan too much out other than some basic goals for dimensions. I aimed for about a 12in x 4.5in x 7.5in frame for the body and so I decided to go ahead and run with that. Images will likely serve as better explanation so I'll do that gallery thing again with explanations for the images in the annotation. Again, feel free to look through my [http://imgur.com/a/PEyTY Imgur Album] for easier viewing of images.
