===Event Description===
[[Image:Sp2015PreText.png]]

'''It's important to sortie to the regular maps too!'''

The Spring Event: Time-Limited Map "Order! Operation No. 11" has started. It's important to have some levels on your ship girls along with decent equipment and stockpile of resources while deploying to the Time-Limited Map!<br>
Admirals who have come onboard only recently should not immediately enter the event map and should first round out your fleet and increase the experience of your fleet. Only after you have done sufficient preparation should you enter the event map!

Those admirals with high HQ Levels will be able to select the difficulty of operations just like the previous event. Admirals confident in their preparations should definitely try the normal difficulty. In addition, admirals with high HQ Level will also be able to choose the hardest difficulty.

*You can change the difficulty, but the map gauge will completely recover.
*New ship girls rewarded as bonus for clearing operations will be available regardless of difficulty chosen.

'''Preparation for Operation No.11'''

Admiral, the order for "Operation No. 11" has been given!<br>
Prior to the start of the operation, we will perform reconnaissance of the operational area with a small yet speedy fleet in order to assess enemy forces.
Form a torpedo squadron with light cruisers and destroyers, deploy them to the Curry Ocean, and perform recon operations!

'''Second Curry Ocean Operation'''

Admiral, we have succeeded at the reconnaisance using the vanguard fleet.<br/>
We shall now deploy a combined fleet with the main force.<br/>
Form a "Combined Fleet" of either a Carrier Task Force or Surface Task Force, deploy to the operational area in the Curry Ocean, and gain the control of the sea region.<br/>
Second Curry Ocean Operation, combined fleet, deploy!

On the composition screen, drag-and-drop the icon of 2nd fleet on to the icon of the first fleet and form a <span style="color:red"><u>[[Combined Fleet]]</u></span>, deploy it, and carry out the Second Curry Ocean Operation!<br/>
''Note: The route taken by Carrier Task Force and Surface Task Force will be different.''

'''Bagel Bay Transport Destruction Battle'''

We are carrying out the secondary operation of Operation No. 11.<br/>
To prepare for the main operation, form an effective, powerful fleet made of ships that aren't large, main-force ships (slow speed large battleships and regular aircraft carriers) and deploy to the Bagel Bay.<br/>
Eliminate the enemy surface fleet, find the enemy transport fleets in the area, and eliminate them.

Form a transport destruction fleet using cruisers and cruising battleships, deploy to the operational area, and <span style="color:red"><u>eliminate the enemy transport fleet</u></span> on the supply line!

'''Ri Lanka Island Capture Operation'''

We are now going to carry out the operation to capture Ri Lanka Island.<br/>
We can't hold the island for long periods of time due to supply lines, but by capturing Ri Lanka Island and holding the harbor for a certain period, we will be able to form a strategic bridgehead for the ocean breakthrough contact operation.<br/>
Operation No.11, combined fleet, deploy!

Form a [[Combined Fleet|<span style="color:red"><u>Combined Fleet</u></span>]], deploy, and carry out the operation to capture Ri Lanka Island!<br/>
''Note: The route taken by Carrier Task Force and Surface Task Force will be different.''<br/>
''Also, ship girl drops will vary largely depend on which node the combat is at.''

'''Attack on Apricot Atoll Anchorage'''

We have succeeded at "Operation No. 11" and captured the Ri Lanka Island, and temporarily suppressed the island. <br/>
Using the harbor of the island, it is possible for us to further expand the operations. We will carry out attacks on enemy's secret harbor discovered during Operation No. 11.

Form a <span style="color:red"><u>fleet consisting of elite ship girls</u></span> and carry out the attack on enemy's atoll harbor hidden away! Be on the lookout for enemy's remaining force and reinforcements!

We have succeeded at the assault on the harbor within the Stevia Sea area. From the Curry Ocean, go through Stevia Sea, and complete the ocean breakthrough contact operation!<br/>
This is the last stage of "Operation No. 11"!<br/>
We are looking forward to each fleet's performance!

Gather all forces, <span style="color:red"><u>form a powerful [[Combined Fleet|<span style="color:red">Combined Fleet</span>]]</u></span>, enter the Stevia Sea, eliminate enemy fleet reinforcements, and complete the ocean breakthrough contact operation!
