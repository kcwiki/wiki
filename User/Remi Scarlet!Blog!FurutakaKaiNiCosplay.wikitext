Well, here goes nothing.

==What The Fuck Is This==
[[File:216_3.png|right|My bae right here.]]


I'll be making these blog posts as I work on my Furutaka Kai Ni cosplay props and whatnot. The posts will be made with my progress, process, description/explanation and some random musings.
Feel free to message me on [http://facebook.com/pingryanime Facebook] if you want to ask me questions about it or shoot me a message on our IRC, #kancollewiki@irc.esper.net. If it weren't obvious enough by my wiki username, my nick on IRC is also Remi_Scarlet. Alternatively, feel free to use the discussion page on this page to talk.

That said...

===Goals and Whatnot===
So obviously with any cosplay, there are a lot of levels of "completion" and whatnot. For this cosplay, I plan on making this one of my most ambitious and difficult cosplays to date. Some things I plan on incorporating include but are not limited to:
*Rotating and controllable cannons via button input on my hands
*<s>Retracting barrels to emulate the cannons "firing"</s>
*<i>Firing sounds via a miniature speaker system</i> (Maaaaaaybe)
*<s>POSSIBLY fake "smoke" from the barrels upon "firing"</s>

<s>I estimate the total cost for this cosplay to hit possibly in the ~$500 range depending on how fancy I decide to make this. Again, this is by far my largest and most ambitious project yet.
Edit: As of 6/1/15, I have now surpassed over $500 in materials. My wallet is crying horrendously. I don't even know where all the money went. It just evaporated.</s>

Hah. $1,200. Bye.

===Materials===

'''''Foamboard'''''
*This is the type you can buy at any craft store such as [http://www.michaels.com/elmers-acid-free-foam-board-2-count/10390078.html this]. Make sure to buy these in-store because these are hella expensive if you buy online. If you buy a non-brand one like Elmer's from your local craft store, you can get these for even cheaper. I get mine for like $4 or $5 per board. I just got a bunch when they were on sale so I paid $3.50 each kek

'''''Cardstock and Poster Paper'''''
*This is essentially just "thicker" paper. Look at my day 1 post and I have a pretty good explanation on what type I buy and how to use these. I utilize the poster paper for larger portions that require reinforced paper like the smoke stack backpack.

'''''Wood of Various Sizes'''''
*I'll buy dowels, square dowels (whatever they're called), boards and various other cuts. Basically whatever I deem necessary.

'''''Paints'''''
*Generally I just buy a shitton of spray paint and some masking/painting/marking/whatever tape to get certain types of paint patterns. More on this whenever I start painting my props.

'''''Glue'''''
*Elmer's glue and wood glue along will be my primary weapons of choice with the occasional assistance from the clear Gorilla glue and some hot glue when the occasion calls for it. I rarely use, but have needed, super glue in the past for small stuff.

'''''PVC'''''
*Lots and Lots and Lots and Lots of PVC. For Furutaka my primary cuts are 0.5inch, 0.75inch, 1inch, 1.25inch and 1.5inch cuts.

'''''Screws, Nuts and Bolts'''''
*I generally stick to various lengths of 1/4th inch screws with plenty of nuts and bolts to accompany. If you go to Home Depot, you can get like a box of 1/4th inch washers for $5 and 1/4th inch nuts for like $10 so I just suggest getting those. They're generally 100-packs. 

'''''Craft Foam and Styrene Sheets'''''
For making some portions like the food/shin armor and the tubings around my leg that hold the crane and torpedo tubing, I utilized craft foam and styrene to mold them. This [http://amethyst-angel.com/armormaking.html Website] has a wonderful tutorial on craft foam and styrene armor-making.

===Tools===
'''''Power drill'''''
*I just bought this for the first time in my cosplay career and HOLY FUCK WHY DID I NOT INVEST $40 INTO A CHEAP ONE. THESE ARE A FUCKING LIFE CHANGER DON'T SKIMP OUT IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT. POWER DRILLS MAKE LIFE 100x EASIER WHEN DRILLING HOLES. Like, I used to hand drill holes by screwing small drillbits and progressively working my way up with thickening diameters and it's take like 5 minutes just to get one hole done... with this magical tool, I can suddenly get a hole in 15 seconds. It's fucking amazing.

'''''Saw'''''
*Get a handsaw, the type that looks like a stubby U with a saw band attached across the two legs.

'''''Wrench and Pliers'''''
*If you don't have these, good fucking luck tightening the screws and nuts lol

'''''Some Source of Heat '''''
*I just use my stove. This is for heat bending PVC.

'''''Vice'''''
*These are so fucking helpful for keeping something in-place while you work on it. You'll notice that I'm using this all the fucking time.

===IMGUR LINK FOR THE IMAGES===

==Notes==
Do keep in mind that everything I do here is simply a blog and the information and any tips provided are done so as-is. Don't blame me if you try doing anything I do and you blow up your house or anything. Though if you do somehow manage to blow your house up trying to reproduce my steps, do tell me because I'd be really curious as to how someone could fuck up that badly lol.

Cosplay props are fun.

==End Result==
Lol it's like 3 months after I finished this but I realized I never uploaded pics on here. Here they are.
