'''Opinion on Kantai Collection Shoujo Ai: '''I'm not a supporter of it and I only ship Admiral x Ship girl pairings. To be honest, I'm actually an ex-yuri fan boy, who was rather obsessed with yuri in the past. That obsession however, brought me more negative than anything good and made me unable to enjoy many different anime shows and games. Perhaps partly due to that, I dislike Kancolle yuri - there is also the fact how lovey-dovey many ship girls are towards the player / admiral, and also the marriage system. I'm just unable to see any ship girl as a lesbian, except Ooi, Yamagumo, maybe Yamashiro and Hiei too, though to be honest, even them I like to think of as bisexual.

'''Base: '''Sukumo Bay (Honestly, I'd prefer if my base was somewhere in Hokkaido. I'm not a fan of heat...)



I am an appreciator of anything I, myself, consider cute and / or beautiful. That is the main essence for my enthusiasm towards many aspects of modern Japanese culture, and the main reason why I am today here as a proud admiral, in this wikia. Obviously, there are many other peculiarities inside modern Japanese culture I highly enjoy, such as how crazy Japanese media or in particular the anime / manga / game culture is. Where else do you find a tsundere high school girl who shoots at her crush with a rocket launcher and a minigun? Where else do you find thousand year-old little girl drunkards with supernatural powers? Where else do you find a Neo-Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon? Nowhere else, and that is one of the reasons why I love modern Japanese culture.


If you are the type to enjoy reading character profiles, take a look below: I've listed my personal fleets and written comments of each ship girl from the perspective of an ''almost ''all-knowing narrator, who also gives out opinions. (Note: the comments regarding ship girls and their behaviour and such are based on how they are/would be in ''my ''fleet. What is written here is not necessarily an universal truth, so don't take what I've written ''too ''seriously.) (WORK IN PROGRESS)

|Flagship of the first destroyer division. Has received training in leading others from the admiral personally, and is a good leader, although she has been a bit overconfident at times. This overconfidence has not always lead to good results, which she is now wary of. She works hard for her admiral's and allies' sake in the role of one of the most important ships in the navy.
|She lacks in common sense and has a habit of playfully running around by herself, but her combat potential and morale is very high. Has shown high admiration for the admiral and proven herself to be reliable, despite her short-comings which she herself doesn't even realize. It'd be good if she became more aware of her actions and behaviour - while it is part of her charm, she has difficulty making friends with other ship girls due to her unsocial attitude towards them.
| style="height: 90px;"|A girl possessing incredible beauty, she is the newest member of the first destroyer division. While she has proven to be able to perform well in all kinds of combat situtations, she lacks the level of combat experience the others have. Generally, she is a level-headed person who has a good judgemental ability, but she is the type to easily be embarrassed by praise and affection shown towards her, which makes her very adorable. She tries to keep Shimakaze in-check, with little success.
|While not as offensively strong as Yuudachi, Shigure is composed and has good judgement. She is able to outclass Yuudachi at times thanks to her Cut-In attacks. She is surprisingly laid back when off-duty, knowing just how to relax and enjoy her free time. Despite her continuous habit of talking about rain, she has a fairly bright personality - one would think she'd have a more darker personality...
|The "trump card" of the fleet. Befitting her flashy appearance, she has a ridiculous strength and combat potential. However, she is very playful and kind of slow, at times. In the head, I mean. Still, she is very adorable and spending free time playing or just simply lazing around with her is the ultimate happiness.
|Although she has tsundere tendencies, she actually has the most common sense in the division, so she is a good advisor. She is prone to get too heated in an actual battle and outside of it too, however... She has a habit of speaking archaically in battle, which when combined with her beautiful and pure appearance, manages to give a surprisingly fearsome aura...

|Flagship of the second destroyer division. Takes her role as the leader very seriously and does her best to keep everyone safe. However, she doesn't show this openly and uses harsh words towards everyone, including other ship girls. In the words of admiral Nep-Nep, despite her hard outer shell, Akebono is actually a big softy on the inside. <3 (Don't let Akebono hear that though...)
|Beautiful and petite girl, who is quite playful in an adult-kind of way... She has often tried seducing her admiral - whether it is just plain teasing or an attempt to get closer to the admiral remains unknown. What is sure, is that she is devilishly attractive... Her combat performance is not that high, but she gets her job done.
|She doesn't specialize in any specific area, but she is hard-working and cares for the admiral and fleet girls a lot, and works very hard for their sake. With her happy nature, she brings an instant morale boost to everyone she is working with. She is one of the best cooks in the whole navy.
|The most experienced ship girl in the fleet, she covers for everyone in the shadows, trying to keep them safe. Extremely hard-working, serious and good in combat, but has an odd sense of humour and occasional behaviour in heavy contrast to her usual serious self.

|"Yasen Baka" a.k.a the night battle idiot is the flagship of the first cruiser division. She is a loveable idiot, but her combat performance is amazing and very inspiring. However, having an idiot as the leader may not be a good idea. An idiot leader makes the whole fleet an idiotic one, and that doesn't sound very smart...
|She is... well... mildly idiotic, but very loveable all the same. Her combat potential is high, but she has a bad habit of being too familiar with the enemy, and her coordination with other ship girls is rather bad. She may even start singing during battle... She is cute though.
| style="width: 90px;"|Mikuma is... not an idiot... maybe? Her formal speech gives her an air of an "ojou-sama", but her appearance and occasional cute, yet strange verbal tics are in heavy contradiction with her normal speaking style. Performs well in combat and is able to use seaplane bombers.
|Gentle and sweet girl, she is even comparable to an angel. However, she knows when and how to fire at the enemy, and her combat performance is very high. Has good judgement, intuition and is fairly composed, but she is not the type to lead others. Has the second-most common sense in the fleet.
|Shy, but incredibly gentle and sweet. One might think she'd be bad at combat, and perhaps she is, but her battle strength is tremendous. Does that strength come from the desire to protect the admiral and other ship girls? She doesn't have a good composure and thus, is not fit for a leader, but she is not an idiot.
|Adorable ship girl from western origins, she is very strong in battle and is blessed by the lady fortune. However, she lacks common sense and is kind of slow at times. Also prone to daydreaming. There is not a single ship girl in this adorable fleet of idiots fit for leading the fleet, but they still manage to get their job done reliably.

She appears to be quite bothered by this, but she holds her position with pride.
|Her cheerful and playful, yet mature personality makes her a pleasant person to deal with. She is prone to teasing the admiral, however. (The admiral '''is '''quite the easy one to tease...) While her overall amount of experience is not that high, she has participicated in many difficult battles and proven herself reliable.
|"...Thy eyes shalt not find peace upon gazing on women's bosom, nor bottom. In Choukai's midriff one's eyes findeth salvation"... these were the wise words of an admiral from a mysterious, unknown age, what admiral Nep-Nep found himself agreeing on, to some degree.
|A military otaku, her interests are a great asset to the navy... Unfortunately, her admiral doesn't show much interest in that area... what kind of a shitty admiral is he? However, Yuubari is greatly valued in the navy and has been given free hands in whatever development she wants to do. She is still inexperienced in combat, but is receiving training.

Prideful and hot-blooded, yet not without some childlish traits, she is a great inspiration to all. Matters of mind should be left for someone else...
|The opposite of her sister ship Kumano in many different ways. She is a carefree girl, not one to bother with formalities and the like. As a result, it is very easy to get along with her, but for an introvert her social personality might be a bit overwhelming at first. Her combat experience is not that high, but she gets her job done reliably.
|A ship girl who values proper etiquette and beauty, or just simply elegance when put into a single term. She does appear to be elegant most of the time, but she is not completely without flaws. These flaws, however, only make her more cuter. She is highly experienced in battle and among the top 5 ship girls who can keep the admiral in check the best.
|A cheerful and incredibly sweet girl, she seems to admire the admiral a lot. Unfortunately, her feelings are not always noticed by the admiral who works with many other ship girls daily. Even though she is still inexperienced, she works hard with warm feelings and has no particular faults in any side of the field.
|
Adorable light cruiser with a weird, but cute verbal tic what admiral Nep-Nep seems to enjoy copying like an idiot... Her service history is not that large, but she is determined and possesses great strength. Her strength serves as an inspiration to all, but no one should be copying her behaviour, even if it is cute... She has the largest Ahoge of all.
|Possessing a calm, mature personality and a good judgement, she is the true brains of the division. While she is, for the most part, very serious and hard-working, she does have a surprisingly playful side to herself too. She is fairly young as a warship, but she has many achievements under her name in admiral Nep-Nep's navy.

She tends to overpraise herself, but usually deservedly so. She is most likely a heterosexual.
|As a torpedo cruiser, she possessess great strength. However, her personality is a bit difficult, perhaps even frightening at times... She has an unhealthy obsession on her sister, a rebellious attitude, an uncomfortably deep enjoyment of battle... However, her admiral seems to trust her, at least somewhat. She is Kitakami-sexual, possibly a little bit bisexual too...

|A ship girl from western origins and flagship of the fast battleship division, she has been taught to value order and discipline. However, after arriving to admiral Nep-Nep's fleet, she has learned to take things less seriously. She has an adorable, childish side to her too, which most often shows in the way of her looking for praise or acknowledgement from others. All the praise she receives is well-deserved as one of the most reliable ships in the navy. She has shown this childish side more often recently.
|Currently the most experienced battleship in the navy, she highly admires the admiral and works hard for a better tomorrow for his sake. She is the kind of person who always puts others before herself, which is kind of worrying, honestly. She is fairly calm in duty and has a good judgement, but she can be kind of clumsy at times, especially when off-duty.
|The one who has conquered the hearts of many admirals with her innocent and cheerful, yet bewitching charm, but she has not quite managed to do so to admiral Nep-Nep yet. She is hard-working and reliable, even though perhaps a bit silly and hyperactive at times, but it is all part of her charm. Most likely, she has earned a place in the admiral's heart, but there are many other tough competitors...

Flagship of the heavy battleship division, she is the true "yamato nadeshiko" of the whole navy. Really, she is just simply perfect. She does have a clumsy side to her, but that makes her even more perfect. In fact, she is almost too perfect...

Her power is tremendous and only to be utilized in the most difficult operations, which leaves her with a lot of pressure. However, even though she is easily flustered off-duty, she is the type to perform well under stress, which together with her mind, charisma and strength makes her a fitting leader.
|The more masculine part of the Yamato-class, her immense battle strength and combativeness serves as an inspiration to all ship girls. Watching her battle is a truly fearsome sight, enough to make even her admiral feel shivers in his spine (not that it is a difficult thing to do towards admiral Nep-Nep). However, she has a warm heart and shows extreme kindness towards her allies. It seems that both, Yamato and Musashi are idolized by some of the ship girls, and it is a small wonder why. She too is a good leader - Those glasses are not just for show!
|
Her combat strength is not in such tremendous levels such as Yamato's and Musashi's, but Mutsu's strength is fairly respectable in her own right. She is generally used as a reserve more often than the Yamato-class, and has proven herself reliable.

She has a sultry aura - it is not just that her appearance is attractive, but her behaviour too has an enthralling, feminine charm to it...

|A ship girl originating from the army, she has a different cultural background than most other fleet girls. She performs her duty with an old-fashioned, formal attitude, which is in heavy contrast to the normal, light-hearted atmosphere in the navy. This atmosphere has had an effect on her however, and she appears to have developed some weird sense of humour and has come to enjoy many different things in life. She strikes off as an odd person really. Her speciality is landing-based operations.

|The dream of almost all male high school students on the earth, she has a mature, alluring charm to her, accompanied with unique beauty outmatched only by few. She appears to be confident and reliable at almost all times, but she does seem to have a secret, unsure and surprisingly girly side to her. As a non-combat vessel, her duties are of a more supportive nature, but she has the ability to act as both, a leader and an advisor.
