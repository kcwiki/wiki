Hi everyone,

For those that do not know we recently had a poll that was conducted by the community representatives of several major representatives from various '''wikis''' and '''viewers''' that wanted to look into settling the issue since the majority of us were at a standstill due to conflicts between the communities views on what the Kaiboukan should be abbreviated under.

This mainly started with a views between the '''EN KanColle Wiki''' and '''KanColle Wikia''' as we were discussing the appropriate term for them which ultimately led to me decided to go an contact Marluxia who happens to work for the [https://www.history.navy.mil/ Naval History & Heritage Command (NHHC)] who provided us with an impressive insight on the '''Kaiboukan''' and also linked us to an article on Combined Fleets (shown [http://www.combinedfleet.com/Kaibokan.htm here]) which discussed how they officially couldn't be classified as either Destroyer Escorts nor Frigates and were summarized under a category of thier own.

This would ultimately result in having this team gather to try to discuss the whole issue and it was decided the best way to handle the outcome was through a poll. 

The first poll that was conducted was to determine which new abbreviation to apply to the Kaiboukan (With options: EE, E and KB). This was later deemed unfair by the representatives of the community which reasoned that not having a poll with the option most used and accepted by the community, DE, was not correct.

The poll we went with was to determine if the community had a sound opinion on whether or not they wanted to really change out of DE or not.
So the poll was conducted with the choices of: 
DE or Something else (Which would lead to a second poll deciding over the choices of EE, PF, or KB) for the new abbreviation term.

The poll ended in a near stalemate:<br>
'''DE:''' 386 votes, '''Something else:''' 388<br>
The results were debated internally on how we should interpret this and move forward. We initially believed that we would have a clear winner with a decent margin but on hindsight, we did not expect this result - '''a virtual tie.'''
 
2 proposals were made: the first was to run a '''second poll''' but to include '''DE (DE, PF, KB, EE)'''. It was obviously going to be a formality because any sensible person can draw the conclusion with the result of the current poll. 

The other proposal was to declare '''DE the winner''' in view that despite DE losing by 2 votes, it is technically the majority, the winner, because the other 388 votes from "something else" is a combination of options that would have no chance to win against DE when pitted against it one-on-one.

The group are in view that the latter should be the answer and the former pointless, and that we have heard from community that this needed to be over with. 
 
With this, we concluded that we have decided that we would accept '''DE''' as the majority vote and this debate closed.

This will be the stance we will be using to represent the Kaiboukan for the time being.

In the event other escorts appear at some point in the KanColle game that happen to be USN Destroyer Escorts, we may consider reviewing the abbreviation once more.

We thank you for taking the moment to reach this and hope you appriciate our view on the topic since we want to consider putting the community first.

Best Regards,
