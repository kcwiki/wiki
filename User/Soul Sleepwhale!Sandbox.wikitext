;'''Monthly Quest: "Surface Strike Fleet" to the South! (Bm4) Advice:'''
* This quest requires three slow battleships (or BBVs), exactly one light cruiser, and two other ships, with an S-Rank at the boss node.
** Those other two ships should be 2 DD to guarantee boss routing.
*** You can also use 2 ships of any other class though all branches will be random without 2 DD.
