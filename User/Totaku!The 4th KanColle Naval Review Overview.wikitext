Good day to all of you Admirals out there!

As of last night the [[KanColle Naval Review|4th KanColle Naval Review]] has completed it main performance for the day! And the event has been filled with lots of thrilling an entertaining things that unfolded over the course of the show!

For those that wonder what the KanColle Naval Review is, think of it as a special 1-2 day Convention gathering that takes place in Japan where people who buy tickets can go attend the event and purchase rare and exclusive KanColle goods, but at the same time those who buy tickets to the live performance will be able to attend the Seiyuu performance show.

As of this year, a grand total of '''22 Seiyuu''' were present at this live event and there was lots of things that unfolded over the entire show. 

We will be documenting the history of the events that occurred at the live event show regarding the Seiyuus and stuff, but to save time, the news here we will be covering will be related to the game and fanchise related content from the First and Second showing of the live event.

With that, here are the details:

'''First Live Event Show'''

'''1. The New Akizuki-class Destroyer '''Suzutsuki''' has been announced and is expected to appear as of this fall!'''

Picture of her have been shown over the show and it's been noted that she has long silver hair and a side tail and is dressed in the traditional Akizuki-class unifrom, but the noted difference is she dawns a white body suit in comparison to [[Hatsuzuki]]'s Black Body Suit.

'''2. A New Destroyer that will be part of the British Royal Navy has been announced!'''

No detail regarding about if she would appear in the fall event or not though. Her picture would be shown however in the second Live Event show (Which will be covered later.)

3.'''The 2017 Kancolle [[Naval District Saury Festival]] will be beginning next maintenance!'''

It was spoken to by Saki Fujita during her performance with Yuka Iguchi as she temporary turned to the audience and announce to them about this. So please be sure to review your plans for fishing for the upcoming update.

4.''' A New PV for [[KanColle Arcade]] was shown showcasing the Autumn Event'''

The Autumn Event that KC Arcade is going to do will be based off of the [[Spring 2014 Event]], meaning they will be jumping past two events to the next one. In addition, the following ships have been announced in the trailer for the upcoming event: [[Amatsukaze]], [[Taihou]], [[Prinz Eugen]], [[Bismarck]] and much more.

The PV should be released to the public in the following weeks / month to follow.

5. '''The Announcement of KanColle Phase II on it's 5th Anniversary'''

At the very end of the performance a final message has popped up on screen announcing that KanColle is preparing to enter the next stage of it's cycle! Something which had been announced as far back as Early 2013 but was never carried through till now.... and with it comes two major announcements. 

6. '''Phase II will include the moving of KC off of Flash and onto HTML 5. The full migration is to be completed by Spring 2018.'''

One of the most pressing issues with KanColle was the recent news that Flash was officially being discontinued which sparked great concern over the game's future. But with this announcement, it's now known that they have plans to keep the game going far longer than expected, possibly up past 2020 and beyond at this point. All data and contents will be fully transferred in time for the 5th Anniversary. 

7. '''Phase II will also include the long awaited [[Friend Fleet System]]!'''

The one system that has been left in the dark since the game's launch that never got launched will finally get it's long overdue launch 5 years after the game's official release! Many have been wondering what the Friend Fleet System would be about, and now we will be able to see eventually what this system will entail. 

'''Second Performance Notes'''

8. '''The Face of the British Destroyer was shown!'''

Late in the show, they showed off the picture of [[Warspite]] and [[Ark Royal]] which was showcased as part of the live event promotional material, but then extended the scene to reveal the face of the '''British Destroyer''' Girl. She has been noted to have long blond hair, a sailor hat, a white dress and what looked like a blue coat on her.

9. '''Official Cosplay Fashion Show'''

As announced in a previous twitter not too long ago, KanColle is preparing a line of official cosplay materials that will be released to people to purchase. The Admiral's uniform was announce prior to the show, but now other uniforms that have been revealed included the Fubuki-class Uniform, Mutski-class Unifrom, Shiratsuyu-class Uniform, Kashima's Uniform just to name a few. These were show cases in the same fashion as a Fashion Catwalk show.

That should cover the main news, the rest of the details will be covered in the [[KanColle Naval Review]] page. 

Until then, keep your eyes open as we set sail into the Dawn Horizon!
