Hello, I'm Hand(fun)gun!

I actually wanted the username Nodocchi, but it was already taken. :C

"That lolicon" Who did finally get Shimakaze...at Tlevel 73. Damn.

Palau is muh server, currently grinding for marshal admiral, rank 105. I've been around quite a while, since Fall 2013. Can't be bothered grinding -5 maps for XP since everyone on my server is a no life nerd anyways.

Other games i'm on are LoL, EVE, Tera, and on occaison you may even find me on a Gal/Eroge or 2.

Married Taihou, Bep, Poi, Kongou, Bismarck. Waiting on Eugen, Amatsukaze, Hachi, and Yamato for 99.

18 ships level 99 as of now.
