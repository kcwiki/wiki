Inexperienced Admiral but learning the ropes thanks to DarkHeron's help for the past two years. First full event clear was the Fall 2019 event but had been attempting events dating back to Early Fall 2018. Currently serves as a historical consultant and reviews pages for historical references. Though currently still learning slowly he now has two Kouhai that he teaches the ways of KC to as well now.
