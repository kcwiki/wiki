Hello! My name is Jeane and I've started playing Kancolle around late August. A friend of mine kinda pushed me to play it and ever since then I've been completely hooked.

I don't really like conversing with others since I feel like I'll end up saying something stupid. Do not mind me.

[★ I'm mainly interested in Touhou, Homestuck, Dangan Ronpa, Mogeko/Okegom/Deep Sea Prisoner, Kancolle, Ace Attorney, Umineko and Madoka Magica.

[★] Games I've played before: Elsword, Grand Chase, LaTale, zOMG and all the windows Touhou games.

[★] I'm not very knowledgeable about history. I just play for the cute and adorable girls with huge weapons. Nothing is wrong with that, right?

Thank you for visiting my profile.
