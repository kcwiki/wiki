'''Event Summary:'''

'''Summer 2014''' 

I've only accomplished E-2. Well, can't help it, lacking CV that time.

'''Fall 2014'''

Get Tokitsukaze and Nagato, couldn't get Hayashimo and Kiyoshimo though.

KTKM cut-in save me on E4.

'''Winter 2015'''

Get Agano, Amatsukaze, Naganami, Zuihou, Taigei, Uzuki, Yamagumo, Hayashimo and Kiyoshimo as drops. 

Cleared E4-E5 on easy mode. I hate E5 preboss node. 

I'm happy that Isokaze become obtainable, but i couldn't save her due to several reason. Sorry Isokaze, it's a good bye for now. Next event I'll definitely save you!
