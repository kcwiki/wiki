==Triva==
*I'm the top fan of Mixels and Kancolle!
*In that case, I'm a very good(not grate) at RPing (role play) a little bit.
*I'm a bit too shy and I'm not impressive grammar which I can(or can't) speak in Filipino, English, and every language
* I got a strange about The Lingo Show (from CBeebies), since I saw this in May 2012.
*I'm the most very talent artist, you can see here in my galleries.
**Anyway, check out my Mixels drawings at the Mixels Wiki.
*I hate when you're suppose to mad me in chat.
*I don't have that Kancolle game, because it's too hard to download them. And I hate when there is available in other country.
