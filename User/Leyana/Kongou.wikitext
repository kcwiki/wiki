'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''
* She has accuracy bonuses and penalties when equipped with certain large guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Use Cases===
* Along with her sisters, she is a very important fast battleship for new players. Her low Kai Ni level and remodel cost means that you will be using her for speed restricted maps unless you possess event-only or LSC-only fast battleships.
* Her AACI is weak with a low shootdown and multiplier. The high API number means it will also overwrite nearly all other AACI in the fleet if it triggers. Therefore, it is '''not recommended''' to run her AACI.

===Important Info===
* Required for unlocking the 4th fleet slot.
* Required for quests A15 and A40

==Trivia==
*She is named after [[:wikipedia:Mount_Kong%C5%8D|Mount Kongou]] which translates to "indestructible".
*The radar wings that she and her sisters wear share a similar coloration and design to the alternative name for "金剛" which also means "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajra vajra]", but may be more accurately "ghanta" (bells). [http://drilbudorje.tripod.com/_Dorje.htm See this page] (scroll to 12th Century) and compare to the CG artwork.
*She was the last IJN capital ship to be built by a foreign country.
**Her affinity for tea is based on her British heritage.
*She was the only Japanese battleship sunk by submarine in the Second World War, and the last battleship sunk by submarine in history.
*She received her Kai Ni on November 1, 2013.
*She is still an existing JDS name as of present, along with ''[[Kirishima]]''.

===Appearances in derivative works=== 
*Kongou appears in the anime adaptation of Kantai Collection, and was also featured in the adaptation's [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABZN292gvRo first trailer]. She played a big role in it, as she appears to be the only member of the Fifth Mobile Fleet Fubuki can get along with.
*Kongou appears as one of the main characters in ''[[Print media#side:Kongou|side:Kongou]]''.
*Kongou - along with other ships voiced by Nao Touyama - was featured in the first KanColle Drama CD, titled "Hiei's Curry" (比叡、カレーを作る). Due to one seiyuu doing all the voices, the CD's short story is also referred to as "One Nao Show". A translated version of the short story can be found [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H71UmCq3lWc here]. <!-- An earlier revision also had this: https://soundcloud.com/masapusan/one-nao-show -->
