'''Akagi''' is an aircraft carrier and the sole member of her class. Originally laid down as the second of the Amagi-class battlecruisers, she was converted to an aircraft carrier while still under construction, thus explaining her high durability for an aircraft carrier. She is often paired with [[Kaga]] for their similar history and stats.

Aircraft carriers are best used for achieving [[Aerial_Combat|air superiority]], enabling surface ships to utilize [[Combat/Artillery_Spotting|special attacks such as double attacks or cut-ins]] while preventing the enemy fleet from doing so. In addition to ensuring air superiority, carriers can also take part in battle by equipping them with [[List_of_Dive_Bombers_by_stats|dive bombers]], [[List_of_Torpedo_Bombers_by_stats|torpedo bombers]] or [[List_of_Aircraft_by_stats_(Jets)|jet fighter-bombers]], which also enables the carrier to attack during the opening air combat phase.

Aircraft carriers have a fixed amount of planes assigned per equipment slot. Equipping planes should be dynamically adjusted in anticipation of the maps they are to be sent to. If the map has no enemy air presence then one may consider sortieing a carrier with mostly bomber planes. Should the map have a mediocre enemy air presence such as light carriers it is advisable to equip enough [[List_of_Fighters_by_stats|fighters]] to ensure your own fleet gains [[Aerial_Combat#Fighter_Combat|air superiority.]] Once in the face of significantly heavy enemy air presence one may even resort to equipping a carrier solely with fighters, preventing your carrier from attacking but ensuring that the enemy does not gain an advantage over yours with double attacks or cut-ins. A situation like this is however, very rare, and is usually remedied by sortieing with two carriers equipped with fighters and bombers.

The smallest slot, typically the fourth slot, is usually reserved for an [[List_of_Aircraft_by_stats_(other)|utility aircraft]] such as a [[Saiun]] to prevent the [[Combat#Engagement_Form_Modifier| Red-T disadvantage]] or a [[Type_2_Recon_Aircraft|T2 Recon Aircaft]] for increasing the [[Aerial_Combat#Contact_Damage_Modifier|accuracy and damage of the air squadron.]] Typically the Saiun is equipped in the smallest aircraft slot of the entire fleet, since only one is required to prevent the Red T-disadvantage, and should often be equipped on a [[List_of_light_aircraft_carriers_by_upgraded_maximum_stats|Light Carrier]] rather than a [[List_of_fleet_standard_aircraft_carriers_by_upgraded_maximum_stats|Standard Carrier]] if both types happen to be in the same fleet, otherwise it is advised to examine each individual ship accordingly and select the carrier with the slot that has the smallest aircraft capacity for the Saiun.

Akagi is typically deployed into maps with enemy aircraft carriers. She is best sorited alongside larger ships such as [[List_of_heavy_cruisers_by_upgraded_maximum_stats|Heavy Cruisers]] or [[List_of_battleships_by_upgraded_maximum_stats|Battleships,]] since these ships benefit greatly from the air superiority because they gain access to artillery spotting due to their seaplanes conducting the artillery spotting is not being denied air space by enemy fighters. Akagi is typically sortied with [[Kaga]] in order to allow her to carry less fighter planes and more bombers on herself, spreading the required fighter planes between the two carriers.

==Service History==
''{{Main|Wikipedia:Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|l1=Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi in Wikipedia}}''

Akagi (Japanese: 赤城 "Red Castle") was an aircraft carrier built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), named after Mount Akagi in present-day Gunma Prefecture. Though she was laid down as an Amagi-class battlecruiser, Akagi was converted to an aircraft carrier while still under construction to comply with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. The ship was rebuilt from 1935 to 1938 with her original three flight decks consolidated into a single enlarged flight deck and an island superstructure. The second Japanese aircraft carrier to enter service, and the first large or "fleet" carrier, Akagi figured prominently in the development of the IJN's new carrier striking force doctrine that grouped carriers together, concentrating their air power. This doctrine enabled Japan to attain its strategic goals during the early stages of the Pacific War from December 1941 until mid-1942.

Akagi's aircraft served in the Second Sino-Japanese War in the late 1930s. Upon the formation of the First Air Fleet or Kido Butai (Striking Force) in early 1941, she became its flagship, and remained so for the duration of her service. With other fleet carriers, she took part in the Attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and the invasion of Rabaul in the Southwest Pacific in January 1942. The following month, her aircraft bombed Darwin, Australia, and assisted in the conquest of the Dutch East Indies. In March and April 1942, Akagi's aircraft helped sink a British heavy cruiser and an Australian destroyer in the Indian Ocean Raid.

After a brief refit, Akagi and three other fleet carriers of the Kido Butai participated in the Battle of Midway in June 1942. After bombarding American forces on the atoll, Akagi and the other carriers were attacked by aircraft from Midway and the carriers Enterprise, Hornet, and Yorktown. Dive bombers from Enterprise severely damaged Akagi. When it became obvious she could not be saved, she was scuttled by Japanese destroyers to prevent her from falling into enemy hands. The loss of Akagi and three other IJN carriers at Midway was a crucial strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to the Allies' ultimate victory in the Pacific.

==Trivia==
*Originally designed as an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amagi-class_battlecruiser ''Amagi''-class Battlecruiser], ''Akagi'' was converted into a carrier after the instigation of the Washington Naval Treaty in 1921.
**She was the first Fleet Carrier commissioned by Japan. (''Kaga'' was launched before ''Akagi'', but was commissioned after her).
*Popularly nicknamed the "Queen of Bauxite" due to her reputation for eating up all the Bauxite reserves in your inventory. Despite her rarity she is fairly accessible via a quest in the early levels, as a result, many newer players are shocked at her Bauxite-binging and long repair times.
**There is another explanation for the "Bauxite Queen" title, as during the earlier days of the game, a bug made Akagi consume lots of bauxite at each sortie, but that has been fixed since then.
*She is required for [[Quests#A19|quest A19]].
