This page is designated as a temporary place holder for the following broken page [[Construction Corps]]
[[File:Item_Card_Construction_Corps.png|150px|right]]

==Overview==
Also known as "Construction Team" or "bulldozers", those items are obtained through quests and the item shop, and are used for [[Land-Based Air Squadron|LBAS]] unlocking and upgrading.

==Uses==
Bulldozers are currently used for 2 LBAS related upgrades :
*They are needed for unlocking the [[world 6]] land bases
**In order to use the LBAS at World 6, you first need to complete the quest [[Quests#F43|F43]].
**Each bulldozer will open one LBAS in this world, so you need up to 3 bulldozers 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in 
**The need to open the 3rd LBAS is arguable, for more info, read: [[Land-Based_Air_Squadron#Troubleshooting|Troubleshooting]] 
*For upgrading LBAS groups from each world (events and world 6 for now, and worlds 7 and 5 soon) from level 0 to 3, using the [[Land-Based_Air_Squadron#Land_Base_Maintenance_menu|Land Base Maintenance menu]].

==Acquisition==
One way to obtain bulldozers is via the '''[[Shop|item shop]]''', where you can buy them for 800 DMM points each.

The other way to obtain them is via quests, where up to 4 can be obtained with '''One-time quests''', and then up to 2 can be obtained via '''Yearly quests'''.

The One-time quests are the following :
