==Friend Fleet==
===Fleet Formations===
Friend Fleets will now come with a new function which will allow players to choose if they wish to bring in a Friend Fleet to aid them in battle or not. They can also choose to also decide if they want a normal Friend Fleet come aid them in battle or if they wish to use a powerful Friend Fleet that will require the cost of '''6 Instant Constructions''' [[File:Instant_construction-0.jpg]] to allow you call in a more powerful Friend Fleet to aid you into battle. 

If you choose to opt in for the powerful Friend fleet, the '''Instant Constructions''' [[File:Instant_construction-0.jpg]] will not be consumed unless a powerful Friend Fleet appears.

==Mechanics==
===Participation requirements===
*Must have a 75% sortie win ratio.
*Must have 5 empty ship slots for new ships.
*Must have 20 free equipment slots.

===Special Mechanics===
#The difficulty system first used in [[Spring 2015 Event]] returns: you can choose between Operation A ({{lang|ja|甲}}, Hard), Operation B ({{lang|ja|乙}}, Medium), Operation C ({{lang|ja|丙}}, Easy) or Operation D ({{lang|ja|丁}}, Very Easy) .
#*Choosing A or B requires certain HQ Level (HQ Lv 35 for B / 80 for A in Spring 2015 Event).
#*'''An important note''' to all Admirals intending to clear the event on Hard difficulty - further (new) conditions now apply:'''
#**When switching difficulty from ''any other difficulty'' to Hard, the map's debuff mechanism (where applicable) will be reset.
#***Switching between any other difficulties will not reset the debuff mechanism.
#The debuff system from [[Summer 2015 Event]]'s final map, where certain nodes had to be attacked and other conditions fulfilled to reduce boss armor, will return.
<!---# It is possible that a fleet with '''seven''' ships ('''[[Striking Force Fleet]]''') will be allowed to sortie to certain event maps that permit '''single fleet operations'''.
#*The Striking Force '''cannot''' be sortied during exercises or sent on expeditions while it contains seven ships.
#*The Striking Force can only be created and used in the '''third''' fleet in the menu (out of a total of four fleets).
#*A Striking Force with a flagship that carries a new piece of equipment, the '''[[Striking Force Fleet Command Facility]]''', will be able to make use of the new '''Single Ship Evacuation''' mechanic.
#**The new Striking Force Fleet Command Facility will become obtainable and useable via the old [[Fleet Command Facility]] and the '''Action Report'''.
#***Note that the [[Quests#F64|relevant quest]] will consume the [[Fleet Command Facility]] in order to convert it into the new [[Striking Force Fleet Command Facility]].
#**Supplementary information regarding the new [[Striking Force Fleet Command Facility]] and the Single Ship Evacuation it allows when carried by the striking force's flagship:
#***The evacuation does not require an escort destroyer.
#***The evacuation consumes the ship's entire fuel & ammo reserves. 
#***Only one ship can be evacuated per battle.
#***'''The damage the ship suffered may become worse during the evacuation, but she will never sink.'''--->
# Returning this event, the '''Vanguard Formation''' can be used .
#*This formation will organize the fleet such that the 3rd-6th/7th ships protect the Flagship and 2nd Ship of the Fleet.
#**In addition, the formation allows for ships to become more evasive in combat situations, especially with well-trained Destroyer.
#** This formation is also available '''only during the duration of the event.'''
#**The formation will be usable by [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/930623111862435841 both] normal fleets as well as the Striking Force Fleet.
#'''NPC Friend Fleets''' have been introduced into the game.
#* Friend Fleets act as another unit that appears in particular battles to help aid your fleet when attacking the enemy at the start of night battle.
#** NPC Friend Fleets are selected from a randomized preset list of ship.
#** Depending on who you have in your fleet can also influence who will be arrive to aid you in battle.
#'''Enemy Radar Ambush Nodes''' have been introduced into the game.
#* Entering this node will result in your fleet facing off against an enemy fleet that will ambush and attack your fleet 
#** Your Fleet will not be able to fight against the enemy Fleet.
#** By meeting certain conditions, you can evade these nodes.
#[[Repairs#Emergency_Anchorage_Repair|'''Emergency Anchorage Maintenance/Repairs''']] 【緊急泊地修理】
#*Both [[Akashi|Akashi Kai]] and [[Akitsushima|Akitsushima Kai]] will be capable of conducting emergency repairs; however, Akitsushima has more limited capabilities compared to Akashi.
#*See under [[Repairs#Emergency_Anchorage_Repairs|Emergency Anchorage Repairs]] for details.
#[[Land-Based_Air_Squadron#High_Altitude_Air_Raid|'''High-Altitude Abyssal Bombers''']] that are resistant to all types of interceptors other than the new land-based jet interceptors may also return this event.

'''Note: The Following Guide is an early version that has been based on current collected info. Be aware that information is subject to change as more of the maps and information is released.'''

'''Preparations'''

'''Historical Bonuses:'''

Note: Base multiplier stacks multiplicatively with node-specific bonuses, if any.
*8th DesDiv: ([[Asashio]], [[Ooshio]], [[Michishio]], [[Arashio]]): 1.25x (base)
**Node H: 1.45x
**Node J: 1.2x
**Node K: 1.3x
*[[Nagara]] and 21st DesDiv ([[Nenohi]], [[Wakaba]], [[Hatsushimo]]): 1.15x (base)


On this map, you will be using a single fleet that cannot include (F)BB(V),CV(L)(B) and LHA. 8th DesDiv ships have the highest bonus here. '''However, it's not strictly necessary to use them to clear, and you can consider conserving them for later maps instead.'''

The three major factors consider before attempting this map are:
# Do you have any anti-installation equipment? (Type 3 Shell, Anti-Ground Rockets, Mortars, Daihatsu/Ka-Mi Tank, etc.)
# Do you have any Destroyers and Light Cruisers that can equip said equipment?
# Do you have any 8th DesDiv Members ([[Asashio]], [[Ooshio]], [[Michishio]], [[Arashio]]) (preferably Kai Ni, but not required)?

If you said yes to the first 2 questions, you can clear Part 1 of the map using the recommended lighter ship comps listed below. If you said yes to the 8th DesDiv question, you can consider using them here as well, although just 1-2 of them should be more than sufficient for the purposes of clearing this map (it really is that easy).

The alternative heavier composition should not be used at all on Medium difficulty or higher, especially given how many CAs are required for later Main Operation maps. It has been included only for those with no other alternatives.

Support expeditions are not necessary for this map.

'''Part 1: [[Supply Depot Princess]] (HP Bar)'''

Below is a tab which will cover three of the most recommended fleet comps that can be used on this map. These comps can be used across the whole map.

'''Recommended Fleet'''

Total ships needed: 4-6 ships

<tabber>
|-|1DD/CL/CLT ,4 DD Comp=
*Route: '''B-C-E-F-H'''
* You will only face off against one enemy fleet consisting of 3-4 DDs prior to the boss.
*This comp is the strongest, most efficient comp for this map as a whole, although you can omit the CL for the purposes of the Part 1 boss.
**Using a CLT here is not recommended unless you have dupes, or you are playing on Easy or below.
*This comp is ideal if you have at least 2 DD that can equip anti-installation one-shot builds (Type 2 Amphibious Tank, Marine (Type 89 Daihatsu / M4A1 / Toku Daihatsu 11th Regiment), and WG42 / Shipborne Model Type 4 20cm Anti-ground Rocket Launcher / Concentrated variant) to deal maximum damage to the boss) while the other ships can be equipped for taking out PT imps.
|-|4 DD Comp=
*Route: '''B-C-E-F-H'''
* You will only face off against one enemy fleet consisting of 3-4 DDs prior to the boss.
*This comp is perfectly viable for the Part 1 boss, although a CL should be added for the Part 2 boss.
*This comp is ideal if you have at least 2 DD that can equip anti-installation one-shot builds (Type 2 Amphibious Tank, Marine (Type 89 Daihatsu / M4A1 / Toku Daihatsu 11th Regiment), and WG42 / Shipborne Model Type 4 20cm Anti-ground Rocket Launcher / Concentrated variant) to deal maximum damage to the boss) while the other ships can be equipped for taking out PT imps.
|-|1-3CA, 3-5DD Comp=
*Route: '''A-C-E-F-H''' (Easy or Less)
*Route: '''A-C-D-F-H''' (Medium or Higher)
*'''Not''' recommended on Medium difficulty or above. Shiplocking will be very tight for CAs, taking into account later maps.
* This comp is recommended only to players who are relatively new and lack in anti-installation equipment for DDs/CLs, and have no means of gaining access to that equipment in the short run.
* CAs should equip [[Type 3 Shell|Type 3 Shells]] for the bonus against the [[Supply Depot Princess]]. DDs should be equipped to combat PT Imps.
* You will take the same route on Easy or lower, but on higher difficulties, you will face off against a sub fleet and a fleet consisting of heavy ships.
|-|
</tabber>

Once the Part 1 HP bar has been fully depleted, the Part 2 boss will automatically be unlocked.

'''Part 2: Defeat the [[Light Cruiser He-Class]] (HP Bar)'''

*Route: '''A-C-E-F-I-J-K''' (Easy or Less) if using 1 DD/CL/CLT, 4 DD or 4 DD comp
*Route: '''A-C-D-F-I-J-K''' (Normal or Higher) if using CA-based comp

You can reuse your previous fleet for Part 1. All ships should now be equipped with double-attack set-ups (no anti-installation equipment is required for this part, and anti-PT Imp equipment is also not necessary). If using the 4DD fleet above, adding 1CL is helpful.

There is one additional pre-boss node (J) that is not difficult to clear. If you are having difficulty passing, Vanguard formation may be useful. The boss node (K) is not particularly hard to clear either, particularly with historical bonus ships.
*The new Kai variant of the He-Class CL has significantly higher HP and armour, but this should not pose a problem with enough historical bonuses.

|tips = <br> '''Note: The Current Guide is an early version of the guide and some hints may be subject to change as more information comes out with the release of EO maps and other information. Use this guide with caution as it is subject for possible finalization.'''

'''Preparation'''

On this map, there are several ships that will have historical benefits on this map. A good number of them while useful on this map '''could possibly be useful in later maps'''. So be sure to only use ships you can carefully toss in here while doing this map on Normal and Hard Difficulty. In addition, while there is a mechanic to open a shortcut on this map, completing it isn't entirely necessary.

The only main question you need to ask here is the following:

# Are you willing to use some of the following ships such as [[Choukai]], [[Sendai]], [[Yura]], [[Amagiri]], [[Atago]], [[Takao]], [[Kongou]], [[Haruna]] on this map?
# Are you willing to go through with completing a shortcut phase on this map?

If you agree with the first one, carefully consider who you'll use as they may become useful in later maps. If you agree with the 2nd, you will need additional ships to meet shortcut requirements. Plan carefully using your ships on this map.

'''Historical Bonuses'''

Below is a list of the following historical bonuses:

* [[Choukai]], [[Sendai]], [[Yura]], [[Amagiri]] - 1.25x
* [[Kongou]], [[Haruna]], [[Atago]], [[Takao]] - 1.15x
* [[Akagi]], [[Kaga]] - 1.1x
* [[Souryuu]], [[Hiryuu]] - 1.1x

You may be able to use up to 3-4 historical ships here that will likely benefit this map. But once more, '''please carefully weigh your options before doing so.'''

'''Step 1: Deciding your course of action'''

On this map, you can choose to do the following options:

* Go Directly for the [[Heavy Cruiser Princess]]
* Attack Port Darwin (Node A) and defeat the [[Harbor Water Demon]] several times with an A rank to unlock the shortcut (1 times on Easy / Normal, 2 Times on Hard.

Depend on the direction you choose some options will need to be considered, keep in mind however that there it is '''not necessary to do the Node A Shortcut'''

Below we will focus on the shortcut first before engaging in the actual battle. You are welcome to skip and go directly to attacking the [[Heavy Cruiser Princess]].

'''Step 1a: Attack Port Darwin (Node A) and defeat the [[Harbor Water Demon]]'''

*<font color="red">'''Note that it's completely possible to defeat Heavy Cruiser Princess without the need of unlocking extra route. This phase should be done only if your fleet can't finish off the boss in Final Form to take an alternative route to avoid one air raid!'''</font>

* Recommend Fleet: '''2 CA, 1 CL, 2DD, 1 CVL''' (Fast Fleet)
* Path: '''I-F-E-B-D-A'''
* LBAS Recommendation:
**LBAS 1: 1 Land Base Fighter, 3 Land Base Bombers (Distance of 7 Required)

* On this path your fleet will take the shortest route
* Your Fleet will encounter a surface fleet consisting of CLs and DD, Vanguard Formation is recommended.
* Air Nodes will require decent air defense and AACI to pass efficiently. Use your CVL as a fighter mule, and bring a DD that can AACI to help efficiently past these nodes.
*It's recommended to also bring some Anti-Installation equipment, but it's not necessary to use a nuke setup to efficiently kill the enemies in Node A.

[[Harbor Water Demon]] will usually have possibly have an Airfield Princess, 2 DD and 2 Transports. Having an LBAS target this node should make short work of the enemies allowing for your fleet to do extensive damage to the boss. All you will need is 1-2 A ranks to successfully complete the requirements.

Once you successfully complete the requirement you will open a shortcut through nodes '''J-S-P'''

'''Step 1b: Defeat the [[Heavy Cruiser Princess]]'''

<tabber>
|-|2CA(V) 2DD 1CVL 1CL/CLT Comp=
* Path: '''I-J-L-P-Q-R'''
* Standard comp that '''DOES NOT''' go through the shortcut should you decide not to unlock it
* You will encounter 2 Air Attack Nodes and 2 Surface Battle Nodes before reaching the boss
* For the Air Nods, use Diamond formation and have a CVL that's a fighter mule along with AACI DD.
*If you have some of the better planes, a CVL can easily get 110 AP 1 Fighter and 1 Fighter Bomber which you only need at minimum which is considered suitable enough to susive the air attacks. You can then use the other spots for torpedo bombers.
* For the Surface Fleet, use Line Ahead or Vanguard Formation to take out or evade most of the enemies attacks and survive depending on what you bring.
|-|1FBB/CVL 1CLT/CA(V)/CL 4DD=
*Route: '''I-J-S-P-Q-R'''
* Ths comp will allow you to take the shortcut if you completed Step 1a's process.
* A '''Fast Fleet" is required to take this path.
*Going through the shortcut and skipping one air raid node, also enabling second shelling at the boss node for higher chance of disabling the closing torpedo salvo from enemies
***However, your fleet will become very light due to the presence of 4DDs, may cause higher retreat pre-boss
*If you have some of the better planes, a CVL can easily get 110 AP 1 Fighter and 1 Fighter Bomber which you only need at minimum which is considered suitable enough to susive the air attacks. You can then use the other spots for torpedo bombers.
* For the Surface Fleet, use Line Ahead or Vanguard Formation to take out or evade most of the enemies attacks and survive depending on what you bring.

</tabber>

'''Recommended LBAS'''
*'''4 Land Base Bombers''' (Range 6 Required)

The [[Heavy Cruiser Princess]] will be of a weaker variant that will consist of some CLs and DDs in her fleet. She will not have any airpower therefore allowing your fleet to get an easy AS if you bring a carrier with some fighter power. In addition to this, you can use an all bomber LBAS group to swiftly take out the majority of the enemy fleet so your fleet can focus more on the Princess.

The most effective way to win is to either have a DD that can TCI or use a ship with historical bonuses such as [[Atago]], [[Takao]], and [[Sendai]] who are most effective against the Princess with a double attack on this map. Bringing night battle gear such as a Night scout and star shells will also improve your win rate. Whichever method you choose you can make short work of her and eventually you will clear the map with little effort.

'''Preperation'''

This map will give present the first Combined Fleet Battle for this event. While you are free to go about choosing how to approach this map, the most effecitive way to take care of this map will use either Transport Combined Fleet or a Surface Task Force to tackle the battle. 

Since this battle will serve as the Battle of the Java Sea. Ship affiliated with the battle from history will be most benifical in this map. Since there was a large number of ships the partook in the battle, there will be way more than enough options to select from this campaign. However it is still important to '''Choose Wisely on who to bring as others may become important for later maps''' 

In addition to this, '''depending on the ships you may have a possible serires of options you can consider for this map that you can choose.'''

Below are the following options you should consider before partaking in this map if you plan to do Normal or above:


#Do you have an Oiler you are willing to place within this map?
#* If yes, do you want to use battleships on this map to conserve some Heavy Cruisers?
#If no, are you willing to use [[Akitsushima]] on this map?
#* If yes, do you want to take advantage of a shorter route to get fuel and (optionally) repair ships?

If you reached an agreement, with the Oiler question, you can take advantage of a route that will allow you to use up to 2 larger ships on this map and still take the most effective routing.

If you said yes, to [[Akitsushima]], you can consider using her to take advantage of fuel hoarding if you lack in an oiler to do the job. But you will need to have a 2nd AV handy for later steps.

Depending on how you answer will decide what pathing route you can take.

'''Historical Bonuses'''

Since thie battle takes place as part of the Battle of the Java Sea. A large number of ships will be useful for here but as a reminder, '''choose wisely on who to bring as others may become important for later maps'''.

'''1.1x bonus'''

[[Chitose]], [[Mizuho]], [[Myoukou]], [[Naka]], [[Yuudachi]], [[Ikazuchi]]. [[Inazuma]], [[Minegumo]], [[Samidare]], [[Harusame]]

'''1.2x Bonus'''

[[Ashigara]], [[Haguro]], [[Nachi]], [[Jintsuu]], [[Ryuujou]], [[Yukikaze]], [[Sazanami]], [[Ushio]], [[Amatsukaze]], [[Tokitsukaze]], [[Yamakaze]], [[Kawakaze]], [[Murasame]], [[Matsukaze]].

'''All ship with historical ties will also get a 1.32x bonus at the 2nd boss node (Node O)

'''Step 1: Sink the [[Heavy Cruiser Ne-class]] Kai's fleet'''

In this path, your best methods of tackling this map is to bring either a '''Transport Combined Fleet''' or a '''Surface Task Force'''. Each combined fleet has their own unique path and challenges you'll face along the way toward your first target on the map. Below will be a summary of each comp that makes up each of the combined fleets and what you'll expect from them.

'''Transport Combined Fleet Method'''

'''LBAS Recommendation'''

'''LBAS 1''': '''4 Torpedo Bombers/ Land Base Bombers''' (Range 5 Needed)

At the boss node, you'll face off against the [[Heavy Cruiser Ne-Class|Heavy Cruiser Ne-Class Kai]] along with a group of CLs and DDs in a single Fleet. Depending on the difficulty, you will face enemies ranging all the way up to He-class flagship Kais accompanying the fleet. Having a Land Base full of bombers will make it more convenient wipe out the majority of the enemy fleet making it more possible to concentrate your fire upon the Ne-class. Given that it's armor is also very high, you will need a strong historical ship with TCI available to make it possible to score more wins from it if possible.

If you are able to do this and defeat the Ne-class effectively it should be possible to clear this node with little difficulty. But if you have problems feel free to bring boss support to help you have a better chance at winning against the Ne-class.

Once the Ne-class Kai is sunk, a new path will open to the 2nd boss node which will need to be completed to clear the map.

'''Step 2: Sinking the Battleship Water Demon'''

In this phase, you will be using a '''Surface Task Force''' as it will be the only way you can effectively be able to reach Node O. The enemy's you'll encounter will be the same as before so while the process will be the same, the path you will take will be to the next boss so below we'll review 3 of the most effective comps for the route.

<tabber>
|-|Oiler Comp=
* Composition: ''' 1AO 1(F)BB(V) 1 CVL 3CA(V)/CL + 1CL 4DD 1CAV/CLT'''
* Path: '''C-D-E-G-H-J-L-O'''
* Can bring the strongest possible comp to the boss node.
* You will encounter 2 Submarine Node and 2 Surface Battle
* Bringing 1-2 OASW in the fleet is recommended to improve you success rate against the subs on higher difficulties.
* Surface Battle will consist of CLs, CAs, and DDs.
* Depending on the difficulty, you will need to bring either only a small amount of Air Power or a larger on higher difficulties.
** Casual and Easy will only need 1 plane with fighting power to overpower all nodes.
** Normal will need an air power of 36 to AS or 72 to AS+
** Hard will need an air power of 198 to at least AS
|-|AV Comp=
* Composition: 1AV 3CA(V) 2 CL + 1CL 5DD
* Route: '''C-D-G-J-L-O'''
* You will encounter 1 Submarine Node and 2 Surface Battle
* Bringing 1-2 OASW in the fleet is recommended to improve you success rate against the subs on higher difficulties.
* Surface Battle will consist of CLs, CAs, and DDs.
* Depending on the difficulty, you will need to bring either only a small amount of Air Power or a larger on higher difficulties.
** Casual and Easy will only need 1 plane with fighting power to overpower all nodes.
** Normal will need an air power of 36 to AS or 72 to AS+
** Hard will need an air power of 198 to at least AS
|-|CVL Comp=
* Composition: 1CVL 3CA(V) 2 CL + 1CL 1CA(V) 4DD
* Route: '''C-D-E-J-L-O'''
* You will encounter 2 Submarine Node and 2 Surface Battle
* Bringing 1-2 OASW in the fleet is recommended to improve you success rate against the subs on higher difficulties.
* Surface Battle will consist of CLs, CAs, and DDs.
* Depending on the difficulty, you will need to bring either only a small amount of Air Power or a larger on higher difficulties.
** Casual and Easy will only need 1 plane with fighting power to overpower all nodes.
** Normal will need an air power of 36 to AS or 72 to AS+
** Hard will need an air power of 198 to at least AS.

</tabber>

'''LBAS Recommendation'''

'''LBAS 1''':
* Casual/Easy: '''4 Torpedo Bombers/ Land Base Bombers''' (Range 6 Needed)
* Normal/Hard: '''0-1 Fighter , 3-4 Torpedo Bombers/ Land Base Bombers''' (Range 6 Needed)

At the boss node you'll encounter an enemy combined fleet consisting of a [[Battleship Water Demon]] (on hard mode, she'll start in her "damaged" form). along with a combined fleet consisting of CAs, CLs, and DDs.

In harder difficulties, her composition can include a CVL with high air power and even a Kai He-class flagship among the mix. Your fleet will need to be able to depend on the LBAS and achieving AS to have a chance to defeat the boss fleet. In addition, bringing historical ships will also give you a better chance at success along with bringing in a TCI DD (Preferably [[Ushio]] or [[Yukikaze]] to help wipe out the boss if necessary.

Once the HP bar closes near the end, you will face off against the Kai version of the Princess. Who will be more heavily armored and harder to take down without the assistance of your historicals. As per usual, night battle equipment is important and is necessary, bring a boss suport fleet to give you the edge you need to secure the win to complete the map.

'''Preparation'''

For this map, you will be utilizing ships from the battle of Sunda for this map which will consist of a large group of ships, most which are not all relevant to the Solomon Sea Operations and can be safely used here. You may want to carefully weigh up your options before sending them into this map. In addition to this, you will be using all 3 combined fleets to complete the task this map will challenge you with.

Do note that you can also take advantage of special routing on this map to possibly save on using some Heavy Cruisers (CA) in favor of bringing a Fast Battleship (FBB) and a second Light Carrier (CVL) if you consider using [[Akashi]] or [[Akitsushima]]. Before partaking in the map, consider the following questions:

* Do you have or wish to use [[Akitsushima]] or [[Akashi]] on this map to bring in a stronger fleet?
* Do you have any Fast Battleships you can consider using on this map that are not the Kongou-class?
* Do you plan to use [[Ryuujou]] (if you have her) or conserve her for a later map?
** If you choose to conserve, do you have another CVL to use in her place?
* Do you still have a sizeable amount of CAs remaining in your fleet, approximately 8-10 or more? (You will need at most up to 5 CA(V) for this map)
* Do you have some [[Saiun]]s or Rocket Interceptors to help you get an AS in the Land Base Air Raid Defense node?
* If you answered no to the Rocket Interceptors, can your fighters and Saiun can still successfully achieve the AS requirements (188 for Normal, 512 on Hard)? ''Do remember that your calculated airpower is only 50% of the displayed value with no rocket interceptors.''

If you agreed to the first option, you can consider taking advantage of a route and a way to conserve your CAs toward the EO segment of the event. If you have other FBBs besides the Kongous, consider using one of them to save the Kongou-class for the Solomon campaign. If you have a CVL you can use in place of Ryuujou, consider them over of Ryuujou so you can conserve for a possible historical ship for EOs. Otherwise, if you really need her then consider using her in this map.

Finally, if you have a lower amount of CAs than what is listed, you might want to weigh your options very carefully as you might be forced to lower the difficulty due to your lack of ships. Having a lack of historical ships for certain EO segments may hinder your progress on certain difficulty levels. Plan carefully and decide when it's a good time to drop difficulty.

Finally, if you have a lower amount of CAs than what is listed, you may want to consider weighing your options carefully as you may be forced to lower the difficulty at some point due to lack of ships you may have to EO and more importantly the possible chance that you may lack in historical ships for certain EO segments. Plan your attack carefully and decide when it is a good time to drop in difficulty.

If you do not have rocket interceptors, and can still achieve AS through other means. You can attempt the difficulty level you desire, but if you are struggling, you may need to weigh your options and drop down in difficulty in order to successfully complete the operation. This applies to players especially on Hard mode.
 
'''Historical Bonus'''

Within this operation, many ships associated with the battle of the Sudan Strait will be vital towards completing this operation. However, at the same time many of these ships are also relevant to the Solomon Campaign. While it'll be safe to select some, be careful how many you bring in as they may be relevant to the EOs. Below are the known bonuses that exist on this map:

'''1.1x Bonus'''
* [[Akitsumaru]], [[Yura]], [[Natori]], [[Satsuki]], [[Minazuki]], [[Murakumo]], [[Akatsuki]], [[Hatsuyuki]], [[Shirayuki]], [[Fumizuki]], [[Asakaze]]

'''1.2x Bonus'''
* [[Mogami]], [[Mikuma]] , [[Fubuki]], [[Shikinami]]

'''1.2x Bonus for P and S node (after clearing first gauge)
*[[Ryuujou]], [[Atago]], [[Takao]] and bonus ships only

Out of all the ships present with historical buff, the safest ones you can consider for E-4 include [[Murakumo]], [[Mogami]], [[Mikuma]] , [[Shikinami]], [[Natori]], [[Fumizuki]], [[Satsuki]], and [[Asakaze]] as they have no connection to the Solomons after this map. However you can add in some of the other ships mentioned above in the list as needed or use alternatives, just keep in mind that you need to '''plan carefully who to bring in order to prevent a forced drop in difficulty.'''

'''Step 1: Successfully Complete the Transport Operation'''

The first phase will consist of a transport Operation which you'll need to deplete the transport gauge to complete said operation. You will be using a '''Transport Combined Fleet''' to complete the Objective. For this comp, you will be using a majority of CA(V)/ CLs and DDs. This composition can be summarized in one single comp.

'''Fleet Recommendation'''

'''Transport Combined Fleet: 1 CAV, 1CL/CA(V), 4 DD + 1 CL, 3-4 DD, 1-2 CA(V)'''

'''Path: K-L-M-N-P'''

* Depending on how willing you are to conserve heavy cruisers, you can opt for replacing planned CA with a CL for the main fleet and a DD for the Escort fleet.
* Main Fleet should be armed with as many drums and Daihatsu as possible while maintaining a suitable LOS.
* You will encounter 1 Sub Fleet and 2 Surface Battles.
* It's recommended to have 1-2 OASW ships in your escort fleet.
* Surface fleets will consists of CAs, CLs and DDs. On higher difficulties, they can pose a threat with stronger ships along with their torpedos.
* Node M contain a very strong fleet in higher difficulties which you may need the assistance of a Land Base Air Squadron or even in-route support to help pass this node.
* It's '''highly recommended''' to bring a '''[[Fleet Command Facility]]''' to help prevent yourself from retreating from the map early on if some of your ships take heavy damage.

Most of the battles should be easy to clear if you remember all the mentioned info above. Outside of Node M which may require additional help the rest of the path should be easy.

If the map presents some difficulty, in-route support may help, but isn't entirely necessary.

'''Recommended LBAS'''

*'''LBAS 1: 4 Land Base Bombers'''
*'''LBAS 2: 4 Land Base Bombers'''
** Can consider using them to target '''both on Node P''' or one on '''Node M''' and one on '''Node P'''

The Boss will consist of a [[Heavy Cruiser Ne-class|Heavy Cruiser Ne-class Kai]] along with CLs and DDs. Any Land Base Air Squadron sent there can help wipe out most of the enemy ships here to help you secure an A rank at the very least. The rest should be achievable through your ships and depending on how much transport equips you bring can help you clear the Transport phase more quickly. Remember that you will only need an '''A Rank''' at minimum to deplete the TP gauge. Once the TP gauge is depleted, this part of the operation will be complete and the path for the '''Batativa Princess''' will be open.

'''Step 2: Battle the [[Batavia Princess]] until the final kill'''

In this phase, you will be using a '''Surface Task Force''' to fight against the [[Batavia Princess]] in '''Node S'''. For this phase there are a number of compositions that can come in very handy for how you want to path your way to the boss. Most of these compositions will involve the use of CAs and CLs, unless you decide to use [[Akashi]] or [[Akitsushima]] on this map to take a slightly different route while being able to bring in Fast Battleship and an extra light carrier in your fleet. Below is a list of the composition that players have used that are among the most commonly referred to in this map:

In the list below all comps will face a total of 1 Submarine Node, 2 Surface Battle, and 1 Air Attack.

<tabber>
|-| CA and CL based Comp=
* Composition: '''1-2CL / 2-4CA(V) / 0-2 DD / 1CVL + 1CL / 1-2CA / 0-1CLT / 3DD'''
* Path: '''F-G-J-M-N-R-S'''
* Limit your fleet to 5 CA(V)s within the composition.
* Bringing 1-2 OASW in the fleet is recommended to improve you success rate against the subs on higher difficulties.
* Surface fleets will consists of CAs, CLs and DDs. On higher difficulties, they can pose a threat with stronger ships along with their firepower.
* Since your main fleet will go first, hope they can wipe out the majority of the enemy ships so your escort fleet can survive.
* With a single carrier, it's recommended to have her has decent air power on lower difficulties or go as far as becoming a fighter mule to help improve your chances of surviving the '''Air Attack''' node.
* This comp will also use a large amount of CAs. So please be careful who you lock in this comp if you play on Normal or Hard.

|-|Akitsushima/Akashi Comp=
* Composition: '''[[Akitsushima]] or [[Akashi]] / 1 FBB / 1-2 CVL / 2-3 CA(V) / 0-1 CL + 0-1CVL / 1CL / 3DD / 1-2CA(V)'''
* Path: '''F-G-I-J-M-N-R-S'''
* This comp will allow you to bring a FBB and a 2nd CVL in your fleet, giving your extra carrier power and a 2nd round of shelling for most node along the way.
* If you bring Akitsushima, you can use her as a seaplane fighter mule to allow extra fighter power so you carriers can be more combat focused.
* Bringing 1-2 OASW in the fleet is recommended to improve you success rate against the subs on higher difficulties.
* Surface fleets will consists of CAs, CLs and DDs. On higher difficulties, they can pose a threat with stronger ships along with their firepower.
* Since your main fleet will go first, hope they can wipe out the majority of the enemy ships so your escort fleet can survive.
* This comp works well for effectively saving from using too many CA(V)s in your fleet so you can save some of them for the final operation.
* If desired and you have the proper equipment, you can also consider putting a CVL in escort and arming her with night plane/battle equipment so she can deliver a hard hitting blow in night battle.
|-|
</tabber>

'''Recommended LBAS'''

*'''LBAS 1: 4 Land Base Bombers'''
*'''LBAS 2: 4 Land Base Bombers'''
**LBAS Distance of 7 Required

This will be good up until the final kill which if you're playing on normal or higher, you may need to switch your LBAS around a bit for final kill.

The [[Batavia Princess]] will come in a combined fleet with some Heavy Cruisers, Light Cruisers and Destroyers mixed within the fleet. Hard mode will especially challenge players by having a [[Ne-class Heavy Cruiser|Ne-class Heavy Cruiser Kai]] as part of the main fleet. Using the combination of your LBAS full of bombers and historical ships in your fleet you can wipe out most of the enemy ships without issue leaving only the Princess (and Ne-class Kai on Hard) to be the only main threats in the fleet. Since there is no air power to content with you can take out with your fleet under AS+ with the exception of the final kill on normal and hard. (Please refer to Step 4 of the guide for further explanation). Once you get the [[Batavia Princess]] down to final kill, you will need to make a decision on if you'll complete the debuff process, or proceed to continue attacking the boss until you defeat her as her armor and the threat of her fleet will increase for the final kill. If your playing on Easy or lower, it's quite possible to complete the fight without doing the debuff.

* If you plan to do the debuff please look at the complete guide for Step 3.
* If you plan to just go straight to killing the boss, please skip Step 3 and refer to Step 4.

'''Step 3: Complete the Debuff Process'''

Once the [[Batavia Princess]] is down to her final kill phase you can complete the debuffing phase which will further buff your fleet and weaken the Princess further making it easier to defeat her. To complete this step you will need to complete a series of steps depending on the difficulty listed below.

* '''Hard:''' Score '''2 A+ Ranks''' in '''Node P''', Score an '''S Rank''' on '''Node E''', '''score AS''' in a Land Base Air Raid Defense.
* '''Medium:'''  Score an '''A+ Ranks''' in '''Node P''', Score an '''S Rank''' on '''Node E''', '''score AS''' in a Land Base Air Raid Defense.
* '''Easy:''' Score an '''A+ Ranks''' in '''Node P'''
* '''Casual:''' Score an '''A+ Ranks''' in '''Node P''' ''(pending confirmation}''

Depending on the difficulty, you will likely need to complete these step to get the Debuff to make the princess weaker. At lower difficulties, you can possibly skip the debuff step entirely and just kill the princess from the final step.

Once the debuff is complete, all ships will get a '''1.1x additional buff''' if they attack the '''[[Batavia Princess]]'''.

'''Step 3a: Return with a Transport Combined Fleet [[Heavy Cruiser Ne-class|Heavy Cruiser Ne-Class Kai]] (Node P) for an A rank'''

'''Recommended Fleet:''' '''Transport Combined Fleet: Same as Step 1's composition'''

'''LBAS Setup:''' '''Same as Step 1's set up for both LBAS'''

* You will need to do this process twice on hard, otherwise only once on all other difficulties.

The process of completing this step is the same as doing Step 1. The only difference is that the enemy fleets along the way along with the boss will have improved enemy ships that will make things slightly harder, but otherwise winning these battles should still be about the same way. Remember that you only need to take out 4 enemy ships at the boss node to count as an '''A rank'''.

'''Once the process is completed a chime will play once you return to port and game sounds (SFX) are enabled.'''

'''Step 3b: Defeat the Carrier fleet (Node E) with a Carrier Task Force'''

For this step you will be using your a '''Carrier Task Force''' which will require you to make some changes to your comp along with starting from the starting point from the far east. This part of the debuff requirement will be simple to do and will only need you to reach Node E and eliminate a carrier fleet. Below is the recommended composition:

'''Recommended Composition:''' '''Carrier Task Force - 2 CVL, 2-4 CA(V), 0-2 CL + 1 CL, 3-4 DD, 1-2CA(V)'''

'''Path: A-C-E'''

'''Recommended LBAS'''

*'''LBAS 1: 3-4 Land Base Bombers, 1 Fighter'''
*'''LBAS 2: 4 Land Base Bombers'''

** Distance of 3 (Node C) and Distance of 4 (Node E) or more required.
** Can consider using them to target '''both on Node E''' or one on '''Node C''' and one on '''Node E'''

*'''For Medium and Hard mode only:'''

* You will encounter 2 surface battles along the way
* First battle will be a torpedo squadron, which you may want to send an LBAS to to minimize the chance of your fleet taking damage from the enemy fleets' torpedo strike at the end of the escort fleets' turn.
* Second Battle will have the simple light carriers, with some CAs, CLs and DDs. Use your LBAS to wipe out most of the enemy ships and finish off the rest of the fleet to get the S rank victory you need.

Overall, this step requires you to simply eliminate the enemies on node E. Spreading out your LBAS along C and E is the most effective method. Using this set up and sending LBAS 1 to E and LBAS 2 to C should get you the desired results easily.

'''Once you complete this step, you will hear a chime upon returning to port if game sounds (SFX) are enabled.'''

'''Step 3c: Successfully Protect your Landbase during an enemy Air Raid (Achieve AS)'''

'''Recommended LBAS'''

*'''LBAS 1:''' 2-4 Interceptors, 1-2 Rocket Interceptors or 1 Saiun
*'''LBAS 2:''' 2-4 Interceptors, 1-2 Rocket Interceptors or 1 Saiun

*'''For maximum air defense against high-altitude bombers, you'll need 3 rocket interceptors'''
*'''For Medium and Hard mode only'''

This step can be done at any time during or after Steps 3a and 3b. To be able to get AS you will need most of the stronger incerceptors or well modified interceptors in your land base. If you obtained rocket interceptors from the last event, you can use those to improve your AA vs. the Abyssal Sky Fortresses to make AA more achievable. You should only need 1-2 rocket interceptors minimum.

If for some reason you do not have your rocket interceptors, you can resort to Saiuns to help edge your land base's AA performance towards reaching AS. Although on Hard mode, the only way to achieve AS if you lack in rocket interceptors is to hope you can reach 512+ Air Power and replay the Map until you roll the 3 Airfield Princess composition on Hard to see if you can get AS. It's also important to remember your air power will be cut in half without rocket interceptors, so if you for one reason or another you cannot achieve 512 Air power, you will need to consider '''dropping in difficulty''' unless you want to gamble on trying to defeat the [[Batavia Princess]] without debuffing her which is definitely '''not recommended''' on harder difficulties.

On Medium difficulty, AS should be achievable with all interceptors / fighters in your land base with at least 188 Air Power.

'''Once you complete this step, you will hear a chime upon returning to port if game sounds (SFX) are enabled.'''

'''Step 4: Finish the [[Batavia Princess]]'''

If you have completed all of step 3's requirements, then at this point it is time to proceed with the final kill. If for some reason you chose to skip that, you are still welcome to take the Princess out if you know what your doing or are on a lower difficulty. This part of the guide will focus more on the higher difficulties as most of easy mode can be summarized in the step 2 process since the Princess doesn't change her composition drastically in the final kill. As before, here are the following comps you can consider along with one additional one:
<tabber>
|-| CA and CL based Comp=
* Composition: '''1-2CL / 2-4CA(V) / 0-2 DD / 1CVL + 1CL / 1-2CA / 0-1CLT / 3DD'''
* Path: '''F-G-J-M-N-R-S'''
* Limit your fleet to 5 CA(V)s within the composition.
* Bringing 1-2 OASW in the fleet is recommended to improve your success rate against the subs on higher difficulties.
* Surface fleets will consists of CAs, CLs and DDs. On higher difficulties, they can pose a threat with stronger ships along with their firepower.
* Since your Main Fleet will go first, hope they can wipe out the majority of the enemy ships so your escort fleet can survive.
* With a Single Carrier, it's recommended to make sure she has decent air power on lower difficulties or go as far as becoming a fighter mule to help improve your chances of surviving the '''Air Attack''' node.
* This comp will also use a large amount of CAs, be careful who you lock in this comp if you play on Normal or Hard.
|-|Akitsushima/Akashi Comp=
* Composition: '''[[Akitsushima]] or [[Akashi]] / 1 FBB / 1-2 CVL / 2-3 CA(V) / 0-1 CL + 0-1CVL / 1CL / 3DD / 1-2CA(V)'''
* Path: '''F-G-I-J-M-N-R-S'''
* This comp will allow you to bring a FBB and a second CVL in your fleet, giving your extra carrier power and a second round of shelling for most node along the way.
* If you bring Akitsushima, you can use her as a seaplane fighter mule to allow extra fighter power so you carriers can be more combat focused.
* Bringing 1-2 OASW in the fleet is recommended to improve your success rate against the subs on higher difficulties.
* Surface fleets will consists of CAs, CLs and DDs. On higher difficulties, they can pose a threat with stronger ships along with their firepower.
* Since your Main Fleet will go first, hope they can wipe out the majority of the enemy ships so your escort fleet can survive.
* This comp works well for effectively saving from using too many CA(V)s in your fleet so you can save some of them for the final operation.
* If desired and have the proper equipment, you can also consider putting a CVL in escort and arming her with night plane/battle equipment so she can deliver a hard hitting blow in night battle.
|-|Brute Force Comp=
* Composition: '''AO / 2 BB / (F)BB(V) / CVL / CVL or CA + CL / 2 DD / 2 CAV / CLT or CVL'''
* Path: '''F-G-K-L-M-N-R-S
* This comp will take you along the longest path with lots of battles.
* This is the '''absolute last ditch final resort''' if you do not have the time or patience to tackle the boss through the other methods.
* You will likely be bringing [[Nagato]] and [[Mutsu]] (in their Kai 2 form) as part of this resort. You'll be depending on their special attacks to clear the way.
* You will be bringing an Oiler with 2 [[Maritime Resupply|Underway Replenishments]] to restore the Fuel and Ammo you will be losing over the trip.
* You will go through a total of 2 Sub Battles, 3 Surface Battles, and 1 Air Battle before the boss.
* The main concern from these battles is losing out on Fuel and Ammo over the duration of the trip prior to reaching the boss making the fights harder the deeper you progress into each battle due to the Fuel and Ammo penalty you'll receive.
* At the boss, using the Nagato/Mutsu special attacks can give a possible edge in battle.
* As a reminder: '''DO NOT RESORT TO THIS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE NO CHOICE AS YOU WILL BE LOCKING AWAY CRITICAL SHIPS THAT MAY HELP IN LATER MAPS!!'''
|-|
</tabber>

'''Recommended LBAS'''

*'''LBAS 1: 1 Fighter, 3 Land Base Bombers'''
*'''LBAS 2: 4 Land Base Bombers'''
**Distance of 7 Required

In the final phase, the [[Batavia Princess]] will now have more powerful ships along side of her which will include a Light Carrier on higher difficulties. If you carefully planned your fleet out and bring some good historical ship members in this map then you can easily turn the tides in this battle without resorting to more drastic measures. Using ships like [[Mogami]] and [[Mikuma]] are recommended since this will be the only map they'll be viable for. If you manage to save [[Atago]] and [[Takao]] to use here they can also assist efficiently (but could be relevant for later [TBD]). [[Ryuujou]] (who might also be relevant to EO maps) can also be a possible heavy damage dealer if you arm her with a Night Carrier set up and use her in escort. Other members suchs as [[Natori]],[[Shikinami]] or [[Fubuki]] can also effectively work here (though penitating the princess's armor on final kill on hard may be difficult to achive compared to historical CAs).

Using your combination of historical ships along with the debuff should easily make short work of the princess. But do note that if you play on Hard difficulty, there might be a slight struggle due to the [[Heavy Cruiser Ne-class|Heavy Cruiser Ne-Class Kai]] being a strong meat shield and protecting the [[Batavia Princess]] from most hits. However if the Princess is weak enough a well placed double attack from your CAs is all you'll probably need to win.

It's highly recommended to have a boss support fleet to tackle the boss's other ships so you can concentrate more on the Princess herself.

Once the princess has been defeated, the operation will be considered complete.
