[[file:Land_Base_Maintenance_menu.png|thumb|right|The LBAS Maintenance menu]]

Above any world menu for LBAS, you can find the button to access the general Land Base Maintenance menu. This menu gives you access to the general level for each of your LBAS groups, including in this order:
*The '''"Limited time Land Base"''' (general events LBAS group), 
*The '''"Southeast Land Base"''' ([[world 7]] LBAS group, currently not available), 
*The '''"Southern Land Base"''' ([[world 5]] LBAS group, currently not available), 
*The '''"Central Land Base"''' ([[world 6]] LBAS group). 
This menu is common to all world's LBAS groups. An additional menu is also found in the admiral's information menu, displaying a brief view of each LBAS group levels.

For each group, you can see (from top to bottom) :
* the LBAS group name,
* the current level of this group,
* the current mode of the group,
* the total number of LBAS opened for the group,
* the total amount of each type of plane in the group with a scheme of the current layout in each LBAS, with in order: 
** LBAS bombers, 
** LBAS attack aircraft,
** Fighters,
** Bombers,
** Seaplanes and recons aircraft.

Every group is initially at level 0, and can be upgraded up to level 3 using 1 [[bulldozer]] each time. You can see how many bulldozers you currently possess in the bottom right corner. 

The effect for each level are the following: 
{| class="wikitable" 
|-
! Level
! swapping cooldown
! morale recovery
|-
| 0
| 12 min
| standard recovery rates
|-
| 1
| 10 min
| faster on "Rest"
|-
| 2
| 8 min
| faster on anything but "Sortie"
|-
| 3
| 6 min
| faster on every mode, "Rest" is 50% more effective
|-
|}

In the case of the 1st group, <font color= "green">'''all level improvements will carry over into future events'''.</font>


Since [[Game Updates/2021/October 29th|2021/09/29 update]], you can no longer access your Event's LBAS maintenance menu outside of events, and so you cannot improve its level.

=Construction Corps=

[[File:Item_Card_Construction_Corps.png|150px|right]]

==Overview==
Also known as "Construction Team" or "bulldozers", those items are obtained through quests and the item shop, and are used for [[Land-Based Air Squadron|LBAS]] unlocking and upgrading.

==Uses==
Bulldozers are currently used for 2 LBAS related upgrades :
*They are needed for unlocking the [[world 6]] land bases
**In order to use the LBAS at World 6, you first need to complete the quest [[Quests#F43|F43]].
**Each bulldozer will open one LBAS in this world, so you need up to 3 bulldozers to open the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd LBAS. 
**The need to open the 3rd LBAS is arguable, for more info, read: [[Land-Based_Air_Squadron#Troubleshooting|Troubleshooting]] 
*For upgrading LBAS groups from each world (events and world 6 for now, and worlds 7 and 5 soon) from level 0 to 3, using the [[Land-Based_Air_Squadron#Land_Base_Maintenance_menu|Land Base Maintenance menu]].

==Acquisition==
One way to obtain bulldozers is via the '''[[Shop|item shop]]''', where you can buy them for 800 DMM points each.

The other way to obtain them is via quests, where up to 4 can be obtained with '''One-time quests''', and then up to 2 can be obtained via '''Yearly quests'''.
