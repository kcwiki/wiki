=Jets=

==Introduction==
Jets were introduced in the [[Game Updates/2016/December 9|December 9th, 2016 Update]]. Jets possess the ability to perform a [[Combat#Jet_Assault|jet assault]] before the aerial combat phase. 

==Overview==

===Mechanics===
1. Two "jets" are currently available in the game, the [[Kikka Kai]] and the [[Jet Keiun Kai]].
*Both jets have unique equipements icons : {{Template:JetFighterBomber2}} and {{Template:JetFighterBomber1}} respectively
*Despite being propelled by one jet engine, the [[FR-1 Fireball]] has nothing to do with "jets" in the game and is seen as a regular fighter.

2. Jets can only be equipped by [[:Category:Shoukaku Class|Shoukaku-class Kai Ni A]], [[Kaga|Kaga Kai Ni Go]], [[Victorious|Victorious Kai]], and placed in [[Land-Based Air Squadron]]s.

3. Using jets will consume steel in addition to bauxite.

4. Having a jet equipped will allow a pre-emptive aerial attack known as '''Jet Assault''' (JA).
* Jets will still participate in the following aerial combat phases.
* [[Damage_Calculations#Airstrike|Damage]] during the jet assault is calculated the same way as dive bombers but damage during the airstrike phase is reduced.
** For LBAS jet assault, '''both''' jet assault and LBAS bombing use the lower multiplier. 

5. Jets have a high [[Anti-Air_Fire#Shoot_Down_Resistance|shootdown resistance]] that reduces the losses to anti-air fire.

! Ship AA resistance
! Fleet AA resistance
|-
| Keiun kai

| Kikka kai

|}

6. Jets will go through '''three''' different shoot-down phases per normal battle.
* Anti-air during the jet assault.
* Shoot down during air control.
* Anti-air during the normal airstrike.
It is unknown if the jet assault phase can trigger [[Anti-Air_Fire#Anti-Air_Cut-In|anti-air cut-ins]].

7. Jets '''do not count''' as dive bombers or fighters and so cannot activate the [[Carrier Cut-In Attack]]s or take part in it.

===Use Notes===


1. Since they use the dive bomber multiplier and have a weaker airstrike, their use against targets larger than a heavy cruiser is limited.

2. They are two of the three fighter-bombers with shoot down resistance. This makes them useful when needing to maximise fighter power while maintaining some striking power. The Kikka Kai is fighter-bomber with the highest anti-air {{AA}} in game.
* This usefulness is limited because they cannot be used to trigger CVCI.

3. The steel cost can add up very quickly. Especially when being equipped on the largest slots of Shoukaku and Zuikaku.
* Note that equipping them in smaller slots limits their ability to contribute to air control and damage.

=Steel Cost=

The steel consumption of jets is:

<math>\text{Steel} = \lceil \text{Plane Count} \times \text{Steel Cost} \rceil</math>

* <math>\text{Plane Count}</math> is the current plane count '''at the start of the battle'''.
* <math>\text{Steel Cost}</math> is the steel cost per plane.
** [[Kikka Kai]]: <math>2.6</math>
** [[Jet Keiun Kai]]: <math>2.8</math>

'''Important Notes'''
* Take note that the costs are '''rounded up'''.
* Jets only cost steel in nodes where they are used for jet assaults and airstrikes.
** Night battles will not cost steel.
* Steel is consumed upon returning to base.
** This means jets can still be used even if you don't have enough steel for the sortie.
* Because LBAS squadrons are refilled between waves, jets will always cost the full 18 planes per wave.

=Acquiring Jets=
Currently the only way to acquire Jets is by obtaining several special items from Quests or [[ranking]], that are necessary to obtain the [[Kikka Kai]] and produce the [[Jet Keiun Kai]] :

* '''Ne-Type Engine''' {{Item/Icon|Ne Type Engine|size=40px}}

* '''New Air Craft Plans''' {{Item/Icon|New Technology Aircraft Blueprint|size=40px}}

* '''[[Prototype Keiun]]''' {{Equipment/Card|Prototype Keiun (Carrier-based Reconnaissance Model)|size=40px}}

==Kikka Kai==
{{Equipment/Card|Kikka Kai|small=true}}

The Kikka Kai is obtainable one by completing the following quest chain, and can be obtained up to 1 per year via the yearly quest By10. 

The total resources required to complete the quest chain are:  
* 18,500 Steel {{Steel}}
* 4,000 Bauxite {{Bauxite}}
* 1x Ne-type Engine (obtained during the quest chain)
* 2x New Aircraft Blueprint (obtained during the quest chain)
* 3x [[Shiden Kai 2]] 
* 2x [[Prototype Reppuu Late Model]]
* 2x [[Ryuusei]]

Completing this quest chain gives you an extra Ne-type Engine for upgrading the Keiun.

==Jet Keiun Kai==
{{Equipment/Card|Jet Keiun Kai|small=true}}

The [[Jet Keiun Kai]] is obtainable by upgrading a [[Prototype Keiun]] via [[Akashi's Improvement Arsenal]].

Up to '''two''' Prototype Keiun can be obtained via quests, and some have also been given as [[ranking]] rewards.

From there, once you have the [[Prototype Keiun]], you can begin to upgrade it through [[Akashi's Improvement Arsenal]] :
