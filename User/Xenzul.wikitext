This life slowly crumbles away
<br />As these wounds of mine shall not be healed

<br />And all I do is stare out this window
<br />Trapped in my own misery
<br />I continue to peel
<br />The days look darker
<br />As the clock ticks away
<br />My life ever so shortened
<br />By this senseless feeling of pain
