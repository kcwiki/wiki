Got through E-1, E-2, E-3 (with some struggle) and E-4 all on easy and got my rewards: Katori and U-511. 
* Yet to complete 2-4 sortie.
* Found out about the Kai Ni badge so i wanted to check about a months worth of progress. Turns out i haven't done much...

Finally got 10 Hishimochi from the event after wasting the little resources i had. 
* I finally collected a team of submarines and the hishimochi event helped me level them up past level 30.Doing Expedition 29 right now and soon 30 and 31 since i can use my level 68 Kongou and level 56 Akagi with 4 of my level 30 subs.I'm aiming to do quests that leads to the creation of Bismarck. 
* The event inflated my HQ lvl from 40 to 70!? 
* Trying to get furniture coins to get the chest set of dolls that cost 20k coins.
* Also need to find last Kongou-class battleship Kirishima for my forth fleet.
