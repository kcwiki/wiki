Just a casual US Admiral helping out the Enwiki pages. I started the game roughly around February of 2016. I took some time off KC post Spring 2016 Event (Iowa-Event). I came back during Fall 2016 Event and kept on playing until now.<br /br>
I mainly help out on some random pages and hoping to get everything up-to-date as soon as I possibly can.
