== Cercospora's Naval Base ==
Cercospora is an cold and calculating admiral who would sacrifice anything for power. The use of slavery, kamikaze tactics, capital punishment is not uncommon in his HQ. However, Cercospora is a fair man who provides adequate breaks and vacation time for his kanmusu, even for the Submarine Task Force. Wages are determined by the ship type, so all kanmusu of the same class have the same wages. To promote competition, bonuses, benefits, and other awards/prizes are awarded to outstanding kanmusu. This naval base is a place where everyone gets what they deserve, the capable flourish and the incapable are trashed.
