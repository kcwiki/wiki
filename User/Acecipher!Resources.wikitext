This article is meant to be the introduction to my own theorycrafting about the game: about how to play it and how to think about it. It is my own personal opinion, and may be under constant revision to better express my evolving views about the game--and about the game as it evolves itself!

==Introduction==

Resources are the heart of Kantai Collection.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the random nature of the game, and the lack of control over battles, it boils down to a game about obtaining, and investing, resources.<br/>

As such, you can probably guess that expeditions are incredibly important--and they are. But so are repair slots, and so are your daily PVP opportunities. After this comes which quests you focus on, how you do your daily constructions, and how many buckets you plan to use between events.<br/>
<br/>
Though it may not seem that way to a new admiral, each and every thing in the game contributes to a flow of resources. This article is made to explore these reasons, and expound upon the most efficient way for new or underpowered admirals to become top-level players.
