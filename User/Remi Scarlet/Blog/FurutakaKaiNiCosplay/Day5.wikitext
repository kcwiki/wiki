So I went out to Home Depot today and went ahead and splurged $120 on equipment and materials. Also blew $60 at an art store for other materials.  Anyway, carrying back near $200 of equipment and materials was not something I would have thought was possible. I feel like I might have dropped a few things along the way.

That said, today I went ahead and continued my work from yesterday by constructing the frame of Furutaka's shoulder cannons. Again, like I said with yesterday's post, this initially posed a large problem for me because I wasn't sure how I could make a joint frame that would be stiff at the joints, be durable, strong and able to hold the weight of the cannon itself. Thankfully, because of what I thought of last night, I figured it'd be worth a shot at trying to execute it. I basically just spent the entirety of today drilling, roasting, rolling and screwing PVC pipes together to get the images below. I won't add much text since what I did is pretty much the same as yesterday, just in more detail and depth. That said, enjoy the pictures. All of my criteria were met with the final frame I constructed so this is an amazing start.
