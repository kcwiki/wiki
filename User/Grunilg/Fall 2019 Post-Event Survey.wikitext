==Event Recap==

===Introduction===

Hello everyone,

this Wikipage will be serving as means to present the Results of the '''Fall 2019 Post-Event Survey''', as I feel that Reddit is a bad platform to convey both Text and Images as Part of the same contribution.

A total of '''503''' Surveys have been filled out and I am very grateful for everyone that participated, as well as those who spread it in their various communities. Submissions have been closed as of 2020/17/1 15:34 CET.

I will be presenting my own analysis shortly, but to those interested, you can download the raw CSV containing all the questions and answers [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LWaNTc1EWKV3-ojlZy-ipRSEAG8HYYKFfkKCZnfqfwk/edit?usp=sharing here]. If you just want a quick and dirty, uncommented look at what google survey spews out, you can take a look at this [https://imgur.com/a/w4uxVeo imgur-gallery].

===Survey Feedback===

I have received a good bit of feedback concerning the survey (some of formal/design nature, others concerning the contents), which in turn has lead me to re-evaluate some Questions:

* Questions 41, 61: "If you did E5H, what was your reason to do so?" and "How do you feel about Friend Fleets as a mechanic as a whole?" were perceived as loaded and will therefore be omitted from my Analysis

* Question 13: "Which of these regular enemies did give you the hardest time this Event?" by itself is rather poor as it usually is not the enemy itself posing the Problem, but rather their placement on the map (boss/preboss/first node etc.).

* No Options concerning pre-clear farms

* To few questions with "other:" Option with textbox to fill in

* Reward-Evaluation Questions were outright horribly ordered

* Question 62: "Do you think the difficulty divide between Main Operations and Extra Operations was intentional?" explicitly states that there was a difficulty divide (on my perception). While there is an Option to negate that perception, a sour aftertaste of framing remains.

===Page 1===

Page 1 generally had two purposes: To get the rough overview over the Event and to be able to compare how representative this survey is compared to Database and Official Data. It also allows me to filter specific Questions by Demographic later.

Let's start off with '''Questions 1,3,4,5,6,7,8:''' Event clear and the difficulties chosen on each map compared against official Data ([https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/1216963143856877568 official KC Twitter]) and Database submission ([https://twitter.com/FlatIsNice/status/1216892278104645634 Tibot Twitter]). Obviously, our sample size is significantly smaller than both of those.

[[file:Page_1.png|thumb|right|Clear Rates per Map]]

'''Conclusion:''' The clear rates on a per-map basis are higher than the official and DB one. This should be fairly obvious as the people filling out this Survey are more likely to have higher engagement in the game. 
Difficulty chosen on E5 on this survey is higher than the official tweet suggests (with Easy and Medium being equal), likewise E6 was cleared on mostly Medium and Hard in this survey instead of an even Hard-Medium-Easy split as the tweet and DB suggests (unless our Casual percentage is way higher than the official one, but all other Data suggests otherwise).

The notion of high (or long term) engagement to the Game is reinforced by Question 2: "How many Events have you participated in including this Event?", with less than 13% only having participated in 4 Events or less including this one.

===Page 2===

'''Question 9:''' "Which one of the new Girls do you like the most?"

Ah yes, the popularity contest. I regret to inform you that most did not pick the [[Akishimo|right Answer]], but overall the result is roughly analogous to the Community Poll on the Front Page of the EN Wiki'''a''' (This survey has a lot more of votes though). If we were to measure popularity by Fanart (uploads on Danbooru) and compare it to our results, a certain amount of United States Navy bias might be seen in those who took the Poll (not surprising considering this is the EN/International Community).

[[file:F 2019 S 2.png|500px]][[file:F 2019 S 3.png|500px]]

<small>Be aware of different colouring</small>

Next up '''Question 10:''' "Which one of the new Girls do you feel will be the most useful in upcoming Events and for general use?"

This subject has been discussed pretty extensively on various channels, but the result in this survey rather clearly shows that Atlanta and her AA power is deemed to be the most useful addition to the current cast. However a not insignificant amount (9%) think that none of the new girls are particularly useful. The addition of a new LHA was welcomed by some (8,2%), while Houston was deemed worthy by another 6,2%.

[[file:F 2019 S 4.png|center]]

The light side is covered now, so let's head for the Abyss with '''Question 11:''' "Which one of the new enemy designs did you like the most?"

Technically CV Hime Kai did get a new CG, but I did not consider the change significant enough to warrant her as an option here.
The Result pretty much speaks for itself, but I'd like to personally congratulate the 91 true defenders of Humanity resisting the temptations of the Abyss.

[[file:F 2019 S 5.png|center]]

'''Question 12:''' "Which one of the new enemies do you think will make a return in the near Future?"

New Event, new Enemies, which might make a reappearance in the near future. No surprising results here either as named Princess-Grade Enemies take some more time to make a return. However, considering the prevalence of the He-Class Kai on every map starting on E1, surprisingly many thought it won't reappear in the near Future. Maybe the Ne-Class Kai was seen as a way more pressing issue here.

[[file:F 2019 S 6.png|center]]

'''Question 13:''' "Which of these regular enemies did give you the hardest time this Event?"

Yep, Ne Kai was perceived as the big bad this Event. But I want to remind you of the statement about Question 13 made in the Introduction. Sub Loli Hime making a return as major source of annoyance (24%) is hardly surprising either, and at this point we might as well get used to her being a permanent addition to final operations.

[[file:F 2019 S 7.png|center]]

===Page 3===

Page 3 will be dealing with '''E1''', which had us killing Supply Depot Hime for starters while introducing us to the new He-Class Kai in P2. Not really much to say here to be honest, only a minor disagreement for Hard Mode players wanting a better reward.

[[file:F 2019 S 8.png|center]]
[[file:F 2019 S 9.png|center]]
[[file:F 2019 S 10.png|center]]

===Page 4===

'''E2''' had us deal with the Heavy Cruiser Princess with the option of unlocking a shortcut, which skipped one air raid, but needed a lighter fleet to facilitate its usage. Only 28% took this option, which is a bit lower than routing on KCNav [http://kc.piro.moe/nav/#/46-2?nodes=R&showMapBackground=false yields with a query] (about 30,4%).

[[file:F 2019 S 11.png|center]]

The map was generally received as easy and the rewards were deemed appropriate. I have to wonder what the 47 people hoping for better Hard Rewards were expecting beyond the best SONAR in the game currently.

[[file:F 2019 S 12.png|center]]
[[file:F 2019 S 13.png|center]]

===Page 5===

'''E3''' was our first introduction to the new Ne-Class Kai. Part 1 of this map containing the new enemy was deemed harder than the second part boss. Most people cleared it with a Surface Task Force, but a sizable amount preferred a shorter Route and went with a TCF instead.

[[file:F 2019 S 14.png|center]]
[[file:F 2019 S 15.png|center]]
[[file:F 2019 S 16.png|center]]

In general, the Rewards were considered appropriate, but not few found the new light cruiser guns lacking.

[[file:F 2019 S 17.png|center]]

===Page 6===

'''E4''' was the final Main Operation. Transport Phase followed by chipping, followed by Debuff and Last Dance. It's also the only (E1P1 doesn't count) Main Operation with Friend Fleets. The majority did not utilize them here though.

[[file:F 2019 S 18.png|center]]
[[file:F 2019 S 19.png|center]]

Part 1 was considered to be of easy to medium difficulty, and the Debuff for LD has been utilized by most Players.

[[file:F 2019 S 20.png|center]]
[[file:F 2019 S 21.png|center]]

However, it appears that 13 Individuals (or 2,6%) were incapable of completing the Debuff because of a very recent mechanic (High Altitude Air Raids), which can currently only be countered by ranking and event-exclusive Equipment.

Part 2 allowed us to take an Auxiliary Ship to the Boss to allow for advantageous Routing (heavier fleet) and On-Route Repairs. Akashi was the favoured choice for this Operation. This Phase was mostly received as alright, but the hard perception made a significant advance here.

[[file:F 2019 S 22.png|center]]
[[file:F 2019 S 23.png|center]]

The rewards were deemed appropriate, but it seems that a craving for something more than a Cruiser Gun was prelevant. Well, and Easy players did not even get one and probably wished they got one. Or they wanted Houston as a reward Ship instead of Shinshuu Maru.

[[file:F 2019 S 24.png|center]]

===Page 7===

'''E5''' as a map is pretty straightforward: Two HP Phases, with the first being cleared with single Fleet and the second by means of a Surface Task Force. The latter had a bit of a Preboss-gauntlet with two Sub Loli Nodes, up to four Airstrikes and two surface engagements. Friend Fleets would also make an appearance here, with a roughly 50/50 split on their utilisation.

[[file:F 2019 S 25.png|center]]
[[file:F 2019 S 26.png|center]]

While P1 was received as easy to alright, P2 was a more difficult affair it seems.

[[file:F 2019 S 27.png|center]]
[[file:F 2019 S 28.png|center]]

The rewards are the really interesting thing on this map though. After all, most people cleared this map on medium and overwhelmingly expressed that just two Airmats over medium difficulty are not enough of a reward to be deemed worthy.

[[file:F 2019 S 29.png|center]]

===Page 8===

'''E6''' as the Final Operation would consist of a Transport Phase, an unlocking Phase, a chipping Phase, an (optional) Debuff and Last Dance. There was a lot to do, yet a lot of people only started chipping with the power of friendship.

[[file:F 2019 S 30.png|center]]
[[file:F 2019 S 31.png|center]]

E6P1 had a fair bit of discussion concerning the "right" fleet to use for the Phase, most people settled for using a Surface Task Force here though. Some were apparently using a Single Fleet here, which indeed would be a rather lengthy affair. Maybe they knew something I didn't.

[[file:F 2019 S 32.png|center]]
[[file:F 2019 S 33.png|center]]

The next Phase was unlocking X Node and was deemed an alright task by most. A-Ranking V Node alongside S-Ranking P were perceived as the hardest requirements of this Phase.

[[file:F 2019 S 34.png|center]]
[[file:F 2019 S 35.png|center]]

Like E4, one was allowed (or forced, depending on who you ask) to take an AUX Ship to the Boss, with the majority taking Akitsushima Kai.

[[file:F 2019 S 36.png|center]]

Chipping itself was not a fun affair it would seem as most deemed it outright painful/a resource drain.

[[file:F 2019 S 37.png|center]]

The Debuff was completed by most with about 30% thinking they could take on the boss by themselves. V-Node was considered the hardest requirement of this Phase with 6 poor souls having to run that node more than 60 times for success.

[[file:F 2019 S 38.png|center]]
[[file:F 2019 S 39.png|center]]

Last Dance was a hard affair for most it seems. Most Kills went to Yuudachi this time around (living up to her name), with next up being Torpedo Cruisers (despite having no Historical Bonus here), followed by Ayanami and a wider gap towards Kinugasa. 3.4% did not get the glory of finishing the boss themselves and had Friend Fleet finish the Job for them.

[[file:F 2019 S 40.png|center]]
[[file:F 2019 S 41.png|center]]

The rewards were only really cherished for hard mode, with the trailing difficulties probably longing for that sweet GFCS Gun as well.

[[file:F 2019 S 42.png|center]]

===Page 9===

Now for some conclusions and post-clear affairs. Let's start this off with the post-clear Farm: De Ruyter and Houston were equally wanted, with Destroyer Escorts of any kind trailing closely behind. Otherwise Akishimo, Hirato and Fletcher (after her disatrous debut in Spring 2019) were the target for a nice fishing trip.

[[File:F 2019 S 43.png|center]]

This would lead right to the next point, '''Question 58:''' "Did you meet your own set goals this Event?" with a majority being able to fullfill them. 22% had to drop the difficulty along the way.

[[File:F 2019 S 44.png|center]]

This Event was the longest in KC History, with 32% feeling that it was too long, but 5,5% disagreeing and even demanding a longer Event. The majority deemed the Event length as "just right". Considering it took place over the holiday season, it is unsurprising that most took a couple of days break from the Event.

[[File:F 2019 S 45.png|center]]
[[File:F 2019 S 46.png|center]]

''' Question 62:''' "Do you think the difficulty divide between Main Operations and Extra Operations was intentional?" has been pointed out in the introduction as wonky question. It would appear however, that such a divide was noticed by most players with less liking it than not.

[[File:F 2019 S 47.png|center]]

'''Question 63:''' "Did you like the Worldbuilding this Event?" raised a few eyebrows. Either by the question itself or the very subtle way the lore is constructed in KC leading to many not noticing it. Reading the Ooyodo Boards might help paint a picture of what happened in this Event. We are actually the aggressors in this Main Operation.

[[File:F 2019 S 48.png|center]]

'''Question 64:''' "Did you like the Soundtrack?"

The soundtrack was mostly liked by those who actually listened to it. After all, this question revealed that almost a third of the players play KanColle muted.

[[File:F 2019 S 49.png|center]]

'''Question 65:''' "How do you rate the Event overall?"

Well, the last Question of quantifyable quality. There is not much to say here, the Event has generally been considered as "better than average".

[[File:F 2019 S 50.png|center]]

'''Questions 66+67:''' "What did you like/hate most about this Event?"

While there are some common themes to be seen here, I'm just going to pick out my Favourites here and dump the rest in a collapsible so you can read through all of it yourself.

But I cannot leave this one out: 

''"No carriers. No carrier support. No ship bigger than a light cruiser. The event in general was boring. It wasn't bad as summer 2019 but I expected a far better event. Also, Azur Lane is better because at least their Janurary Event had Shinano coming out to fulfill the prophecy of the chosen one. Jesus fuck why can't Tanaka just release Shinano already? Instead he brings out the goddamn Australians and the Dutch. Fuck the Australians, they deserve the nuke the Zeon forces gave them in Mobile Suit Gundam. Also Sieg Zeon. Finally who the fuck thought it was a good idea to bring in a fucking dutch? Nobody likes the Dutch Navy. They don't have carriers so they aren't cool. The Dutch don't have anything cool.. Unless it's about hookers. Then everyone loves hookers. Until you catch herpes. Or Aids. Anyways fuck this event."''

<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"><h4>What did you hate most about this Event?</h4>
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
Loli sub, Ne Kai

E6 seems to be unnecessarily complicated with the debuff and a struggle for newer players who want to do hard

E6hard reward and wall to get it

The Stupid



painful nodes in the routing

Ne Kai

The complete and utter lack of any semblance of sane design in e5H and e6H. E5H is just not worth (i still did it) and e6H... the only good thing to be said about it is that you don't need air power. The rest of the map is total, utter, completely idiotic shit.

E5 Hard Mode only having 2 airmats and 1 repairmat over Memedium

E6 Preboss

E6 NotLikeThis

I drop to N

hahahah

Admins being gay

We must farm a lots for these new ship 

Node S on E-6, and I'm sure many would agree.

Screw E6P2 boss

Normal, nothing to be hated. 

....but they were walled behind those goddamned Lolisub + double Ne walls AND THEN the double Super Dyson Kai + double Ne Kai, which are damn impossible to kill during day. That was fucking hell.

Well, could be E-5 that looked way too hard on my league to beat hard, not I had any plans to beat EOs on Hard but without FF it was an overkill. On the other hand I don t like the E-5 new ships the 1st is a DE while the 2nd is just a DD trophy.

Feel like some rewards could have been a bit better. First phase in E-6 felt way too long and could have been shorter





The E4H LD boss almost impossible to kill with 1-10hp remaining

CV-hime Kai air requirements

No time(and resources) for farming Saratoga and I-401 because Ne-class Kai CA keeps denying me from reaching boss node in E-6

Shipgirl-specific damage bonuses; lack of freedom to choose your favorites to realistically clear the maps; multi-phase maps are tedious and must be discontinued; skewed difficulty curve, especially between Medium and Hard; garbage drop rates; "progressive EXP" model that discourages power-leveling; unfair and unrealistic armor levels for non-Princess Abyssals.

E6

MO music was not so great. Maybe too much subloli this event

took me 68LD runs without FF to clear E6

I sank Yuudachi

FF come too late

Christmas and New Years break.

High Altitude Bombers

E-6 Chipping

S ranking node V on E6H. Lbas is a waste of resources 



Ne kai

Low drop rate for Hirato and other new drops

E-6 night battle node

Like every other events, without Nelson = very likely no Hard mode clear. Also screw S-rank only Nelson drop in Summer 19 Event. New player without Nelson will definitely struggle at some point.

E-6's gigantic difficulty spike with the powerful princess fleet for the final boss. While it's up to my personal taste, the fact I had to resort to friend fleets was humiliating. But otherwise, I don't have no ill complaints to it.

The difficulty gap between Medium and Hard on both E5 and E6

Reso drain

hirato drop rate

Another boss that was basically a resource sink with a Debuff gimmick only available after painfully reaching LD. The partly ridiculously delayed FF, that consequently made said boss almost too easy to chip compared to pre-FF. Also the staggered FF release is just unneccessary imo, now that theres a Actication button for those that dont want to use it.

RNG in general



Using Akitsushima or Akashi is pretty much mandatory. Sacrificing a ship slot for routing seems like an annoyance for higher difficulties.

I didn't have enough buckets to clear E6 REEE

Ne kai

Too many Shiplock

whoever made the question about e5 clearly did it on medium and probably got no clue as for what reasons people have for doing maps on hard 



Holy shit, fletchers drop chance

Lenght

Very classic and uninspired event, just like most Phase 2 events currently



Late FF

Idea that you need to snipe boss or have god luck in whole shelling (E6), pre boss with 2 new ne-kai and tsu and he flagship on escort that are hard to kill with dd's.

E6, could've done better in this map

Difficulty spike on EO

RNG on E5/E6

Ne Kai. Node S in general. Node V. All of E6 Preboss really.

Bad difficulty scaling. Terrible, in fact. E6 medium was literally free while hard was neigh impossible without hardcap if you got unlucky on V-node debuff. Also, e6 was significantly harder than the rest of the maps.

Can't decide between sub loli hime or that ne kai

Pre-boss nodes being harder than bosses

E5

E6 friend fleet was really late

Unlocks, never fond of the running around

Sub Loli can just fuck off.

BiS gun for Atlanta locked behind hard difficulty





Ne-Class Kai

Ne-class Kai CA

Powercreep

FUCKING FLETCHER PLEASE DROP ALREADY

E6H was designed around friendly fleets which is BS.



Slow FF implementation. 

Carriers were almost banned from the event

Having to wait fuckin 2 weeks for Friend Fleets

Ne-class Kai can burn in hell

Getting blown to bits.

E-4H LD

Huge difference between medium mode and hard mode.



E6 shipping boss HP

The week between the main operation being implemented and the extra operation made planning for ship locks difficult. 

Using Akitsushima as routing, TCF lock for farming on E3 and E4 P1 and Ne class Kai

E6 chipping

me not getting any new boat while clearing 

Usage of high altitude raids as it just presents an additional hurdle for newer players

Loli sub + night battle nodes back to back on E6

S-ranking Node V and late introduction of FF

tie between 6 shiplocks and difficulty spike MO/EO

Painfull farming of Akizuki (90 S ranks for her) and Fletcher (84 S ranks for her)

E6H S node and W node boss main fleet

Dependence on High-Attitude Raids (it's not bad by itself, but you had only one opportunity to get HA Intercepters, thus if you lost it you would struggle next events like I did)

route to final boss, super tanky boss escorts, high armor meat shields, NE Classes everywhere...



Won't be able to get 5in CD with GFCS because I had to drop difficulty.

The jump in difficulty, I think it should have been distributed a bit more evenly between Main Ops and Extra Ops.



Two BBWD Kai at E-6 boss node.

Its length. It may be contradictory to what I liked most about the event, but I would rather farm the same 3-4 maps for new botes than have an extra 2 maps to grind through.



Im not prepared enough for it



E6H route to boss

unlimited unlocks

Nothing

That it is over already, the Event periods are always my favorite Kancolle time (then again we need the downtime to repair the resource stockpile !).

Hard pre-boss

E6P2 boss node meat shields and S ranking node V

E6 med should have at least given the new AA gun along with it



E-6H chipping

process of framing and drop rate of Fletcher (first)

E6H node V unlock and pre-boss nodes are bullshit



No carriers.  No carrier support.  No ship bigger than a light cruiser.  The event in general was boring.  It wasn't bad as summer 2019 but I expected a far better event.  Also, Azur Lane is better because at least their Janurary Event had Shinano coming out to fulfill the prophecy of the chosen one.  Jesus fuck why can't Tanaka just release Shinano already?  Instead he brings out the goddamn Australians and the Dutch.  Fuck the Australians, they deserve the nuke the Zeon forces gave them in Mobile Suit Gundam.  Also Sieg Zeon.  Finally who the fuck thought it was a good idea to bring in a fucking dutch?  Nobody likes the Dutch Navy.  They don't have carriers so they aren't cool.  The Dutch don't have anything cool..  Unless it's about hookers.  Then everyone loves hookers.  Until you catch herpes.  Or Aids.  Anyways fuck this event.

Not having the time for e6 hard to get a god tier gun. Farming for Fletcher on non boss node drop rate.

E-5 Hard was utterly pointless. E-1 really needs rockets or tanks to clear, which is punishing for new players. Ne-class Kai is stronger than CA-Hime. Unlocking/Debuff in E-6 was confusing and tiresome. Friend Fleet took way too long to get implemented. Lack of air power was really punishing for anyone without any seaplane fighters.

Late introduction of FF

E-6 nodes K and S.

E6H is a nightmare

I dislike when girls (like Hirato) are only available at a low drop rate on a node that has a chance to drop nothing at all.

The difficulty divide 

Bullshit requirements that prevented me from getting the Super Atlanta gun (Hard mode only, required the enduring of two further shiplock tags - E5N/H and then E6H). If there was a non-improved Super Atlanta gun as Medium reward, instead of the radar, I'd have tried Medium - for just a dupe radar (have 3 GFCS and 4 Fletcher-class radars), I simply went Casual and be done with it (not even Easy, because I don't need the medals).

PTSD Imps

NANOMACHINES, SON

Sub hime and node S on E6.



Too many sub Hime's

TCF, Ne Kai, Fighting super heavy ships with a goddamn torpedo squadron (seriously knock it off with this please), LBAS raids that slowly drain your resources.



My 100 last dance runs of E6H. Was depressed to see how painful it gets when u fail even if you tried your best

The heavy RNG needed to dmg the E6 last boss. The escort near impossible to kill normally.



My fucking shit luck on V

Really big gap between Normal and Hard, to the point where you drop the difficulty and the game turns into laughable breeze

The low passing rate of the EOs

Just stop with the "Chip till LD" mechanics already



Double Ne Kai Pre-boss and CV Hime Kai S-rank

Weak worldbuilding 

E-6 Chipping. S Node. Goodbye resources.

no new BB/CV

Excessive focus on historical damage modifiers as a requirement for reliably penetrating boss armor. 

E5H reward

How easy it was.

I forgot about the debuff of E-4, making it unnecessarily hard

Chipping during E6H made me drop; making it through S node was BS for me...

Ne Kai





E6H LD Crit waiting room. New Ships with GARBAGE Stats. 

New abyssals with excessive armor 

fucking neck bitch fucker

A lot of gimmicks to do for certain maps. Poor RNG overall

The difficulty jump from E6N to E6H is absolute BS



Very hard pass rate to Boss on EOs

E2



tsu flag, subhime enroute, ne class kai's armor

The absolute RNG fest that was E6P2..FF clears, lucky Nelson one-shots, TCI taking the boss out of all the ships...  or people taking 150 battles to finally get her hit.  Too many 'all or nothing' shots, too few 'almost but for 1hp' battles.  That and the huge delay on FF for a boss that really felt needed it to limit the RNG to almost-reasonable.

E6H node V... Requiring S ranks on combined fleet battles with no FF in general...

E4H boss was trolling me

Lolisub-Hime. Lack of TÃ´kais to deal with her without having to sacrifice Combat capabilities for half your Escort Fleet / Yasen Fleet.

Not having a nagato or nelson

Double Ne Kai @ S

No sister Sara. Again. (T_______T)



Funnily enough, E-1H. Wayyy too RNG-ey



Overlapping historicals. Why is that a thing now.

E6 S node

Ne-Class Kai

Both e6 preboss. 

Couldn't use my Yamato

Akishimo+Hirato farm



connectivity problems kept me from really enjoying and tackling the event like I wanted to and should have

The difficulty spike was annoying; but clearing & farming takes precedence over pride. As much as I hate dropping difficulty.

Fucking sniper SS Hime



The late introduction of friend fleet. It should have came waaaay sooner.

E5 and E6 were perhaps overtuned, although it does not matter a lot for people who clear on Hard for the sake of it. Having everyone end up with a copy-carbon comp of everyone else's on E6 sounds a little boring too, but that's how historicals work, ultimately. That E6 chipping can go to hell, however. (So does the late arrival of FF)

E-6 P1 and Chipping P2

KC OMEGALUL

S node

Difficulty rise for the extra operations

E-5H

the sudden spike in difficulty from the MOs to the EOs

Missing Hardlanta guns PepeHands

farming

Sub loli hime...

Tanaka's salty balls

E6H LD

The hell that were the E6P2 preboss nodes

very late introduction of the friend fleets

Due to my bad luck I cant get the ships i want or pass E3 fully

Late Friendly Fleets and E-6 Hard boss

Lack of CV usage





Ne-class Kai (CA)

Boss nodes, because I was often unable to kill off the boss on the boss node.

Difficulity divide...

Hard mode relies too much on equipment that are improved

Insane difficulty curve of the EO maps

I'm mad about Houston and Perth's lackluster designs

Sub loli.

Having to rely on TCI crit fishing yet again.

Ne kai



I play mostly for Rewards and Ships and overall they were very lackluster.  Basically the only good equip was HF/DF ASS/DIC sonar and Atlanta GFC gun.  And while some of the ships are cute (/De Ruyter/Atlanta), Atlanta's the only one who'll probably see any regular action.



EO difficulty spike

Event delay means Melon K2 delay

Sub Loli Hime



None



The grind, as usual

Farming both Hirato and Akishimo on same map and different Node

N/a

The stupid Ne-class kais refused to fucking die and Batavia hime took too much to kill. Hated how I couldn't do E6H because of my few resources combined with the maps absurd difficulty made me drop to medium, despite having so many historicals to kill the boss with. Guess I'll have to wait another event till I can get my first FCM.



E5



That I had just gotten back into KanColle the day the event began, and I hadn't prepared for it at all, and so I had to clear on easy (casual on E6). Also the drop rates suck, but that's normal.

How it took far more work just to get to LD on E6H than it did to kill the boss. Also not specific to this event, but the overreliance on historicals to be able to kill EO bosses these days. I want to be able to choose my fleets and send my best ships, but Tanaka is choosing practically every slot in my fleet for me.

not being able to do full hard mode because of shiplocks

the ne-class. deadass

Fletcher's drop rate, she never appeared...

too many gimmicks

Carriers were sidelined for the entire event.

Hirato Farming

transport phases make me suicidal 

Ne-class

E6H LD was overtuned, E5H was not worth considering, lacking rewards for casuals

E-6P2 LD was just a huge game of rolling dices, where you're just rolling dices over and over and over again for that preferred favorable outcome



Ne-class kai

TCF

sub loli hime,

The whole event concept. And the farm required in between to not even be able to try out the last part.

Nothing particular except the random taihas

Difficulty and length



High RNG passing rate to boss node combined with high RNG boss kill for E-6 Hard. 

Fucking EOs

E5 Hard rewards

E5

Taiha's



Ne class FS and Sub Loli Hime

Awful drop rate on old ships

the requirement for similar or same ships for routing on multiple maps

Conflict with holiday season

The difficulty divide between E6H and E6M. E6H felt impossible, yet E6M was an absolute cakewalk.



Ne-Class Kai can burn in hell

E5 Hard LD is way too hard

Short length 



Getting to the E6 boss was impossible

Ne-Class CA

E6H pre boss nodes

NE KAI 

The night battle node on E6 Medium along with the Sub hime

E-6 Debuff & Too weak FF & TCI snipe failed

Ne flagship kai and New sub hime

USS Houston as a drop

Node K on E6

Over 50 runs for De Ruyter, E5 PITA to farm





It took way too many runs to get Fletcher.

Ne-kai

Original end date

WTF was E6H and why are still here? Just to suffer?







E6H being complete bullshit. Like. Absolutely bullshit and getting stuck on it for 2 weeks and still not managing to get the RNG required snipe within time to clear on hard. Also, the huge difficulty gap between hard and medium that seems to grow with every event is just cancer and only really allows fossils to keep being fossils and gates newer players out of catching up. E1 must've been terrible for newer players especially who lack anti-installation equips.

Long and difficult routing to the boss in some maps

E-6H

The pre-node wall



MeatshieldHimes/Too tanky escorts

nerfing the OG Sub Princess and calling it an "upgrade"

The new shipgirls.

E-6 Node W

IRL time I didn't have as it overlaps Christmas and New Year's >.<

Didn't get Saratoga though I farmed for her. Akizuki took 280 runs to get. Forgot about Fletcher on E3...

E5.

The requirement of Rocket interceptors. I missed previous Event Due to real life 



E6 difficulty between easy & medium.  Gap too large.

Sub loli hime, big difficulty spike in EOs

E5 AND E6 were ridiculously grindy

Too many locks and too many phases/steps for the final map.

E6H debuff mechanic and praying RNGesus for TCI sniping in LD

The RNG

The amount of salt generated by the new Ne-Class is astronomical... you can litterally put them in place of BB hime and your taiha rate would not change.

First time i ever spent so many buckets lol

Late introduction of EOs delayed my event start



E6H chipping was painful



Ne ca kai / aimbot acculate 100% 1 hit go home

chipping for debuff

No availability of rocket interceptor for newfaces, some rewards were underwhelming, need of Akashi/Kamo, almost no CVs needed, mass genocide of fairies

Friend fleet releasing too late. 

ne kais

E6H

Chipping E6 was pain



The sublolis



Equipment rewards were mediocre, except for gfc radar

Bad drop rates for my waifus



E5 was way too difficult on Hard, more so than E6 imo and the rewards weren't worth the effort in the slightest.

Mediocre rewards for too difficult maps don't give incentives to clear them on anything more than Easy.



E5's 50% drop rate for Hirato, and late FF

Unryuu's drop rate at E2 node A



So many steps to open E6 P2

Strong single enemy will taiha one of your combine fleet girl during torp phase

Resource draining during retreats

Ne-class kai bullshit on pre-boss

Stupid haters & AL assholes

e-6 s node

needing akashi/kamo kai even on casual

Walls of high armor and HP to compensate with touch and ff. Long risky route on E-6H to compensate for some new P2W item. Players who pass hard may only have high luck roll to snipe boss with no real management skill.

Long wait time for FF. The rng fest that was E6. Chipping was too painful. Difficulty gap between Eos and MOs

Rewards seemed underwhelming. As I mentioned above, I was more inclined to do easier difficulties on maps cause the rewards hardly seemed worth the effort.

E5P1

Delete retard FF because it is useless. 





Tedious Extra Operations

The gap in difficulty between medium and hard mode for the last map is too huge. Definitely banging my head against the wall on hard mode. But after dropping to medium, it only took 2 runs to clear. 1 to chip back into LD. 1 to clear LD. No FF or debuff needed.

Ne kai

E6 preboss (night battle followed by ne kai)



Artificial delay of content by spacing EO and FF by literal days



E6 slapped the crap out of me





Once again, hard mode is required to get the soon-to-be meta-defining equipment. I can't do later maps on hard mode.

the difficulty escalated too much

Farm took more time and resources than expected.

length. way too long, took a break and almost forgot about it.

New girls are pretty lack luster

Medium E5&6 = easy,   Hard E5&6 = insanity  (good luck post-clear farming),  overloaded maps,  Sub Loli forcing OASW & LBAS Toukai usage, more mechanics for more RNG during clears (forced TCI usage, Nelson not Touching, boss node 99.9% accuracy ships & guaranteed Chuuha/Taiha, etc...) Clearing hard e5 = Hirato & Akishimo are myths



some enemies are too hard

UnryÅ« only drops on Easy, dammit.



no medium shiplocks e-6

E5 air strike nodes

everyone else complaining about E6 node V

the difficulty escalated too much in E6 and Ne-class Kai

The atrocious drop rates of specific shipgirls and their locations (some being on non-drop guaranteed nodes). 

Ne-kai CA

E6 Last Dance

Dislike how long before friend fleets are introduced.





E6 K night node

rewards for e5h

Not enough time

Drop rates.

E6 Medium - Hard gap is truly absurd

E6H LD too difficult, had to drop

E6 Chipping

Rewards

Ne-class kai on E6 node S.



Touch dependence. 

Ne Kai

E6 LD

FF introduced way too late, which extended the event way too long



Everything about the EO. The drops, the rewards (yes, including Atlanta), the boring chore of E5, the painful journey of E6, the gatekeeper node, the bullshit difficulty gap between Med and Hard, everything. 

EO routes were cancer. E6H was cancer. the route, V, ne kais everywhere. The randomness of winning. i was forced to attempt to clear without debuff because V was impossible to S rank.

Absolutely painful E6 - Chipping and Last Dance felt completely RNG-based. I felt like I had no control when trying to do the map on hard mode (I dropped difficulty to normal near the end). Even with level 99 ships and mostly mid-end game equipment.

Subs, night battle, akashi getting taiha

Answering this survey

Too easy. E1 to E4 is a joke.

Running out of buckets and having to drop to E6C-getting nothing but Atlanta

Retarded high enemy defense and HP in hard mode boss compositions (especially in EO) and designing the event around the existence of FF and "historical" damage multipliers.

E6P1

Ne class kai

lack of interesting ship drops

Historical bonuses on every map

Ne-Kai class CA and god damn node S in E6

E-6 LD

Land Bases



E6H S node, 40-45 sorties, 11 boss in LD and needed drop, because i lose too much fuel, ammo and needed go back to e5m for farming

Underwhelming rewards, E-6H difficulty too high sanity-wise

Night battle nodes

E5, the resources to run in this map skyrocketed especially fuel and bauxite. Farm for 3 ships, neither drop 





Getting sent back in V node, or losing my Nelson Touch

long and troublesome debuff and unlock mechanism and late friend fleet.  Both makes the "autumn" event end on 2020.

Difficulty of E6 pre-boss nodes, Tsu-class that ruins my day, Requirement of Nelson touch

E6 chipping

Still no Fuyutsuki ("this year" they said 2017)

MÌ¶yÌ¶ Ì¶oÌ¶wÌ¶nÌ¶ Ì¶lÌ¶uÌ¶cÌ¶kÌ¶ E6 Hard preboss nodes



E5

The Fletcher farming and drop rate, but I understand it's rarity.

Troll sub nodes

the art for the new ships could be better



The trolling in E6H node V and the overpowered Ne kai

CV Hime

Ne kai



The fact that I can't clear the event all Hard because of lack of resource, and decent shipgirls/equipments

Too many E6 debuff conditions



So many CLs, yet no real use for them as of now. Except a few.

God awful map for farming Fletcher. 

Sniper subs :looks at lolisub:

E6 literally made me want to rage quit



Doing Debuffs for E4 

slot machine E-6 LD

RNG, duh

Loli Sub Hime



E6 debuff and chipping

S-Rank Node V

E4 TCF Debuffing

Fucking two Ne-class Kai gatekeeper

big difference in difficulties between medium and hard

Ne-Class Kai II/III



Too many SS hime nodes

V node

E6 comps all recommend Nelson touch but not all ttks have her

Almost being able to clear E-4H without debuff (boss to 24hp), spending 4 days leveling lbas proficiency to clear debuff and then having to switch to easy cause I still couldn't clear LD. 



Node S in E-6H was too much RNG. Bad rewards for E-5H ruined my motivation to do an all-hard clear.

Very late FF introduction. Just release the damn FF at once damn it, holding E6 FF for another week for no reason











No good DE farming spot like Winter 18 E1

the node with Ne-class before the final boss

Fucking Ne-Class Kai

E6 being stupidly hard once you unlock X, MO a bit too easy, crap rewards for E5H, more 100+hp CLs isn't a good thing



E-6H attempts being way too expensive and the map taking super long

Loli-hime and forced TCF...

Fucking RNG drops

farming in e5 like honestly fuck that map and its 3 air raids holy shit

Over 60 runs in V node from RNG garbage then 55 in W just to fail



P1 of last map

High Altitude Interception





the intricacy of mechanics... locks is fine to a certain point... but needing a vanguard of users to prod at the maps to find out what works is (i find) totally unneccesary and just delays all the users who cant afford to lock ships away unneccesarily



Not very good rewards for maps, beside E-2.

Difficulty scale between Medium and Hard E6 boss was huge (2 BB Demons soak way too much damage))

2 Ne-Kais in casual E6/2 Sub Princess in casual E5/ SDH in casual E1

E-2

Taiha everywhere

Stop spamming loli hime Tanaka you fug

It run at the same time with the time limited new year quests and that limited my time to farm ships that I don't have. (Fletcher and Houston)

resources hog

E6

My resources and RNG

E5H reward choices and E6 double ne kai pre boss

Zeco

E-5 AP on boss, E-6, enemy escort having 200+ armor with more health than the Boss :), and also S ranking combined fleets outside of Boss :))

Dealing with so-classes to princess subs on every EO map making me reconsider doing harder difficulties and ditching probably useful equipments in favor of getting new ships easily

Too many overlapping historical/special routing ships between the different maps.



The requirement for high-altitude interceptors, since I didnÂ´t participate in the events that awared them and thereÂ´s not other way of getting them.

New sub hime random taiha my ship in E-5 and E-6

The BGM

Good rewards for several map

Atlanta

getting Unryuu

I got most of the new ships and good drops while chipping or on LD.

Local offline event, enjoying other TTK salt

hahahah

Short

Its challenging 

E-1 to E-3 being a breeze.

That i had a lot of historical ships 

Farming for ships I do not have.

The new ships (specifically Atlanta) and reward equipments (her guns) were really worth it....

Hmm, If I need to be honest I liked how I could beat 4 maps in Hard since I never had an event that I've done like this before. Otherwise I like the new ships that appeared  (especially shinshuu maru and Atlanta). Boss was nice too, it was great to see Zeco making Bathavia hime as his first abyssal design (much better than Houston that is). Soundtrack was nice too, I mostly liked the EO ones at best. Overall it was a nice event

Shinshuu Maru is super cute and looks like a Sith. Yuudachi (waifu) had lots of bonuses which was nice. 





The sentiment of accomplishment 

new girls

Girls who needed to TCI did their job well, I'm very satisfied

Houston and Atlanta.

Easy MOs and Hard EOs

I like that they did not go overboard on unlock or debuff gimmicks. Too many of those is a bad thing

the safe sail in MO maps



Event OST

The community.

BGM

Atlanta

MO has decent challenges but not impossible to do yourself. E5P2 Hard last dance composition was lazy and the rewards for it were mediocre. 





Cool new ships



Got Houston while chipping boss Kappa

Overall fun map with lots of fun challenges and battles. As it was one of the few events to have you think outside the box and have you learn how to organize historicals, manages you limited CA/CAV/ and do maps (mostly) without CV/CVLs.

E1 was simple enough to allow a farm without spending too much ressources for overall a good numbers of good drops.

Nothing in specific

AA hime art and bgm

The rather gimmickless MO's were a nice breather from last few events that were packed with unlocks and debuffs. It made them comparatively easy but maybe that could be tweaked, I definetly like the straight forward maps more.

Atlanta



All maps were pretty straightforward without a ton of bullshit gimmicks.

Shinshu Maru



Soundtrack

no air on the route to the boss



I liked how it wasnt a complete slog. There was a nice spread of easy to hard maps.

Perth

Ship variety



DE farm

new equipment, BGM was good and MO were comfy to do.

i get to clear E5 before FF

Increased drop rates

Main OP difficulty



Nothing really. Was kinda boring.

Atlanta's gun - the one with gfcs - and fletcher too



New Girls and Enemies

easy MO gave a good feeling to the start

Knocking down the S-rank for V on the first try and S-ranking the LD right afterwards

Clearing is hard, but totally worth it. Also Atlanta.

Lewdable new ship girls





Atlanta

"E-6 Hard mode" gun

No shibafu art

Watching Dodagu self-destruct without anyone (read: me) around to save his typo-ridden ass

Got my first Hard clear



All the new girls are cute.

The large  number of map, american girls

Atlanta

I got Kamoi who got me Saratoga through LSC. Imagine farming E6 4Head

Blowing things to bits.



A lot of new girls.







Variety of ships used

straight forward maps

the fact I cleared e6h without buckets and baux on second boss encounter

The new kanmusus

Rewards were decent for the amount of time and effort i put into 

First four maps were very doable

music

Fact, that I was able to clear E2 and E3 on medium despite planing to do it on easy. SO basicly did better hten expected

MO felt balanced

Much more new girls then average events have

No Re Class! I fear the day the Re Class Flagship will be  introduced...



New ships all look good. New equipment is bonkers.

Finally being able to use Hiei and Kirishima as historical ships.



Variety of new forgein girls. Especially a new heavy cruiser since Pola of Spring 2016.

The large amount of new botes. That's the biggest reason as to why anyone participates in events anyway. 



Atlanta, Perth



E1-E4

sm's thicc thighs

My luck with clearing drops

Lots of new ships (7 !), with plenty of historical value behind them ; also plenty of good farming possibilities (Fletcher especially).

All around good opportunity to level/farm in multiple maps

E1-E4 Difficulty

Akishimo <3

Altanta

E3 Leveling

all the clear-reward girls are so cute

Variety and number of new ships



It was a large-ish event, but the multi phase stages wernt too cancer.

Atlanta

Good spread of ship drops/rewards. Most are pretty average statwise, but they're also mostly either from nations that haven't been represented yet or classes of ships we haven't seen from a particular nation yet. Final boss theme was definitely one of the good ones. Decent equip rewards. Lack of air power was a sigh of relief - one seaplane fighter and done.

New shipgirls

New foreign ships.

more straight forward than the previous ones 

I was glad to see the boss debuffs are ultimately unnecessary, so long as you are sufficiently lucky.

Akitsumaru drops

E6P2 Boss BGM.

De Ruyter

Atlanta's jugs

That I could farm I-13, Hatsuzuki and Saratoga.



Atlanta and Houston

Year of the Cruiser, we fleshed out our cruiser pool a good bit. Decent guns for CLs.



E5M gun same as E5H. Saves some resources

Poi's raws is so cute, it brings smile and joy in the midst of raining of Taiha

Saratoga drop

Fuck your ass you cunt tanaka

The girls, Hirato and Akishimo were great. Also the scale seemed right and the middle "calm season" for restocking was nice, made it feel like calm before storm.

Honestly, nothing...

Cruisers getting love



De Ruyter, Dutch Admiral hype \o/ :3 :}

Length

Having something to do other than expeditions and monthlies.

Akitsushima finally become useful

A fantastic array of new ships, one of the best lineups we've seen in a while.

Being able to CLT my way through all maps

How easy it was.

A new heavy cruiser and light cruisers

The soundtrack and the new characters' designs

Relaxed difficulty & decent drop rates for new ships.





Practically nothing, Shit Ships, Shit Rewards, Shit event. 

New ships

killing neck

Good difficulty pacing.





First few maps didn't cost too much resources

De Ruyter



the challenge

That MO was accessible for all while EO was more 'exboss' and not 'MO relettered'

The emergency toukai quest, sub homes at the beginning of sorties

Atlanta guns

First half of the Event was suprisingly easy, I did originally NOT plan to finish that many Maps on Hard/Medium.

Losing my chance at boobie sama 

Atlanta, HF/DF, 8inch mod.2, GFCS+5inch

Atlanta.



AKISHIMO SO CUTE. OMG I LOVE HER CHARACTER



Pretty laid back for a large event, and E5/E6 hard is very optional this time around which is nice for new players

Sound track and new boats

Atlanta, De Ruyter

Perth. I wanted an aussie and i got one

Got to use the Touchs and very few air power

E6 boss music



Forced use of lighter ships, making clever use of new Repair mechanic to encourage bringing Akashi/Akitsushima

Atlanta is a great AA ship for exactly that purpose. *cough* 6-5 North Route

Chill soundtrack



Atlanta and her busted AACI trigger rate and shotdowns. 

The brutal curve was actually quite nice and the reward balance is overall great. BGM is on point all throughout and reflects the difficulty well, in a way. The best part ? All the new girls are enjoyable.

The BGM

Atlanta :3

E5 



E-6H P2 BGM

All the new shipgirls except Hirato i liked, they had great designs

Autistic E3 grind and a whole bunch of cute newships (minus E5 exclusive)

Perth, and the duration of Event. (IIRC, this is longest event ever)

Easy to get to the hardest part

Atlanta's boss theme

setting up locks

Smaller Navy ship introduction.

'staya, cunt.

Arashio got buffed although it just only E1



I did like the idea of difficulty divide between MO and EOs.  I just think making the EOs a gauntlet of survining nodes that can OHKO your ships isn't really about gameplay and more about making money off REs,Irako, & Damcons.



Ease of MOs







The sountrack 



The music and the new abyssal designs

Atlanta as E6 reward

New ships

Getting De Ruyter to expand the Bofors family, Atlanta for her powercreep AA guns and Fletcher, Houston and Darth Maru will be fine additions to my fleet.



Getting my Fletcher drop



New American ships.

How simple and straightforward the first few maps are (I wouldn't have minded them being a bit harder with how simple they were).

cute botes

Levelling my ships as I clear the event.

Merciful drop rate on the new girls



Was not a resource black hole like Spring 2019 given E-6 Hard

Main OPs was ez af

The difficulty was just right, for respectvie ones. Ex: Hard being a headache is an expected one than being a breeze.

The designs of the new enemy ships as well as the soundtrack

E6 is awesome w/ new bgm

I finally got Fletcher. My soul is now at ease. 



E1-E4 were very simple

First maps being simple. No more than two phases to get to the boss. Keeping the multiple phases for the last map.

Long length allowed it to be squeezed around heavy college work

New ship girls

Felt too easy on Easy

EZ main ops so EOs could be done easier





I got Fletcher.

The soundtrack as usual, is really nice. Atlanta is a good addition to the game, and isn't completely broken, only really being good at AA.  Shinshuumaru too, another LHA is welcome. Perth is good girl. 

Being able to farm some maps pre-clear

E1-4 was straightforward and not 3+ phases

More girls to obtain



Atlanta

I was able to use my waifu effectively sue to historical buffs

I got to use Akatsuki for the last map without feeling that I could use someone better.

E-3/E-4 sub nodes

New foreign CL

I like that it wasnt the usual super hard equipcolle. Was much more fun for me.

Best event levelling spot to date.

Atlanta



More foreign ships, using ships I don't usually use

New ships and soundtrack

Soundtrack 



Good difficulty balance (except E6H), new girls, good soundtrack.

Worldbuilding

Not worrying much about air power is a nice change of pace. 

The fact that this is the first event i cleared!

Shinshuu Maru

poi!

The designs of the new bosses



New girl

The most girls I want dropped under 10 runs

Ramp up of difficulty, not as rng centric as other events

Good MO difficulty.

1-2 shot final boss

The maps were pretty straightforward and not overly gimmicky

E6 boss BGM was great



More foreign ships that recognize cooperation between countries



I got the rest of the akizukiâ€™s, 2 of which while clearing the map 

More American ships!



Lots of AA enemies this event, being consistent with the final battle and reward. It was challenging but I didn't mind, for the most part.

All the good and important drops are on Casual.



New shipgirls

Atlanta



Pretty easy pre EO

Newbie friendly

Being lucky on drops pepega

The first 4 maps were balanced well. No airpower cancer due to historical event

All

perth

The memes

Free 15 ASW Sonar and new main AA gun for Maya

Atlanta. Well worth the pain 

Farming ships, rewards gave me less incentive to do on higher difficulty

Akashi/Kamo branching and a decent amount of shiplocks







Shinshuu Maru memes

Time length of the event. Had to take a break for 1.5 weeks because of the holidays and being sick. And the length just made everything very manageable.

Atlanta as a reward

MO maps were relatively easy to clear on Hard



New AA CL and new gear for CA, ie 5inCD+GFCS



My third time full clearing and my first time not needing Friend Fleets to clear any part of the EO, even if I play on Casual.  I like the world building and the return of the screamo final boss music, LMAO.





The designs of the new ships are cute. I love the HF/DF Sonar.

I like music in e6 boss node

E6 not being as painful as I thought it would be.

th easy early maps, allows for better farming.

Fair event for those that were prepared (not me)

Good Ships, new crucial drops not placed in E5



some new ships that i wanted dropped for me

I finally managed to get two American ships.



atlanta

Difficult final map

E3 leveling

I like music in e6 boss node

That auxiliaries got some well-deserved attention, though it was in a slightly distasteful way (i.e. used for easier routing/shortcuts).

Finally getting an Aussie ship in the game





Atlanta iyakao

I got Amagi

Difficulty difference

Being able to complete it without needing to drop difficulty.

Atlanta

More new foreign ships

Easy boss farming 

Atlanta is gorgeous

Main Operations are straightforward and relatively cheap to complete.



E-6 BGM, Atlanta and Akishimo.

moderate resource cost

Perth

Lots of collaboration in discord for e-6



Not related to the event itself, but I do enjoy the journey I had with my friends, helping out each other. 

MO wasn't cancer, but E1 would not have been noob friendly with sdh with no anti installation gear.

Soundtrack, obviously. It's the only thing that keeps me playing this game for 4 years.

Multiple shipgirls from different countries, soundtrack with vocal

Finally a new Megane Ship



Sendai got huge historical bonus

De Ruyter

No potential offroutes

soundtrack, ships, overall theme



The event had its hard moments but nothing straight up unfair like last time with the very high air defense requirements.

Not that rsc draining compared to certain â€œsmall scaledâ€ event, not much crappy and boring shortcut unlocks in earlier maps











Got a dupe Sara during Hayanami hunting

Last Boss song

The BGM, and Atlanta

Balanced FF, Appropriate rewards for Hard, farming possible with decent rates



Perth

Getting my first Saratoga. Also being able to farm an event for the first time but that's not really down to the event...

Atlanta

when i killed the fucking abyssals, and when i came lots when i finally got hatsuzuki

De Ruyter and Atlanta are cute



Reward ships

Introduction of Australian ship

Atlanta



more anglosphere ships, better chance for unryuu even tough i didnt have the resources to farm for her



No shiplocks for medium E-6

New twintails

Houston's better CA gun

Getting Unryuu and Amagi finally

Atlanta

E-6 Boss music

The new ships

painful



Challenging and but not hard enough to drop difficulty 

Volume of new ships

Atlanta

Nice Leveling map, 8 screws :), and additional foreign ships

Getting new ships. The only time I get new ships really.

The maps were fairly well-balanced, with a steady increase in difficulty as we progress through the maps.





Atlanta and De Ruyter
