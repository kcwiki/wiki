=Introduction=

This article is meant to be a rough guideline to help you determine which girls you should be leveling. Included in this is which girls you should be using your limited blueprints, action reports and prototype catapults on. Event-only girls are listed separately due to their rarity. Any girl not listed here can be considered low priority.

The bare minimum you'll require for events is '''7DD 1CL 3CA/V 4FBB 2CV 2CVL'''. This covers all combined fleet combinations with no extra capacity for ship locks or historical ships.

As a general rule, girls which require special resources (blueprint, action report, protoype catapult) are rated lower than their counterparts unless they outclass every other girl in that category. Unless otherwise noted, you should be getting girls to their '''highest remodel'''.

'''The advice in this article assumes you already have the girl. Don't stress about missing high priority girls.'''
