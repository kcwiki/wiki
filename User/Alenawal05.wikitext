Good Morning and nice to meet you all...

I'm a young man who enjoyed anime and (shoujo) manga + video games and drawing some anime stuff. I've been wandering around Iwagawa for almost 4 months (or maybe it was 5?) so I still new here.

Currently trying to find Yamato with very ridiculous passion, May the fate called us...
