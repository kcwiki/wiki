Native English speaker.  Student of Japanese.  Tragically at what would be JA-1 on a userbox template... or now that I think about it, I have a "sizable vocabulary" and a "good understanding of grammar" (which comes from having read through the first two Dictionaries of Japanese Grammar like they're textbooks), so maybe I'd be JA-2.  Would probably get blown out by JLPT1 if I tried.  日本語の話はぜんぜん足りないからです。

If I made an edit to your translation you didn't like, revert it.  IF my translation was bad, change it.  Go forth with my blessing.
