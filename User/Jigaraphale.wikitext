=Kancolle enhancement project=

The following list is what I think are good ideas to implement in KC in order to improve the game, while keeping its basic esthetic and having in mind that it's still a free-to-play game that needs to make money. I absolutely do not want to transform this game into a generic and forgettable Gacha, I just want to imagine how an updated Kancolle can be, with many features that I believe are missing in this 8+ years old game. I also consider that no 3rd party software should be used because if the game is "perfect", it simply does not need such things (even so I will still use them myself).


==Must add/change features==
Some features that I believe must be added as soon as possible in order to make the game more forgiving and welcoming for newcomers, more bearable for long-term free players, and richer for any old player.
*New maps :
**EO 1-7 / 2-6 / 2-7 / 3-6 / 3-7 / 4-6 / 4-7 / 5-6 / 5-7 / 6-6 / 6-7  (or just 2 EO/world)
***We are waiting for the 2nd and 3rd EOs of the main worlds since they were introduced. At this point, such EO can serve to re-introduce some rare mechanics, like events ones, such as the arctic gears, the repair nodes, TP nodes, historical fleets …
***some could be changed every month/quarter :
****using older events maps and gimmicks
****In the case of using past events map, it may interesting to replace the rewards with something like ranking points or even a special currency that could buy some old event-limited equipments.
****using randomly generated map (to force you to explore a bit every month) => maybe just 1 or 2, not to overwhelm us
**W7 maps :
***I think they are the best place to serve as an "event tuto world", with event-exclusive mechanics being shown here for newcomers
*new expeditions :
**W3 "C" monthlies
**more W7
**W6 
***maybe W6 expeditions can be limited-time ones, which appear only once, or just once a year, where you can use exotic fleets to have special loot. 
***those expeditions could also be randomly generated.
*a "friend" thing / player-player direct interactions, where players can interact and maybe even play with/against each other
**having the possibility to display our port to other players (to flex ^^)
*increase the dock size to around 150 for all players (maybe give those slots via quests)
**maybe also give 5-10 slots with a birthday quest depending on the added ships
*give one new ring for every st-Val, with a very hard-limited quest
*rework all the shop economy! (some items are too expensive and/or useless)
*a more explanatory crafting system (something that is not some witchcraft recipes like now)
**maybe just give some guidelines/probabilities on which class of item you are going to craft within a range of resources used
*a quest tree, or at least some way to know what we have done and the immediate new quests we can unlock
*more quest rewards info 
*all quest ship can be dropped or/and crafted, so you are not blocked at some point, praying for the next event
*all quest equipments are obtainable at any moment, so you can't stay blocked if you loosed a unique quest item => maybe add a hard limit to how many "special" items you can own, to avoid power creep.


==Sorties==
*possibility at any time to see the fleet state (engagement, air situation, HPs...), so you can maybe close your eyes for more than 0.5 sec without the fear to miss something
**doing it as Kcanotify does is a good starting point
*more obvious routing / LOS effect on the sortie, where you can more easily guess a given map routing by yourself without needing to do several hundred runs.
*in-port log of all the fleets (just the 6 girls) used on the map & its routing, or just the class/types of warships combinations used on the map
*less useless loading times
*give us more stats about one fleet :
**the total stats (the real one, since the current one seems incomplete) 
**the general LOS 
**the air power 
**the combined fleet stats 
**the LBAS air enhancements  
*no more hidden fit bonus (with guns mostly) 
*more "logical" fits (by classes/nations) and logical effects (like AA bonus on CVs)
*no more OP fit bonus (a greater gear diversity is better than some meta defining ones)
*no more broken stats
*some items mechanics need to be reworked :
**the Rice items are useless in battle for now
**the majority of secondary guns are completely useless
**some main guns have no use for their lack of bonus or proper mechanics
**several equipment have no purpose in the game, they are not used in sorties, not scrapped for quests or consumed with Akashi, they need some reworks

==Events==
*historical bonus general debuff, it must be a simple bonus fact, not a game-breaking thing that is almost a "must-have" each time
*friendly fleets from the start, but using them add a drawback, like less/worst drops for instance
*Remove the stupid idea to have the Strike Force fleet in the 3rd fleet, this adds nothing to the game but frustration and big mistakes.
*Remove the possibility to drop nothing on an S rank on absolutely every boss 


==New tuto==
The main goal of a new tuto is not to have a fully detailed explanation of how the game is coded and works, but just to give everybody the Big Picture of what is possible in this game.
*add a brand new tuto that explain more mechanics from the beginning, like :
**cut-in
**opening and closing attacks
**fleet compositions
**day and night battles mechanics
**different nodes guide (combat, night, storm, resources, air raid, refueling, repairing, routing, blue, boss, TP …)
**routing explanations, from LOS to ship restriction, how does it works and how to find it by ourself
**airplanes effects, echelons, attack types, synergies, cut-in, slots size …
**synergies bonus (like for ASW or anti install)
**fit bonus 
**upgrades bonus
*possibility to replay the tuto
*event general tuto :
**locks
**historical bonus
**historical attacks and routings (like 2021 spring Drum fleets)
**LBAS
*special guide for each new mechanic (touch & ci) shown when we unlock it
**for instance, on every Big Seven's Gallery profile, you can find her touch tuto and effects
*explanation of the global effect of more stats
*more world 7/EOs tuto maps mechanics
**=> combined fleet / 7 ships fleets
**=> a "per month lock" ?
**=> special unique gear use (artic gear, Akashi sortie repair, refueling, FCF...)
*Ranking Tuto
**There is absolutely no way a new player rank by himself without any input on what ranking is, the fact that it's a thing, and basically what to do and for what rewards
**Some guidelines on the goals of ranking, how it works (reset & ci) and how to get points, are needed!
*use Katori or/and Kashima as the "tuto mascots "
**give Gotland as the final tuto reward, a nice Easter egg, fixing her obtainability issue at the same time

==Upgrade system==
*increase the screws/week from 4 to about 10 in end-game
**maybe add one map (like a hard new EO) that can give 1 screw/run (eventually caped), or use some new expeditions
*every piece of equipment must be obtainable (via Akashi/quest) no matter the price, so you can never be blocked by a quest and can at some point complete the kancodex
*general screw price balancing, some equipments are way too expensive for what they are, and others are very cheap.
*new Akashi menu UI
**must not be hidden like now
**give more descriptions on the upgrading effects/benefits (like visible stars bonus)
**give us some sort of timetable so we can see who to use without looking at all our ships one by one.


==Farming==
*add more ways to farm multiple things (more adventurous maps like 4-2 & 4-3), so you are not simply dependent on expeditions and too few regular maps
*rework all the expeditions rewards & length (some are way too useless)
*change the brain-dead farms (like 1-1 sparkle, 1-3 fuel, 5-2 Lv...)
**Morale should come back to 50 when the girl rest
**Maybe add a "relaxing mechanic" (like a dormitory, spa, onsen, restaurant…) where you can dock a limited amount of ship to raise their morale above 50 (maybe up to 100), maybe consuming some resources at the same time. You could have a tier system, where every +10 moral point you need exponentially more time/resources to get it.
**maybe add a new bonus for married girls: the morale recover faster and cap higher


==The "RNG issue"==
KC is not an RNG-based game and I don't think that RNG is an issue right now in this game, but I think that some things can be improved:
*Drops :
**The drop system doesn't need anything more, but maybe the idea of a "mercy drop", in order to avoid having to do 435 runs for one particular ship.
**An idea would be to add a "drop pool", where you have all the droppable ships on a given map in it, and so when you drop a certain ship from this pool, her drop rate will decrease, making less likely to have to make a billion runs for any given ship (but still possible). Also, when all the ships of the pool have been dropped at least once, the pool rates reset.
*Routing :
**Since phase 2, there are less to no "non-sense" off-routing, so on almost any map, it's possible to have 1 route or multiple almost identical routes 100% of the time.
**I think it could be nice to have some maps where at some points you have random chances to follow different paths, obliging you to chose fleets suited for any of those situations.


==UI improvements==
*for sparkling (making it more visible)
*to sort ships and equipment by stats/types
*To see the full stats/names for equipment or ships
*dark mode (for my poor eyes)
*notifications for exped, repair, craft, morale …
*expeditions arrival don't need to have the port reloaded to be obtained
*new CG / seasonal CG indicator (so you don't miss any)
*all new ship CGs are immediately unlocked in the kancodex when introduce (if you have the said ship)
*better management for special ships slots, like the Ise K2 class ones, where selecting the 3rd to 5th slots forbid you to put guns, even so the 2 firsts ones are free
*global fleet stat for the expedition menu
*better sound and music management
*In-game dev logs with the possibility to see past patch notes, so we can have a genuine way to see new stuff added for each update, with maybe some announcements on the side using a new kind of board, clearly separating the KC twitter account from the default changelog/announcement board


==Good bonus stuff==
Not really needed, but highly appreciable 
*ranking hints :
**some hints every month start on what will the ranking rewards be (ex: "this month, a plane from the tea country" and a spitfire is among the related rewards), so we can plan our ranking 
*new game engine that runs faster
*mobile update (with IOS maybe)
*desktop app, where you have all game assets already downloaded, reducing the loading times and server load when peoples DL new assets at every new restart.

*'''And also, maybe, eventually, a global release/translation, not a new game release for foreigners, just the possibility to genuinely play this same and unique game from aboard.'''



==Things I absolutely do not ever want to see ==
*Gacha lottery
*auto quest selector
*skin economy
*premium currency (for exclusive stuff)
*"fast mode" to skip content (maybe a skipped animation using a special currency can be good)
*"autoplay" 
*limited currency to limit how much you can play per day
*auto repair system
*auto formation mode
*auto click to continue
*auto-leveling mechanic
*specific unit/commander equipments
*post WW2 content (to some extent)


==Conclusion==
In the end, what I want here is a game with a bit more polish, which is beginner-friendly and still has an interesting late game.
I want to see more of the "announced" and/or "exclusive" content to be properly implemented in the game, making it looks more like an up-to-date game, and not just an old fossil with some paint.

Basically, I reject anything that is the signature of Gacha games, and which will just transform KC into another generic and forgettable game.
I also want to avoid content exclusive to old players, not to hardcore players, just old players, like the Shinden kai, which creates an unfair and undeserved segregation/street creed between recent and older players. If you want to flex, just use exclusive furniture.

For a final note, the best thing that could happen to Kancolle is having the developers listen to the community, because in 2021, most of the best FTP games see an active debate between their devs and fans, bringing a constant benefic feedback loop to enhance the game. Better than "me" to improve this game is all of us '''AND''' the devs.


=Kancolle speedrun=

A speedrun competition where you need to clear  KC maps as fast as possible.
Here, only in-port time, combat time, and sortie time are counted; "black loading times" are cut to prevent any unfair advantages, but most "in-game loading times" are kept for simplicity.

In the end, the best speedrunners are the ones who navigate through the menus with ease, assemble fleets quickly, use the best routes, clear nodes the fastest, and avoid A ranks and retreats at all costs.
Any retreat, off-route, bucket used, S rank failed, or fleet assembly mistake must be avoided in order to achieve the best time possible.

==Categories==
For the different "clearing categories" we have :
*A- All MO but W7
*B- All MO with W7 double boss, cleared
*C- All MO with W7 double boss, not cleared
*D- All MO with W7 last boss, cleared
*E- All MO with W7 last boss, not cleared
*Subdivided by :
**X1- No EO
**X2- All EO, cleared
**X2- All EO, not cleared

For each category, you need to obtain an S rank on the boss of each map (just reach node N for 1-6). When the boss has a health bar, depending on the category, you either need to deplete the bar during the speedrun if you are in a "boss not cleared" category, or you need to clear the map only if has already been depleted when you are in a "boss cleared" one.

'''A1 and D2 should be the most popular choices since doing the not cleared versions is only possible once a month.'''

No order in particular should be imposed, so players can do the most "RNG bound" maps 1st to avoid long wasted runs and also add some moral management ease. If any order should be imposed, the only logical one is to clear the worlds from 1 to 7 in display order (1,2,3,7,4,5,6) or in numerical order (1,2,3,4,5,6,7), within each world the maps cleared from 1st to last in order.

For 3rd party users (KC3, Poi, Kcanotify…), the speed runs can be divided into 2 main categories, the "Vania" and the "3rd party" ones.
Regarding the connection type to the game (nothing, VPN, KCCP, Goto browser …), since all "black loading times" are cut, all modes should be included, but since modes like KCCP also decrease some "in-game loading times", they are encouraged.

==Some rules==
When you start your speedrun, 100% of the ships you will use during the run must be unequipped, since having more equipments available can give unfair advantages. Also, you are only allowed to use your 1st fleet to clear the run, and the ship in it at the start of your run must be one that is not used on the 1st map cleared. During the run, you can keep some ships equipped to gain some time, and you are allowed to use the base equipment saving slots, you are also allowed to use the base fleet saving slots.


Since paying captains and free captains will be playing this mode, it is logical to limit some aspects of the paying ones. 
The limitations are :
* 100 different ships max per speedrun
* 2 repair docs in use at a time max (but bucket use is allowed and encouraged)
* Base fleet saving slots max
* Base equipment saving slots max
* All RE must be empty
* No repair fairy allowed
* No morale cakes are allowed
In the end, only multiple married girls are allowed for paying captains.
The paid LBAS are not taken into account since upgrading them plays a minor role in clearing the maps.


==Miscellaneous points==
*Since the Android version is a bit different from the regular one, maybe it should be banned to prevent any potential unfair advantage.
*Regarding the RE rule, it can maybe be voted to allow the use of some very common RE, like the ones on some RLK2 capable ships, or on Yuubary but only for turbine use.
*Regarding the use of "exclusive items" like events or ranking limited ones, all are allowed, but if at some point one is judged to be too overpowered, it can be banned to be used.
*Regarding the use of graphic mods like the EN patch, if they keep the main essence of the game without giving any significant advantage (like a hypothetical fast loading pack), they are allowed.
*Regarding the navigation thru the ship menu, having all your ships at Lv 99 or at a specific Lv can help to assemble a fleet, but since any captain is supposed to know his own fleet and that he will at some point have to navigate between multiple pages anyway, we can assume that no significant advantage can be obtained by having a certain fleet over another.
