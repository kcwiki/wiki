New Front Page is now live! Sure took a while to plan and build, but it was well worth it. Built from minimal CSS and HTML designs, it should be quick and concise. At least that's what I was shooting for.

Now that the frontpage is finished, it's time to rebuild the old dusty templates and pages around the wiki, with the same design aspects as the front page. After all, content has to be presented nicely!

Since an event's round the corner, I think it's time to rework the event templates. Yeah I think that's good.
