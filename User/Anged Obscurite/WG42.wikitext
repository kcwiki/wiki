Example: Tone/Chikuma K2, with 2 20.3 Guns (not no.2 or no.3), [[WG42_(Wurfger√§t_42)|WG42]], and Type 3 shell, would have (in night battle):

(77 + 2*8 (20.3cm x2) +1 (WG42 Equip) + 75 (WG42 vs Installation) ) * 120% (double attack) * 250% (Type 3 equipped vs installation) = about 507 Attack Power before cap (which turns into 314 AP after cap).<br>
AP before-cap becomes about 354.9 when Tone/Chikuma is in orange (turning into about 307 AP after cap).

Without the WG42, The AP is (77+16) *120% * 250% = 279, but drops to 195.3 AP in orange.

Against E-4 hard boss (190 armor), the expected damage falls off dramatically:
*at >50% HP, expected damage is 124*2 = 248 with WG42, 89*2 = 178 without WG42
*at orange, expected damage is 117*2 = 234 with WG42, but only 5*2 = 10 if only Type 3 is used.
