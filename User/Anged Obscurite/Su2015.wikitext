<TITLE:Yellow-green & Underline>It's important to sortie to the regular maps too!</title>

The Summer Event: Time-Limited Map "Counterattack! Second Operation SN" has started. It's important to have some levels on your ship girls along with decent equipment and stockpile of resources while deploying to the Time-Limited Map!
Admirals who have come onboard only recently should not immediately enter the event map and should first round out your fleet and increase the experience of your fleet. Only after you have done sufficient preparation should you enter the event map!

Those admirals with high HQ Levels will be able to select the difficulty of operations. Admirals confident in their preparations should definitely try the normal difficulty. In addition, admirals with high HQ Level will also be able to choose the hardest difficulty.

*You can change the difficulty, but the map gauge will completely recover.
*New ship girls rewarded for clearing operations will be available regardless of difficulty chosen.
