[[File:Senko.png|thumb]]Began collecting daughters 5/9, right after the Spring 2014 event.

Can read moonrunes (slowly) and talk moonspeak (quickly).  Does translation cleanups, as well as prettify language and clarify that suppositions are just that.  Writes or something for a living in RL.

Does not have a favorite daughter.  Leaves no daughter behind, also refuses to keep clones around.  Likes to roleplay Isoroku Yamamoto's brain in a jar.  Addicted to Kai Nis (Missing: U-511).

147/151 Shipgirls in Fleet, 147/151 Shipgirls Remodeled.

===Favored Daughters===

* [[Kaga]] - くうでれ, Best Secretary
* [[Kirishima]] - First Battleship, 眼鏡
* [[Mutsu]] - あら あら, 妻 です
* [[Inazuma]] - Starter
* Destroyer Death Squad - [[Hibiki]], [[Shigure]], [[Ayanami]], [[Yuudachi]], [[Yukikaze]], [[Shimakaze]]
*[[Goya]] - Best submarine-dechi.  First provisional fiancee.
*[[Suzuya]], [[Kumano]] - You girls are literally so great.  Though I'm getting really tired of people drawing Kumano's boobs the same size as Suzuya's.  Weirdest pet peeve.
*[[Yuugumo]] class - I'm not sure why, but you're my favorite set of destroyers.
*[[Souryuu]] - Second Provisional Wife.  Best CV.

===<span style="font-weight:bold;">Missing Daughters</span>===
*[[Tanikaze]] - Couldn't find you at E-2 in Winter, hopefully we can get you out of 3-5 soon.
* [[Sakawa]] - My last non-Destroyer to collect.  Your sisters won't be lonely.  Assuming they recognize you.
* [[Isokaze]] - I really just have to admit that I'm not quite worthy of you yet.  I'll keep working at it.
* [[Asashimo]] - We fought to our last bullet trying to find you, really we did.  Next event, hopefully.

=== Other ===
* [[Kisaragi]] - Okay, you were never my favorite, but I didn't want THAT to happen... Here, just carry this DameCon around with you.
* [[Ooi]] - A very honest and emotional girl.  With lots of torpedoes.  I don't dislike that.
* [[Fusou]], [[Yamashiro]] - It's rather crude of me but goodness you girls are lovely.  I've taken pains to change your luck, so smile a little more, okay?
* [[Kongou]] - You're confident, optimistic, energetic, responsible and happily dorky.  So you're basically the perfect woman.
