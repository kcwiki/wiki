=About=

Quests are missions that you can do in the game that will give you resources, equipment, items and even ship girls upon completion. It is a good idea to complete quests as they can give you plenty of resources outside of [[Expeditions]] and are the main source of Improvement Materials (Screws) outside of events and monthly sortie maps.  

==System Overview==

To accept a quest, simply click or tap on the quest and an orange icon will appear to show you that the quest is in progress. 
*You can only have up to '''5''' active quests at a time
*Completing quest [[#D18|D18]] will award a '''Headquarters Personnel''' that will allow you to have up to '''6''' active quests at a time. Currently there is no other way to obtain '''Headquarters Personnel'''.

As you fulfil the quest requirements, the quest will update with a tracker at:
*50% complete
*80% complete

When the quest is complete, the orange icon will change to a blue icon. Simply click or tap the quest again to collect the rewards.

==Quest Types==

Quests are divided into 7 types:
* [[#Composition_Quests|Composition (編成)]]
* [[#Sortie_Quests|Sortie (編成)]]
* [[#Exercise_Quests|Exercise (演習)]] (PvP)
* [[#Expedition_Quests|Expedition (遠征)]]
* [[#Supply_.2F_Repair_Quests_Quests|Supply/Repair (補給/入渠)]]
* [[#Factory_Quests|Factory (工廠)]]
* [[#Modernization_Quests|Modernization (改装)]]

These quests can be broken down further into:
* One-Time (単)
* Daily (日) - '''Resets at 0500 JST (UTC +9) every day'''
* Weekly (週) - '''Resets at 0500 JST (UTC +9) every Monday'''
* Monthly (月) - '''Resets at 0500 JST (UTC +9) on the 1st of every month'''
* Other (他) - This category includes Quarterly quests and Daily quests with odd reset schedules
**Quarterly quests '''reset at 0500 JST (UTC +9) on the 1st of December, March, June and September'''

==Additional Information==

* Uncompleted repeatable quests are not carried over to the next period. All progress will be lost.
* Prerequisites for repeatable quests will be counted if the reset period of the repeatable is within the reset period of the prerequisite.
**Example: [[#Bm3|Bm3]] requires [[#Bw4|Bw4]]. If you complete Bw4 on Monday when it resets, and the 1st of the next month falls on Tuesday, Bm3 will be unlocked when the monthlies reset.

These quests relate to resupplying and repairing ships.
* When completing [[#E4|E4]], each resource for each ship counts as a separate resupply. This means if you resupply the fuel and ammo separately for a full fleet of 6 ships, you can count 12 resupplies towards the required 15.

=Factory Quests=

These quests relate to construction of ShipGirls, development of equipment, scrapping either and upgrading equipment.
* For quests relating to equipment scrapping, it counts the number of times that the scrap button is pressed not the number of equipment selected. This means scrapping equipment one by one saves you the most equipment.
** Exception is [[#F34|F34]] that will count if you scrap 6 AA guns at the same time
* Quests which require you to have certain equipment on a certain flagship have special rules and '''will not complete''' if after you have scrapped the equipment you:
** Change the flagship
** Unequip the required equipment
** The required equipment has been locked
* Please double check the above when completing those quests so you do not waste equipment
