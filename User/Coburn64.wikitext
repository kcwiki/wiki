Some say that he plays Kantai Collection upside down. Others say he's an aussie that is usually seen hanging out with [[User:Totaku|Totaku]] in the voice chat. For all we know, he's called Coburn.

== Just who is Coburn? ==
Coburn started his Kantai Collection career during phase 1 of KC, which was when the game was in its flash era. Completely new to the whole game and how its mechanics worked, he was able to clear some maps before he sank one of his first battleships, [[Fuso]] due to foolishly thinking that he would be able to revive the girl after the battle was over like a Pokemon game. Unfortunately for him little did he know that KanColle uses a perma-death system unless you've got a Repair Personnel equipped. PTSD set in and he went AWOL.

He returned to KC at the start of Phase 2, and has completed some mini-events along with his first major event which included bagging [[Nisshin]].

Coburn is a computer geek at heart and possesses the ability to see mechanics inside games and figure out ways how to make them better. He also fell in love with [[Tenryuu]] due to her personality and has married her since December 2019.

== Where to find Coburn in his natural habitat ==
Coburn is frequently found chatting on the Kancolle English Wiki Discord server. He is fluent in Australian English. Usually you will spot him hiding in a voice channel, where he will lurk while playing KC and joining him usually leads to discussion about a variety of topics, including non-KanColle topics and politics.

Overall, Coburn is a nice person. He tries not to offend anyone, although he does follow a "Zero Bullshit" rule of his. He is also not afraid of calling out bullshit, be it done by other members or in disputes. As long as you don't come across as a jerk, you'll find that Coburn is a nice person to talk to.
