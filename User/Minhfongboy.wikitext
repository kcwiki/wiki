==Event Difficulty Summary==
The difficulty of an event is judged based on 3 factors:
*How easy can an admiral that is fully prepared clear hard mode of all the maps
*It assumes all available mechanics at the time of that event
*It also assumes all available friendly fleet at the time of that event, especially after the final batch
<font color="green">'''Lower'''</font> point means easy event, the <font color="red">'''higher'''</font> the point is, the harder the event

==Expedition Type (Great Success conditions)==
Conditions for GS in expedition are splited into 3 types:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Expedition Type
!GS Conditions
|-
|style="background-color: #7df83a; text-align:center;"|'''Type I (Normal type)'''
|'''All ships''' must be sparkled<br/>
'''All numerical expeditions (Excluding World 7 ones, i.e 41-45) that don't require drums''' follow this rule
*'''A1, B1, B2 and 42''' also follow this rule
*24 and 40 are the '''only''' exception that don't follow this
|-
|style="background-color: #15f4ee; text-align:center;"|'''Type II (Drum type)'''
|'''4 ships''' must be sparkled<br/>
Number of the '''total drums brought must be 135%''' the amount of the requirement (rounded down)<br/>
'''All drum expeditions follow this rule, i.e 21 37 38 44'''
*'''24 and 40 also follow this rule''', despite not being a drum expedition for some reason. They both require 4 drums to meet the 135% drum condition above
|-
|style="background-color: #ffff00; text-align:center;"|'''Type III (Level type)'''
|Greatly depends on the flagship level, meet '''one''' of the following:
*'''Flagship Lv 128+ and 4 ships''' in the fleet sparkled
*'''Flagship Lv 33+ and 5 ships''' in the fleet sparkled
*'''Flagship Lv 32- and all ships''' must be sparkled (This ideally meets the same condition as '''Type I''', but I will include it here anyway)
'''All World 7 and letter expeditions (Excluding some of the letter ones mentioned above obviously) follow this rule, i.e A2-A6, B3-B5, 41, 43, 45, D1-D2, E1'''
*'''32 also follows this rule''' although it's unlikely players will use expedition 32 due to it's long duration

==Searchlight Behavior==
'''How searchlight actually works''': Okay, assuming a night battle fleet with 6 ships. If the searchlight was activated, the game will attempt to roll the target to check whether that target is the girl carrying the searchlight (SL). If this attempt failed to roll that girl, it will '''repeat the roll again''' up to two or three attempts total, depends on the type of the searchlight. '''The process will stop once it rolled the girl carrying the SL OR once it failed all the attempts and accept the target rolled in the last attempt as the girl to be aimed at.'''
===Normal SL===
*For this type, '''the game will roll only twice at most'''. 
*So what is the rate of the girl carrying SL will get aimed? Lets take a look of all the scenarios:
**Scenario 1. '''Attempt 1''': The game will roll her immediately, thats 1/6 chance = '''16.66%'''
**Scenario 2. '''Attempt 2''': The game will fail the first attempt (Rolled 5 other ships instead of that girl, so 5/6 = 83.33%), but will successfully roll her on the second attempt (1/6 = 16.66%), that means this scenario has '''83.33% x 16.66% = 13.88%''' chance of happening
**Scenario 3. '''All attempts failed''': The game will fail both attempts, meaning '''5/6 x 5/6 = 69.44%''' chance that '''she will NOT get aimed at'''
*We can see above to draw the following conclusion:
**The girl carrying SL has '''16.66% + 13.88% = <font color="red">30.54%</font>''' chance of getting aimed at
**'''69.44%''' that she will '''NOT''' get aimed at

===T96 Big SL===
*For this type, '''the game will roll only thrice at most'''.
*So what is the rate of the girl carrying SL will get aimed? Lets take a look of all the scenarios:
**Scenario 1. '''Attempt 1''': The game will roll her immediately, thats 1/6 chance = '''16.66%'''
**Scenario 2. '''Attempt 2''': The game will fail the first attempt (Rolled 5 other ships instead of that girl, so 5/6 = 83.33%), but will successfully roll her on the second attempt (1/6 = 16.66%), that means this scenario has '''83.33% x 16.66% = 13.88%''' chance of happening
**Scenario 3. '''Attempt 3''': The game will fail the first two attempts (Rolled 5 other ships instead of that girl twice, so 5/6 x 5/6 = 69.44%), but will successfully roll her on the third attempt (1/6 = 16.66%), that means this scenario has '''69.44% x 16.66% = 11.56%''' chance of happening
**Scenario 4. '''All attempts failed''': The game will fail all attempts, meaning '''5/6 x 5/6 x 5/6 = 57.87%''' chance that '''she will NOT get aimed at'''
*We can see above to draw the following conclusion:
**The girl carrying SL has '''16.66% + 13.88% + 11.56% = <font color="red">42.1%</font>''' chance of getting aimed at
**'''57.87%''' that she will '''NOT''' get aimed at

===Effect of the SL on the girl===
*Whoever carried it will get -80% evasion (0.2x modifier stacked on her effective evasion). If the said SL is <font color="red">'''+max'''</font>, the chance of '''her getting HIT''' increases (More likely to take damage)
**On the same note, <font color="red">'''+max'''</font> searchlight '''doesn't change the rate of getting AIMED at''', it's still the same as base one.
*If the fleet contains 2 girls or more carrying the SL and T96 SL, the T96 SL will take priority. If they carry the same type of SL, the higher-order girl will take priority, as in ship 1 being the highest order, followed by 2, 3 and so on....
*Notice one important thing in the above point: All the girls carrying the SL will '''get -80% evasion regardless of her searchlight being activated or not'''
**On the same note, the game '''will also treat whoever carrying the SL as the SL target''', thus increasing the chance of hitting the SL girls as mentioned above (The process will stop as long as '''the game rolled the girl carrying SL, even if that girl's searchlight never activated before''')

*Despite the increased getting hit rate, it's still recommended to max the SL because it offers '''+3 firepower'''. It's also suggested that improved SL reduces enemy CI even further while increasing our side CI so it's great to put some investment on this equipment

===Flagship protection shielding the girl holding the SL===
So far, '''all the cases mentioned above assumed all the ships have equal getting aimed rate''', meaning the flagship position wasn't considered. If we consider the flagship protection too, we can have a more interesting result where '''the girl carrying the SL in flagship will be shielded by the other ships in the fleet, thus reducing the chance of getting aimed at.'''
*'''Line Ahead''' has 45% FS protection, the rate of triggering the shield are '''13.74% (Normal) and 18.94% (Big SL)'''
*'''Diamond''' has 75% FS protection, the rate of triggering the shield are '''22.90% (Normal) and 31.57% (Big SL)'''
*'''Double Line, Echelon and Line Abreast''' has 60% FS protection, the rate of triggering the shield are '''18.32% (Normal) and 25.26% (Big SL)'''
(''CF4 and CF2 in combined fleet might be equivalent to Line Ahead and Double Line respectively, but no data proved this yet, take this claim with a grain of salt'')
<br/><br/>In practical use, especially during event, '''it's ill-advised to put searchlight on FS''' due to the potential of triggering this shield where the other girls could have stood alone and shot the enemies instead of taking bullets for the flagship and wasting a shot.
