==New Event Mechanic: '''Army Depot'''==

Each Tank unit has 18 tanks within the unit, there are four slots for tanks, however, one slot can be used for an AP shell to give your tanks more firepower against targets like abyssal cruisers and destroyers and other armored targets at the cost of one tank company. Depending on what tanks you have in the army depot will reflect the amount of damage you can deal on an enemy installation. If an enemy is in a river, or canal sometimes tanks can target enemy fleet units. Your tanks can be taken out by the enemy fire and it will cost ammo and steel to replenish them. As long as an enemy node is near or on land your tanks based in the army depot can be used to attack the node. Node selection is the same as the LBAS in where you can send half of all against one node. Tanks will arrive before your fleet arrives on the scene just like LBAS however if LBAS is used on the same node as tanks the LBAS goes first before the tanks are used in support.

*[[M4A1 DD]] x1.5 Bonus
*[[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tanks & Marines)]] x1.15
* Tauchpanzer IVD x2.5 Bonus

==Map Phases Breakdown==

==Phase 0.5: Unlock the Path to the Suez Canal (Node V)==

<tabber>
|-|Node C=
* Recommended Fleet: Single Fleet 1 AV 5 XX
* Route: {{MapRoute|A|blue|C|red}}
* LBAS: Range 1 
** Have the fleet using Fast AV (Either use Nisshin or speed mod any fast AV)
|-|Node F=
* Recommended Fleet: Single Fleet 4 CA(V), 2 (F)BB(V)
* Route: {{MapRoute|A|blue|D|blue|E|red|F|red}}
* LBAS: Range 3 
|-|Node H=
* Recommended Fleet: Single Fleet 6 DE
* Route: {{MapRoute|A|blue|D|blue|E|red|H|red}}
** LBAS Range:  2
|-|Node I= 
* Recommended Fleet: Single Fleet 1 Cl 5 DD
* Route: {{MapRoute|A|blue|D|blue|I|red}}
* LBAS: Range 2
</tabber>

Once all conditions are met the path to the 2nd TP area will be unlocked.

==Phase 1: Free up the Suez Canal==

The aim of this phase is to deplete the HP Phase as quickly and efficiently as possible. Uses of 6 Submarine is highly recommended for this phase as they have a 2.5x Bonus against the Suez Canal Hime staying at Node N. The boss armor is at 400 HP and she has 999 HP for players to chip. Make sure to equip your ship with TCI for maximum damage. 

* Recommended Fleet: 6 SS or 5 DD 1 CL with full TCI Set Up
** It is possible to use a combined to get to Node V, but, using this fleet will force you to take the longest route to reach Node V and you will be going through all the nodes
* Route: {{MapRoute|A|blue|D|blue|I|red|J|blue|K|blue|L|red|N|blue|P|red|Q|red|T|blue|V|red}}
* LBAS: Range 8, 166 AD/ 331 AP /744 AS under hardest composition
* Additional Notes: Vanguard Formation can be utilized to help with preboss Nodes. Support Expeditions are essential to clear this phase on LD

==Phase 1.5: Unlock the TP Node==

This is not required on lower difficulties. On Hard Mode, you need to A+-Rank Node D consisting of up to 3 Supply Depot Hime, 1-2 Artillery Imps, and 2 PT Imps. Set up your Ships according to equipment to deal with them as outlined [[Anti-Installation#Equipment_Setups|here]]. PT Imps are weak to AA Guns + Skilled Lookouts on your DDs.

<tabber>
|-|Node O=
* Recommended Fleet: Single Fleet with full anti installation nukes to squash Supply Depot Hime
* Route: {{MapRoute|A|blue|D|blue|I|red|J|blue|K|blue|L|red|N|blue|O|red}}
* LBAS: Range 7 
** LBAS with 1 fighter 3 Bombers is recommended in squashing Supply Depot Hime
|-|Node V=
* Recommended Fleet: Same Fleet used against Evergreen Hime
* Route: {{MapRoute|A|blue|D|blue|I|red|J|blue|K|blue|L|red|N|blue|P|red|Q|red|T|blue|V|red}}
* LBAS: Range 8 
** All Land Fighters in Land Base 1-3 (Optional)
* Notes:
** This should be achievable without using a Land base, so you can opt to put your land base on rest
*** The Node becomes easier after you cleared the map once preparing players for the TP phase
</tabber>

Once all conditions are met the path to the 2nd TP area will be unlocked.

==Phase 2: Deplete the TP Gauge==

The aim of this phase is to deplete the TP bar as quickly as possible. Given the TP bar is very big (10,000 on Hard Mode) and Tanaka himself stated that it will take you days to clear out the TP. Take your time to try and clear the TP phase and bring as much Daihatsu as possible in order to deplete the TP Bar fast.
* Recommended Fleet: Transport Combined Fleet: 1 AV 1 CAV 4 DD + 1 CL 2 CA 3 DD
* Route: {{MapRoute|A|blue|D|blue|I|Red|J|blue|K|Blue|L|red|N|blue|P|red|Q|red|T|blue|V|red|W|blue|Z|red}}
* LBAS: Range 11, 50 Airpower for AS (108 LD)
** The routing may look daunting because of the longer route. The nodes however mostly comprise of choice node and empty nodes 
** Node V will be heavily nerfed after the initial clear allow the player to pass through the node much easier
*** This is technically the pre boss node as the very next node will be node W which is an empty node.
*** The player can choose to go to node X to repair their ship just in case they get damaged in Node V or any other nodes before.
