==Parameter Naming==
Module invocation is done via passing parameters and arguments. These parameter names and argument values are all done in the following format
*<Node Letter><Pattern Number>_<parameter> = <argument value>
except for assigning node labels which is shown below.

All parameters still need a pipe character, "|", before the parameter call. 
Eg, (replace '{' with '{{')
*{#invoke:EnemyEncounters | encounterTemplate<br>|A1_xp=900<br>|A1_lv=< 80<br>|A1_node_info=BBV_Re-class_Elite bbv_re-class_elite cv_wo-class_flagship_kai clt_chi-class_flagship ss_so-class_flagship ss_so-class_flagship<br>|A1_form=line_ahead<br>}

All parameters passed to the EnemyEncounters module are named under a simple scheme as described in each subsequent section.<br>
<b>You may add span and css tags as you wish as they will be pasted in directly to the page. Examples are below.</b>

'''''<span style="color:red">Everything is Case-Insensitive</span>'''''
===Node Label===
Simply pass the name of the node with 
*<Node Letter>_label = <some name>
For example,
*A_label =  Night Battle
*B_label = 敵前衛警戒部隊 &lt;br&gt; &lt;span style="color:yellow"&gt;Day Battle&lt;/span&gt;

===Air Superiority and Air Supremacy===
The module will automatically calculate required air power for Air Superiority and Air Supremacy.
*<Node Letter and Pattern Number>_enemy_air_power = <value>
'''Do not pass a value of 0 unless enemy launches plane but has 0 air power (e.g. [[Anchorage Water Demon]]).'''

For example,
*B2_enemy_air_power = 50


===Boss Nodes===
If an explicit boss node is not given, the module will assume it is the last letter given.

*boss_node = <Node letter>
Eg,
*boss_node = M
*boss_node = J

===Xp===
*<Node Letter and Pattern Number>_xp = <value>
Eg,
*F3_xp = 120

===Pattern By Level===
In the case that a pattern's appearance is determined by the HQ level such as 1-5 ExOp's first node.
*<Node Letter and Pattern Number>_lv = <expression>
Eg,
*A2_lv = >80 (Node A's pattern 2 will show up for admirals over level 80)
*A1_lv = <=80 (Node A's pattern 1 will show up for admirals equal to or under level 80)

===Form===
Form refers to the enemy formation.
*<Node Letter and Pattern Number>_form = <formation>
Formations are:
*line_ahead
*double_line
*diamond
*echelon
*line_abreast

Examples are:
*A1_form = line_ahead
*B2_form = line_abreast

===Node Final Forms===
This is for denoting that a certain node pattern is the final form. For example, the composition of an enemy fleet might change for the final kill of a gauge map. These would be denoted by being a "final form" of the node's patterns. The parameter takes multiple arguments because there may be multiple final forms for a node.

*final_form = <space separated list of nodepatterns>
Eg,
*final_form = C2 C3

===Node Post-Clear Forms===
This is for denoting certain node pattern(s) that only appear after the map is cleared. These would be denoted by being a "post-clear only form" of the node's patterns. The parameter takes multiple arguments because there may be multiple post-clear only forms for a node.

*post_final_form = <space separated list of nodepatterns>
Eg,
*post_final_form = D2 D3

===Enemies===
Enemies are passed in a single parameter,
*<Node Letter and Pattern Number>_node_info = <argument>
The formation argument should simply be the enemy names, listed below, separated by a space.
All spellings are English spellings. Eg, "harbor" instead of "harbour".
All enemy information can be seen at the bottom of the source as there is a gigantic table of the mappings.

Enemy ship names are done as follows:
*<Shiptype>_<Class Name>_<Extra Ship Parameters>
where Shiptype is from the following list
*DD
*CL
*CLT
*CA
*CVL
*CV
*BB
*BBV
*Transport
*SS

The class name is for example:
*Wo-class
*Re-class
*Nu-class
*Ha-class

The Extra Ship parameter is optional and from the following list
*Elite
*Flagship
*Flagship_2
*Flagship_Kai
*Late_Model

'''Some examples are:'''
*''SS_Yo-class''
*''Transport_Wa-class_Flagship''
*''CVL_Nu-class_Flagship''
*''CV_Wo-class_Flagship_Kai''

'''For bosses, type out their full name (don't use shorthand like BB_hime).
*For final forms, simply add "_final_form" at the end
*Floating Fortresses and Escort Fortresses have three forms and need "_1", "_2", and "_3" appended
**floating_fortress_1
**floating_fortress_2
**etc
*For Hoppou (Northern Hime), the 3-5 form has 3-5 appended as such
**northern_princess_3-5_final_form

You would invoke the full argument such as follows:
*B2_node_info = clt_chi-class_elite dd_ro-class_elite dd_ni-class_late_model
*C5_node_info = dd_i-class_late_model cl_he-class_flagship

You can find all ship names via the [[Enemy Vessel|enemy vessel's]] page. Simply replace spaces with underscores.

===Information for Non-Combat Nodes===
For nodes such as maelstroms and resource nodes, you will use the "node_info" argument.<br>
As a note, the words <b>"fuel"</b>, <b>"steel"</b>, <b>"ammo"</b> and <b>"bauxite"</b> will be replaced by their respective small icons such as
[[File:Fuel.png|Fuel|25px]] [[File:Ammunition.png|Ammo|25px]] [[File:Steel.png|Steel|25px]] [[File:Bauxite.png|Bauxite|25px]]

Eg,
*B2_node_info = Maelstrom fuel -50 75 100 125
will result in
*''Maelstrom [[File:Fuel.png|Fuel|25px]] -50 75 100 125''

Eg,
*B3_node_info = "Must be my imagination" (battle avoided)
*C2_node_info = "steel +100 125 150 175

==Example invocation==
<code>&#123;&#123;#invoke:EnemyEncounters|encounterTemplate<br>
|A1_xp=900<br>
|A1_lv=< 80<br>
|A1_node_info=BBV_Re-class_Elite bbv_re-class_elite cv_wo-class_flagship_kai clt_chi-class_flagship ss_so-class_flagship ss_so-class_flagship<br>
|A1_form=line_ahead<br>
|<br>
|A2_xp=9000<br>
|A2_lv=> 80<br>
|A2_node_info=fuel +50 75 100 125<br>
|A2_enemy_air_power = 33<br>
|<br>
|B1_xp=900<br>
|B1_node_info=Maelstrom fuel -50<br>
|B_label = 敵前衛警戒部隊 &lt;br&gt; &lt;span style="color:yellow"&gt;Day Battle&lt;/span&gt;<br>
|final_form = A2
|post_final_form = A1&#125;&#125;</code>

will result in 

{{#invoke:EnemyEncounters|encounterTemplate
|A1_xp=900
|A1_lv=< 80
|A1_node_info=BBV_Re-class_Elite bbv_re-class_elite cv_wo-class_flagship_kai clt_chi-class_flagship ss_so-class_flagship ss_so-class_flagship
|A1_form=line_ahead
|
|A2_xp=9000
|A2_lv=> 80
|A2_node_info=fuel +50 75 100 125
|A2_enemy_air_power = 33
|
|B1_xp=900
|B1_node_info=Maelstrom fuel -50
|B_label = 敵前衛警戒部隊 <br> <span style="color:yellow">Day Battle</span>
|final_form = A2
|post_final_form = A1}}

Ignore the nonsense pattern information, please :D (Apparently you fight a maelstrom at node B and it's only day battle)
