=Introduction=

This article aims to provide you with advice on the best way to farm necessary resources. As a general rule, [[Expeditions]] are the best way to gain resources. Sorties do provide a decent return on primary resources ({{Fuel}}{{Ammo}}{{Steel}}{{Bauxite}}) but it works out as trading away one or more primary resource for another.

''Only repeatable quests are listed on this page. One-time quests are also a major source of secondary and special resources. Please refer to [[Quests]] for more details.''

=General Tips=
===Sortie Tips===
* Having the lightest possible fleet is recommended to reduce costs and maximise gains.
* [[Drum Canister]]s and [[:Category:Landing Craft|Landing Crafts]] will increase the resources gained from nodes.
** The 11th Division and M4A1 do not increase resource gain.
** Amount gained varies from map to map.
* You will need to '''complete a battle after the resource node''' in order to claim the resources.
** Exceptions are resource nodes that are dead end nodes.

===Expedition Tips===
* Always try to sparkle for expeditions. This increases the great success chance which significantly boosts income. Your own tolerance for tedium will determine what is the minimum expedition length to sparkle for.
* Read the expedition requirements carefully. This can prevent wasted time.
* '''Always remember to resupply your expedition fleet'''.
* Raw resource returns is not as important as returns per hour.
** The exception is when you will be away from the game for long enough to complete lengthy high-return expeditions.

===Quest Tips===
* Quests are an excellent source of secondary resources ({{IR}}{{IC}}{{DM}}{{IM}}).
* While it is ideal to use the lightest fleet possible to maximise primary resource gains, it is more important to have a fleet that can reliably clear the quest for secondary resources.

The objective is to '''reach node D then retreat after node E'''. DO NOT attempt to farm node G. The [[maelstrom]] at node H has a chance to deplete all of your fleet's fuel. This is a fairly simple and straightforward map to farm but requires multiple fleets if you want to farm it non-stop. Take note that only the AO fleet guarantees routing to D. Kamoi is preferred over Hayasui because of the latter's cost. The AV fleet has random routing (weighted towards D), unless you bring 4 DE. But 4DE will significantly reduce your resource gains because they cannot carry drums or landing craft. The submarine in both fleet options will be able to tank every enemy you'll encounter.

This map can be used to farm both fuel and bauxite. The fleet used is the same for both resources. Fuel is '''obtained from node B'''. Take note that you '''do not have to retreat if heavily damaged at G'''. This is because node J is a dead end node and will end the sortie. Unlike 1-3, a majority of the fleet needs to be combat focused. While this means you cannot bring as many bonus equipment, the base resource gain is higher. This map will cost more buckets compared to 1-3. You should take the AV over Hayasui because of the latter's cost.

==3-2==
The main method to farm this map is to send one sacrificial DD equipped with a [[Repair Team]] and some drums. Simply continue after the battle at node A to reach node B. The repair team will not be consumed. After the sortie, simply move the equipment to a new DD and sortie again. Because you are using a fresh DD each time, this map can be run consecutively. Do note that this method will tank your sortie win ratio. You will need to watch that ratio to ensure you maintain the 75% win rate needed for event participation.

The second method is to send a fleet of 3-6SSV. This method brings a greater return but carries a higher risk and has steeper requirements. SSV can only carry [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank]]s. This equipment is difficult to obtain and carries a steep {{IM}} cost. Furthermore, there are only 4 non-event SSV. The enemy fleet also contains 1-2 ASW DD that can cost you buckets. All this translates into 18-36 more ammo per run.

Sortie=
===1-4===
There really isn't a good place to farm steel but this is the only map where it is possible to do it at low cost. This map has random branching which means you are not guaranteed to hit the steel node. The bright side is that you can gain {{Ammo}} or {{Bauxite}} instead. What you want to do is maximise the power of your opening strike to minimise the damage your DDs will take. Since a majority of the enemies encountered have weak ASW and are forced to target submarines, taking one along can allow you to subtank the map. You will want to '''retreat in the battle after the resource node'''.

''Farming 2-4 for {{IR}} is meant to be a '''last resort'''. Expeditions are the superior way to gain {{IR}}.''

Farming this map can prove a bit frustrating because of the random routing at node C. If you get offrouted to node G, it is best that you refresh the game and end the sortie. If you need the {{DM}}, then you can continue on and retreat after node I. The maelstrom at node C also increases your fuel costs for farming. The basic strategy is to have 3CV/Ls for routing and to do the heavy lifting with 2SS/V to act as tanks. The DD is just there for an additional radar to reduce fuel loss at the maelstrom.

Farming this map can prove a bit frustrating because of the random routing at node C. The setup is essentially the same as for bucket farming. You can use an AO to force routing to node G but it will cost you some buckets as AOs cannot take hits as well as DDs.

| style="text-align: center;" | DD
| {{GreenGunDP}}{{GreenGunDP}}{{Radar}}
| It is recommended you have two [[10cm Twin High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]] equipped along with an Anti-Air RADAR to allow your DD to AACI. While there is not much enemy air power en-route, the chip damage from airstrikes can add up.
|-
| style="text-align: center;" | CV/L
| {{BluePlane}}{{RedPlane}}{{GreenPlane}}{{Radar}}
| Use the RADAR to block out the CV/L's largest slot and limit bauxite losses. You need at least 144 fighter power for AS+ at node F. Therefore, the fighters should take priority in the 2nd largest slots until you have reached that threshold. It is recommended you use medium ranged CV/L or range-extending bombers so that the DD doesn't interfere with the CV/L's attacks.
|-
| style="text-align: center;" | SS/V
| {{TorpedoWeapon}}{{TorpedoWeapon}}
| Simply load the SS with torpedoes. Ideally, she should have two [[61cm Triple (Oxygen) Torpedo Mount]]s to maximise her armour.
|-

| {{GreenGunDP}}{{GreenGunDP}}{{Radar}}
| This setup is for [[Hayasui]]. She essentially fulfills the same role as the DD. She has very high fuel costs.
|-
| {{SeaplaneFighter}}{{SeaplaneFighter}}{{SeaplaneFighter}}
| This setup is for [[Kamoi]]. The seaplane fighters can free up slots on your CV/Ls to take more bombers. This increases the power of your opening strike and helps ensure less damage is taken.

While this map has the potential to return significantly more DevMats than 2-4, it is also costlier and more difficult. The enemies encountered are strong and any node has the potential to force a retreat. Furthermore, you need to score at least a B-rank at the boss in order to claim the resources. This can be a tall order when fighting BB, CA and DD Hime with a light fleet. Also, the resources gained are random between {{Ammo}}, {{Bauxite}} and {{DM}}.

|-
| {{Sonar}}{{Sonar}}{{DepthCharge}}
| At least one or two of your DDs should be on OASW duty. The flagship SS at node C can pose a threat to your fleet and cause you to retreat.
|-
| style="text-align: center;" | CL
| {{TorpedoWeapon}}{{TorpedoWeapon}}{{TorpedoWeapon}}
| It is highly recommended that you use either [[Abukuma|Abukuma Kai Ni]] or [[Yura|Yura Kai Ni]] for this map. Preferably the former. You'll want to equip either of them with one midget sub and two torpedoes to maximise their opening strike. Other CLs can work but you will increase your retreat rate and struggle even more to get a B-rank at the boss. 
|-
| style="text-align: center;" | AV
| {{Seaplane}}{{Seaplane}}{{Seaplane}}
| Loading the AV with Seaplane Recons will increase your chances of getting more DevMats from node G and H. [[Akitsushima]] with three [[Type 2 Flying Boat]] has the highest chances but also the most likely to be damaged.
