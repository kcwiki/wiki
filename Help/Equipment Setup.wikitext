=Introduction=
This article aims to cover the most commonly used equipment setups for each ship type. It is to give you an idea of what are the most efficient load outs to make your girls effective in a particular role. This means that this article will not cover niche setups that are specific to a map. For those equipment setups, please refer to the map pages.

!style="text-align: center; background-color:#99CCFF;"| '''Notes'''
|- 
| {{GreenGunDP}}{{GreenGunDP}}{{WildCard}}
| This is the most basic combat setup for all destroyers. Green dual-purpose guns like the [[10cm Twin High-angle Mount]] contribute Fleet Anti-Air (FAA) while allowing your destroyers to perform night time double attacks. Ideally you would be using the [[10cm Twin High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]]. Destroyer guns do not provide enough extra firepower to allow them to contribute to day combat. The extra FAA from dual-purpose guns will help more by mitigating airstrike damage. The wildcard can be anything that doesn't interfere with double attacks. In most cases, this will be an Anti-Air {{Radar}}. This will allow any destroyer to activate AACI API5. 
|-
| {{RedGunLight}}{{RedGunLight}}{{Radar}}
| This is an alternative setup for maps with minimal enemy air power. This setup should only be used for destroyers with fit bonuses. It is for maximising firepower just to squeeze out every last bit of damage.
|-
| {{TorpedoWeapon}}{{TorpedoWeapon}}{{TorpedoWeapon}}
| This setup is the standard torpedo cut-in (TCI) setup. It should only be used on destroyers with at least 50 {{Luck}}. Destroyers with 40 {{Luck}} are still possible candidates for TCI, but should be placed as the flagship to maximise their trigger chances.
|-
| {{TorpedoWeapon}}{{TorpedoWeapon}}{{WildCard}}
| This setup is an alternative TCI setup. This setup is typically used for either powerful destroyers (E.g. [[Yuudachi]], [[Ayanami]], [[Naganami]]) that can hit the night battle cap with two torpedoes or low luck (30 {{Luck}}) destroyers. In the case of powerful destroyers, the wild card can be night battle equipment or a main gun. The latter will help them maintain some effectiveness during day combat. For low luck destroyers, the wild card should be a {{SurfaceShipPersonnel}}. This will help increase their trigger rate somewhat.

!style="text-align: center; background-color:#99CCFF;"| '''Notes'''
|- 
| {{Sonar}}{{DepthCharge}}{{DepthCharge}}
| This is the ASW setup that maximises the ASW bonus you get. One of the depth charges needs to be a Depth Charge Projector ([[Type 3 Depth Charge Launcher|Type 3]] or [[Type 94 Depth Charge Launcher|Type 94]]) while the other needs to be a normal Depth Charge ([[Type 2 Depth Charge|Type 2]] or [[Type 95 Depth Charge|Type 95]]). Take note that '''reaching the OASW threshold takes precedence over everything'''. So you should just replace depth charges with equipment that has better ASW if you cannot hit the threshold with this setup.

|- 
| {{LandingCraft}}{{Amphibious Tank}}{{AntiGroundArtillery}}
| This setup is for dealing with [[Supply Depot Princess]] and her variants. Since she is the only installation that takes post-cap damage, this setup will allow any girl to kill her in one shot.
|-
| {{GreenGunDP}}{{GreenGunDP}}{{LandingCraft}}'''/'''{{Amphibious Tank}}'''/'''{{AntiGroundArtillery}}
| This is the more typical setup for anti-installation work. It still gives significant bonuses against all installations and allows destroyers to double attack at night. Which equipment you pick for the 3rd slot depends on your upgrade values and/or what the destroyer is capable of equipping.
|-
| {{GreenGunDP}}{{GreenGunDP}}{{AntiGroundArtillery}}{{AntiGroundArtillery}}
| This is a unique setup for [[Tashkent]]. The two anti-ground artillery gives her a significant boost to firepower that allows her to cap in day and night.

!style="text-align: center; background-color:#99CCFF;"| '''Notes'''
|- 
| {{GreenGunDP}}{{GreenGunMG}}{{SurfaceShipPersonnel}}
| This is an anti-[[PT Imp Group]] setup. The combination of equipment makes hits nearly guaranteed and their low HP means they can be killed in one hit. It does mean that the destroyer's combat effectiveness is severely reduced against other targets though. Therefore, it is highly recommended that you use Reinforcement Expansions to fit the {{GreenGunMG}} so that another main gun can be used to maintain double attacks.

|- 
| {{GreenGunDP}}{{GreenGunDP}}{{WildCard}}
| Destroyer escorts will be used primarily for ASW. In the event that you need to use them for combat, green dual-purpose guns like the [[10cm Twin High-angle Mount]] contribute Fleet Anti-Air (FAA) while allowing them to perform night time double attacks. Ideally you would be using the [[10cm Twin High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]]. Small main guns do not provide enough extra firepower to allow them to contribute to day combat. The extra FAA from dual-purpose guns will help more by mitigating airstrike damage. The wildcard can be anything that doesn't interfere with double attacks. In most cases, this will be an Anti-Air {{Radar}}. This will allow any DE to activate AACI API5.

Take note that '''reaching the OASW threshold takes precedence over everything'''. So you should just replace depth charges with equipment that has better ASW if you cannot hit the threshold with this setup. Take note that DEs have bonus armour penetration from Depth Charges.

|- 
| {{RedGunMedium}}{{RedGunMedium}}{{Seaplane}}
| This is the most basic combat setup for most light cruisers. The exception would be light cruisers that have 0 plane slots. In that case, swap the seaplane for any utility equipment that won't interfere with the double attack setup. 
|-
| {{TorpedoWeapon}}{{TorpedoWeapon}}{{TorpedoWeapon}}
| This setup is the standard torpedo cut-in (TCI) setup. The usual candidates are [[Yuubari|Yuubari Kai Ni Toku]] and [[Abukuma|Abukuma Kai Ni]]. the latter needs to be luckmodded to be viable.
|-
| {{TorpedoWeapon}}{{SeaplaneFighter}}{{RedGunMedium}}{{GreenGunDP}}
| This is a unique setup for [[Yura|Yura Kai Ni]] that allows her to provide air support while maintaining night time double attacks and opening torpedoes. The gun in the Reinforcement Expansion must be a [[8cm High-angle Mount]] or [[8cm Twin High-angle Mount + Additional Machine Guns]].
|-
| {{TorpedoWeapon}}{{RedGunMedium}}{{RedGunMedium}}{{WildCard}}{{Radar}}
| This is a unique setup for [[Yuubari|Yuubari Kai Ni Toku]] when she isn't running the full TCI setup. The wild card can be a tank, landing craft or anti-ground rocket for anti-installation work or a sonar for ASW work.

|- 
| {{RedGunMedium}}{{RedGunMedium}}{{AntiGroundArtillery}}{{AntiGroundArtillery}}
| Primarily only 4-slot CLs will be used for a dedicated anti-installation role because the daihatsu-capable CLs are better suited to other roles. The bonus firepower from the anti-ground rockets are more than enough to let any of the 4-slot CLs hit the day and night caps.

|- 
| {{TorpedoWeapon}}{{Radar}}{{WildCard}}{{GreenGunDP}}
| This is a unique setup for [[Yura|Yura Kai Ni's]] AACI. The gun in the Reinforcement Expansion must be a [[8cm High-angle Mount]] or [[8cm Twin High-angle Mount + Additional Machine Guns]]. The wildcard should preferably be a {{RedGunMedium}} to allow her to maintain night time double attacks. If need be, the midget submarine can be swapped for a recon seaplane to allow her to perform daytime spotting.
|-
| {{RedGunMedium}}{{Seaplane}}{{WildCard}}{{WildCard}}{{GreenGunDP}}
| This is a setup to take advantage of [[Ooyodo]]'s reinforcement expansion. By placing a [[10cm Twin High-angle Gun Mount Kai + Additional Machine Guns]] in it, it allows her to perform artillery spotting and night battle double attacks while freeing up two slots for utility purposes. The wild cards can be anything that doesn't interfere with the special attacks. It can be night battle equipment or a [[Fleet Command Facility]].

!style="text-align: center; background-color:#99CCFF;"| '''Notes'''
|- 
| {{RedGunMedium}}{{RedGunMedium}}{{Seaplane}}{{WildCard}}
| This is the most basic combat setup for most heavy cruisers. It provides both day and night double attacks. The wild card can be anything that does not interfere with the double attack setup. The wild card is usually a RADAR of some sort to increase the artillery spotting trigger rate.
|-
| {{RedGunMedium}}{{RedGunMedium}}{{RedGunMedium}}{{Seaplane}}
| This is an alternative setup for CAs in the main fleet of a combined fleet. '''Do not''' use this setup if your CAs are expected to engage in night battle. This setup gives them extra hitting power for artillery spotting at the expense of having a terrible night battle cut in.
|-
| {{RedGunMedium}}{{YellowGun}}{{YellowGun}}{{WildCard}}
| This is an alternative combat setup where your CAs are expected to be fighting without artillery spotting. The extra secondary guns will give them extra firepower in the daytime without interfering with night time double attacks. Any secondary gun can be used but yellow ones are preferred for the higher firepower. The wild card can be anything that doesn't interfere with night battle attacks. It will typically be night battle equipment or an additional yellow gun.
|-
| {{RedGunMedium}}{{TorpedoWeapon}}{{TorpedoWeapon}}{{WildCard}}
| This is the standard CA setup for TCI. Since any CA that can TCI or should be luckmodded to be capable of TCI can already hit the cap with two torpedoes, it is better to have a main gun over a 3rd torpedo. This will allow them to be somewhat effective during the day and gain the bonus accuracy from equipping an [[:Category:20.3cm_Variants|IJN 20.3]]. The wild card can be anything that doesn't interfere with this setup. It will typically be night battle equipment.

| {{RedGunMedium}}{{RedGunMedium}}{{Seaplane}}{{GreenAmmo}}
| This is the typical anti-installation setup for CAs. It is sufficient to allow CAs to hit the daytime shelling cap against most installation targets. It also allows them to perform artillery spotting. 
|-
| {{RedGunMedium}}{{RedGunMedium}}{{AntiGroundArtillery}}{{GreenAmmo}}
| This is an alternative anti-installation setup for CAVs. It allows them to significant damage to all installation types in exchange for not being able to artillery spot. CAVs with this setup are able to hit the night battle shelling cap against installations.

|- 
| {{RedGunMedium}}{{GreenGunDP}}{{Radar}}{{Seaplane}}{{GreenGunMG}}
| This is a unique setup for [[Maya|Maya Kai Ni]]. This is the typical setup that allows her to perform artillery spotting, night time double attacks and AACI. There are several variants to this setup depending on what role you need her to specialise in. Trading a {{RedGunMedium}} for a {{GreenGunDP}} will let her focus more on anti-air at the expense of artillery spotting. If you have two [[5inch Twin Dual-purpose Gun Mount (Concentrated Deployment)]] or the GFCS variant, you can maintain artillery spotting and AACI.
|-
| {{RedGunMedium}}{{SeaplaneFighter}}{{SeaplaneFighter}}{{SeaplaneFighter}}{{GreenGunDP}}
| This setup is for [[Suzuya|Suzuya Kai Ni]] and [[Kumano|Kumano Kai Ni]]. It maximises the air power they can bring to bear while maintaining night time double attacks. One SPF can be swapped out for a recon seaplane if you need them to perform daytime spotting as well.

!style="text-align: center; background-color:#99CCFF;"| '''Notes'''
|- 
| {{RedGunHeavy}}{{RedGunHeavy}}{{Seaplane}}{{RedAmmo}}
| This is the most basic combat setup for BBs. The AP shell enables the most powerful artillery spotting attack and provides bonus damage. You should be running this setup a majority of the time. For 5-slot BBs like [[Ise]], [[Hyuuga]] and [[Musashi]], a {{GreenPlane}} or {{SeaplaneFighter}} would generally be used for extra air power.

|- 
| {{RedGunHeavy}}{{RedGunHeavy}}{{Seaplane}}{{GreenAmmo}}
| This is the typical anti-installation setup for BBs. It is generally not used that often because BBs will already hit the daytime cap and losing out on APCI reduces their power and effectiveness against other targets. This setup is more viable on 5-slot BBs that can also take an AP shell and get the best of both worlds.
|-
| {{RedGunHeavy}}{{RedGunHeavy}}{{Seaplane}}{{Amphibious Tank}}'''/'''{{LandingCraft}}
| This is a unique setup for [[Nagato|Nagato Kai Ni]] and [[Mutsu|Mutsu Kai Ni]]. While it does give up APCI like the regular BB anti-installation setup, tanks and landing craft have much better multipliers across a wider range of installation types. This can make for some devastating attacks when combined with their Touch mechanic.

| {{RedGunHeavy}}{{RedGunHeavy}}{{Seaplane}}{{RedAmmo}}{{Radar}}{{GreenGunDP}}
| This is a unique setup for [[Musashi|Musashi Kai Ni]] and requires a [[10cm Twin High-angle Gun Mount Kai + Additional Machine Guns]] in her reinforcement expansion. This setup should also '''only be used in a main fleet''' of a combined fleet as it can trigger main/secondary cut-in at night. This setup allows Musashi to perform AACI. It also her a higher trigger rate of artillery spotting because the equipment setup fulfils the trigger requirements for a wider array of special attacks.
