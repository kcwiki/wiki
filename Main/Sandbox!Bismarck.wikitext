*She was responsible for sinking the world's largest battlecruiser, British [[Wikipedia:HMS Hood (51)|HMS Hood (51)]].
*She and her sister ''Tirpitz'' were the largest ever built by Nazi Germany and any European power.
*Her remodel art is based from the '[[Wikipedia:Operation Rheinübung|Operation Rheinübung]]', where she is repainted on her way to Norway. Her 2nd remodel is again also based from the operation, this time after departing from Norway and into the Atlantic.
*Named after German chancellor, [[Wikipedia:Otto von Bismarck|Otto von Bismarck]].
*Her wreck was discovered in 1989 by [[wikipedia:Robert Ballard|Dr. Robert Ballard]].
* Received her second upgrade on 23/04/2014, together with Tone and Chikuma
* Received third upgrade on 26/09/2014. Aside from overall stat boost, she became the only allied Battleship able to launch torpedoes.
** If you count enemy fleet, [[Battleship Re-Class]] is the 1st battleship that can launch torpedoes in-game.
** Those torpedo tubes are actually cribbed from ''Tirpitz'', which was equipped with torpedoes.
