==Introduction==
'''KanColle Style''' '''(艦これスタイル)''' is a Japanese information / Guide Book that is released as a mook across Japan as a continuation series of the previous guide book series '''Life at the Naval Base''' (鎮守府生活のすゝめ).

Just like its previous counterpart, the book serves as a main guide book for players and fans alike to learn the latest information about the Kantai Collection browser game including detailed tips, strategies and information regarding what players can do within the game. But unlike '''Life at the Naval Base''', the mook further explores features of the KanColle franchise such as the [[Kancolle Arcade]], [[Merchandise/KanColle Kai|KanColle Kai]], merchandise figures, public events and even interviews with Kensuke Tanaka and various seiyuu regarding their experience with Kantai Collection and other matters. In addition, they also give out bonus items for purchasing the books.

Like most mooks, they are usually published for a longer period of time and are more readily available compared to magazines.
