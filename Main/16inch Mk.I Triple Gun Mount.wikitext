==Introduction==
紅茶の国で建造されたビックセブン、条約下時代に建造された16inch砲搭載超弩級戦艦ネルソン級。その主兵装として、同艦前部に集中配備された大口径三連装戦艦主砲です。課題を残しつつも、本三連装主砲三基九門を全て艦前部に集中配備した野心的な艦形を持つネルソン級は、日本の長門、そして陸奥と並んで、ビックセブンの一角を構成しました。

''The Nelson-class was a class of super-dreadnoughts that were built with 16 inch guns in the land of black tea as part of the Big Seven under the naval treaty. These large-caliber triple battleship guns were used as their main armament and carried entirely in the front. While it wasn't without its problems, the Nelson-class, with its ambitious design of three of these main batteries, for a total of nine barrels, all concentrated north of the bridge, were part of the Big Seven alongside Japan's Nagato and Mutsu.''
