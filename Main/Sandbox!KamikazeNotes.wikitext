===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''

: She has below average firepower and torpedo that makes her a poor combatant. She does have good base ASW that allows her to hit OASW more easily compared to other destroyers. However, her low defensive stats make her a liability. She is cheap to run and makes a good candidate for expeditions.
