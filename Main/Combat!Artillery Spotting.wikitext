=Introduction=

Artillery Spotting, commonly referred to as ''ArtySpot'', ''Daytime CI'', or simply ''Spotting'', is a series of special attacks that allow ships with specific equipment setups to perform Cut-in attacks during the Day Battle. These attacks grant '''post-cap''' damage bonuses as well as increased shelling accuracy.

The Carrier-equivalent for Artillery Spotting is '''Aircraft Carrier Cut-in (CVCI)'''. Mechanically, they share the same core mechanics, but have different trigger conditions.

=Artillery Spotting=

Artillery Spotting is a feature for ships that can launch {{Seaplane}}Recon planes. Using special equipment setups, those ships may perform one of multiple special attacks. These attacks are often referred to as Cut-ins due to the way the equipment is displayed in the screen before the attacks are performed. Particular Cut-ins are often referred to by their acronym, such as APCI for Main AP Shell Cut-in, Sec CI for Secondary Gun Cut-in, etc.

Cut-ins may be activated during a ship's turn and will override its normal shelling attack. Do note that the specific equipment being shown during the Cut-ins have no influence on the damage output.

==Trigger Conditions==
[[File:Air_Superiority_Aquired.png|thumb|right|The fleet attains Air Supremacy. Artillery Spotting and Aircraft Carrier Cut-ins can now be performed]]
* The fleet must have attained <span style="color:green;">'''Air Superiority (AS)'''</span> or <span style="color:green;">'''Air Supremacy (AS+)'''</span> Air State.
** For details on Air State, please refer to [[Aerial Combat#Stage 1 - Battle for Air Superiority|Aerial Combat - Stage 1]]
* The ship must be equipped with at least one {{Seaplane}}[[:Category:Reconnaissance Seaplane|Recon Seaplane]] or {{Seaplane}}[[:Category:Seaplane Bombers|Seaplane Bomber]] on a slot with size '''higher than 0'''.
** {{SeaplaneFighter}}Seaplane Fighters '''do not''' enable Artillery Spotting.
** '''Main Suisei Cut-in''' specifically ignores this condition.
* The ship must be equipped with at least one {{RedGunHeavy}}{{RedGunMedium}}{{RedGunLight}}{{GreenGunDP}}'''main gun'''.
* The ship must target another ship and attack it with Surface Shelling.
** ASW shelling has no Artillery Spotting setups.
* The ship must not be <span style="color:red;">'''Heavily damaged {{Nihongo|(大破)|''Taiha''}}'''</span>.

==Setups and Attack Types==
[[File:Main_Main_Cutin.png|thumb|right|Musashi performing Main AP Shell Cut-in (APCI)]]
Different setups have different conditions, trigger rates, damage, and number of hits. Cut-ins are determined by the attack's prerequisites as well as the previously state trigger conditions.

For a given Cut-in, any other equipment can be added on the remaining slots. Be wary that adding certain equipment may change the Cut-in you would be rolling for. If your setup fulfils multiple prerequisites, the Cut-ins will be rolled from top to bottom.

* For clarity purposes, {{RedGunHeavy}} is used to indicate ''any'' '''Main Gun'''.
* {{Seaplane}} is used to indicate a '''Recon or Seaplane Bomber'''.
* {{YellowGun}}{{GreenGunDP}} is used to indicate a '''Secondary Gun'''.
** Note that small caliber {{GreenGunDP}} such as {{EquipmentLink|10cm Twin High-angle Gun Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director|text=10cm Twin High-angle Gun + AAFD}} and {{EquipmentLink|5inch Single Gun Mount Mk.30|text=5in Single Gun Mk.30}}, as well as Atlanta's {{EquipmentLink|5inch Twin Dual-purpose Gun Mount (Concentrated Deployment)|text=5in Twin Dual-purpose Gun Mount (CD)}} are not Secondary but Main Guns.
* {{ZuiunPlane}} is a custom icon used to indicate any '''Zuiun''' and its variants.
* {{DiveBomb icon}} is used to indicate any '''Suisei with (634 Air Group)''' in its name.

If all rolls fail or the ship meets no Cut-in requirements, then it'll perform a Single Attack: a default 1 hit, no damage modifier shelling attack.

=Aircraft Carrier Cut-in=

Aircraft Carrier Cut-in, or CVCI for short, is a feature for ships that can launch {{BluePlane}}{{DiveBomb icon}}{{GreenPlane}}Carrier-based planes. Similar to Artillery Spotting, using special equipment setups, those ships may perform one of multiple special attacks. 

CVCI may be activated during a ship's turn and will override its normal shelling attack.

==Trigger Conditions==

* The fleet must have attained <span style="color:green;">'''Air Superiority (AS)'''</span> or <span style="color:green;">'''Air Supremacy (AS+)'''</span> Air State.
** For details on Air State, please refer to [[Aerial Combat#Stage 1 - Battle for Air Superiority|Aerial Combat - Stage 1]]
* The carrier must fulfil one of the equipment setups.
* The carrier must be shelling a '''surface ship'''.
** Installations cannot be attacked by CVCI.

* {{BluePlane}} is used to indicate a '''Torpedo Bomber'''. In the game, is referred to as ''Attacker''.

If all rolls fail or the ship meets no Cut-in requirements, then it'll perform a Single Attack: a default 1 hit, no damage modifier shelling attack.

'''Note:''' The Critical Damage modifier granted by Aircraft Proficiency works differently when performing a CVCI.
* Planes may be equipped in any order, but the plane in the First Slot is denominated the '''Captain''' (regardless of plane type), and grants bonuses based on whether or not it is present in the cut-in being performed.
** '''0.15''' if the Captain is participating, 0 otherwise.
* Instead of adding the Aircraft Proficiency's Critical Damage modifiers, the average Critical Damage modifier of the participating planes is used instead.
** 0 for no proficiency, up to '''~0.106''' if all participating planes are '''Double Chevron<span style="color: #909010;"> ❱❱'''</span>

The final Critical Damage modifier is given by:

<math>\text{Critical}_\text{mod} = 1.5 \times \left(1 + \text{Proficiency}_\text{average bonus} + \text{Captain}_\text{bonus} \right)</math>

With a maximum value of ~1.884 (1.5 x ~1.256).

=Trigger Rates=

Artillery Spotting and Aircraft Carrier Cut-ins share the same trigger rate formula. The chance of successfully rolling a Cut-in and performing the attack is given by:

<math>\text{CI %} = \left[ \dfrac{\text{Base}_\text{ship}}{\text{Base}_\text{attack}} \right] \times 100</math>

Where:

<math>\text{Base}_\text{ship} = \left \lfloor 
10 +  \lfloor\sqrt{\text{Luck}} \rfloor + \text{AirState}_\text{1} + \text{Flagship}_\text{mod} 
+
\left \lfloor 
\left(
\text{Fleet}_\text{LoS} + \text{AirState}_\text{2} \times \text{Ship}_\text{LoS}
\right)
\right \rfloor \times \text{AirState}_\text{3}
\right \rfloor 
</math>

* <math>\text{AirState}_\text{1}</math> is the 1st Air State modifier.
** Assumes 10 for AS+, 0 for AS.
* <math>\text{AirState}_\text{2}</math> is the 2nd Air State modifier.
** Assumes 1.6 for AS+, 1.2 for AS.
* <math>\text{AirState}_\text{3}</math> is the 3rd Air State modifier.
** Assumes 0.7 for AS+, 0.6 for AS.
* <math>\text{Flagship}_\text{mod}</math> is the flagship modifier.
** Assumes 15 if the ship is the flagship, 0 otherwise.
* <math>\text{Ship}_\text{LoS}</math> is the sum of the ship equipment's displayed LoS value.
* <math>\text{Fleet}_\text{LoS}</math> is given by the following formula:

<math>\text{Fleet}_\text{LoS} = \left \lfloor \sqrt{\text{Total}_\text{LoS}} + \frac{\text{Total}_\text{LoS}}{10} \right \rfloor</math>

Where <math>\text{Total}_\text{LoS} = \sum^{\text{All ships}}\text{Base}_\text{LoS} + \sum^{\text{All Recons/Bombers}}\text{Equip}_\text{LoS} \times \lfloor\sqrt{\text{SlotSize}}\rfloor</math>

* <math>\text{Base}_\text{LoS}</math> is the ship's base LoS value without any equipment.
* <math>\text{Equip}_\text{LoS}</math> is the equipment's displayed LoS value.

<math>\text{Base}_\text{attack}</math> is the Value used by each type of Cut-in:
