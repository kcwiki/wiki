==Personal considerations==
*Adding locations for sub/transport/CV(V) sinking to this page, and consequently renaming it.
:Wouldn't this be more for quest farming as opposed to leveling? [[User:Remi Scarlet|Remi Scarlet]] ([[User talk:Remi Scarlet|talk]]) 00:33, 16 May 2015 (UTC)
::I was considering repurposing the page to include leveling and quest farming, but at the moment, yeah, I'm leaning towards a dedicated leveling page.[[User:Wsewolod|Wsewolod]] ([[User talk:Wsewolod|talk]]) 00:39, 16 May 2015 (UTC)
*Trying possibly untapped leveling locations, through testing or from Japanese blogs/databases.
:As a note, I'd be willing to test some locations out myself [[User:Remi Scarlet|Remi Scarlet]] ([[User talk:Remi Scarlet|talk]]) 00:33, 16 May 2015 (UTC)

===Reasons for revamping===
*I don't like how the templates are done, especially with 9 of them existing. 
*A lot of the setups simply aren't ideal/optimal, and were probably put up because they were popular rather than efficient; an example being the use of CLT in 5-4, which isn't helpful from experienced admirals I've read from and from personal experience.
*3-3-A IS MISSING. It provides more experience than 3-2-A for the same fuel cost in addition to a chance at Mutsu and Shimakaze, with the only drawback being an elite CA in one out of the three possible enemy fleet compositions. 
:I thought the reason why people did 3-2-A was because of the general assurance of little to no damage due to the lack of the elite CA, which '''can''' actually hurt your ships. This is especially so when you consider that most people sweatshop 3-2-A, eg your ships have shit evasion to begin with since everyone except the flagship is at red morale.

::I've read a lot of people do 3-2-A over 5-4-A for that reason, but I think 3-3 is definitely worth mentioning.[[User:Wsewolod|Wsewolod]] ([[User talk:Wsewolod|talk]]) 00:39, 16 May 2015 (UTC)

*1-5; ideal for leveling DD/CL inexpensively and safely below HQ80.
*3-2-A; the standard farming spot for heavy ships without risk of damage.
*4-3; the standard farming spot for DD/CL past HQ80, boasting rapid experience gain and low morale drain but presenting bucket usage and lots of scratch damage.
*5-4-A; the other standard farming spot for heavy ships, boasting significantly higher experience but also the risk of damage from CA and CVL in certain compositions; the bauxite consumption is also a bit higher than 3-2-A.
*5-4-Full; a way to level heavy ships (Potentially lighter ones as well) with less concern over morale drain. This method excels in leveling CA due to its high base exp. 

As with any page, suggestions and direct contributions are welcome.

==Light Ships==
''(Periodically throwing stuff on here to see how it looks; I have every intention of putting the sortie maps into templates, though.)''<br />
As experience gain is largely dependent on flagships achieving MVP, destroyers and light cruisers need special attention. Their meager firepower means that they will have to sortie alongside ships with even less output; this is achieved in maps with submarines, where Line Abreast moderates heavy ship damage while bolstering ASW capability. The following are the most remarkable, efficient places to level such ships:

This is the standard leveling ground for destroyers and light cruisers when your HQ level is below 80.
