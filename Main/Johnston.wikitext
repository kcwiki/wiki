===Analysis===
Priority: '''Medium-High'''
:An US destroyer with mediocre Torpedo, decent Firepower, and great AA, ASW and HP stats.
:She can perform OASW easily, and once remodeled she gains the ability to execute said attack innately, albeit it won't do much damage unless she has actual ASW gear on her.

:She also comes with an array of powerful Fletcher-class [[Anti-Air Cut-In]] attacks and the possibility (unique to US light ships so far) to perform multiple rolls for those instead of just one, making her a reliable choice for the fleet's air defense. 
:(Do note that her AACI requires two [[5inch Naval Gun Mk.30 Kai + GFCS Mk.37]] to bring out her full potential.) 
:Finally, a decent base Luck of 40 allows for mildly reliable cut-in attacks at night. However, her stat distributions means said attacks will not be able to hit hard.

:No further remodels have been implemented for her yet (as of January 2020).


====Recommended Roles====
* ASW

==Trivia==
* She is named after Lieutenant [[wikipedia:John_V._Johnston|John V. Johnston]], a Civil War commander.
* USS ''Johnston'' earned 6 battle stars and, for the Battle off Samar, a Presidential Unit Citation. Her character has two stars on her collar, one bronze and one silver - the silver one represents 5 battle stars.
* The signal flags at the end of her hair ribbons correspond to her radio call sign, '''NIKZ'''.
* The medal slung over her left arm is the Medal of Honor awarded posthumously to Evans. The full citation is as follows:
** For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as commanding officer of the U.S.S. ''Johnston'' in action against major units of the enemy Japanese fleet during the battle off Samar on 25 October 1944. The first to lay a smokescreen and to open fire as an enemy task force, vastly superior in number, firepower and armor, rapidly approached. Comdr. Evans gallantly diverted the powerful blasts of hostile guns from the lightly armed and armored carriers under his protection, launching the first torpedo attack when the ''Johnston'' came under straddling Japanese shellfire. Undaunted by damage sustained under the terrific volume of fire, he unhesitatingly joined others of his group to provide fire support during subsequent torpedo attacks against the Japanese and, outshooting and outmaneuvering the enemy as he consistently interposed his vessel between the hostile fleet units and our carriers despite the crippling loss of engine power and communications with steering aft, shifted command to the fantail, shouted steering orders through an open hatch to men turning the rudder by hand and battled furiously until the ''Johnston'', burning and shuddering from a mortal blow, lay dead in the water after 3 hours of fierce combat. Seriously wounded early in the engagement, Comdr. Evans, by his indomitable courage and brilliant professional skill, aided materially in turning back the enemy during a critical phase of the action. His valiant fighting spirit throughout this historic battle will venture as an inspiration to all who served with him.
** His gunnery officer Bob Hagen stated: "The skipper was a fighting man from the soles of his broad feet to the ends of his straight black hair. He was an Oklahoman and proud of the Indian blood he had in him. We called him-though not to his face-the Chief. The ''Johnston'' was a fighting ship, but he was the heart and soul of her.
