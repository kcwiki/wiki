==Helping Out Mamiya with the Okazari Materials==
Mamiya is looking to make produce an Okazari for the New Year. In order to do so, your fleet needs to go out of the way to locate Okazari Materials for her. [[File:Okazari.png|right]]

''Okazari'' are a Japanese wreath decoration that are commonly put out on display during the Japanese New Year. They commonly symbolize a healthy, long life.[http://www.thejapanguy.com/do-you-know-these-14-famous-japanese-new-year-traditions/]

To locate the Okazari Materials will need to sortie to various maps. Upon scoring an '''A or S rank''' (depending on the location) you might be rewarded with Okazari Materials.

To help increase your chances of finding them you may want to equip your fleet with [[Searchlight]]s [[File:Searchlight.png]] and [[Skilled Lookouts]] [[File:Ssp_c.png]].
