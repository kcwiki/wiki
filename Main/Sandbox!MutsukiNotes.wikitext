===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''
: She has below average combat power that makes her unsuitable for sorties. Her one saving grace is that she is cheap to run, meaning she is a good choice for minmaxing expedition gains.
: She gains better combat stats with her Kai Ni but it only brings her in line with an average destroyer. She is still not suited for sorties, especially considering the effort involved in remodelling her. She does gain the ability to equip daihatsu which allows her to excel even further in her expedition role.

===Analysis===
Priority:
* Kai: '''Low'''
: She has below average combat power that makes her unsuitable for sorties. Her one saving grace is that she is cheap to run, meaning she is a good choice for minmaxing expedition gains.

* Kai Ni: '''Medium'''
: She gains better combat stats with her Kai Ni but it only brings her in line with an average destroyer. She is still not suited for sorties, especially considering the effort involved in remodelling her. She does gain the ability to equip daihatsu which allows her to excel even further in her expedition role. In addition to this, she can also equip Ka-Mi tanks that allow her to perform an anti-installation role. Although she is still the weakest of all the Ka-Mi capable destroyers, she will work if you have no other choice. Her special AACI has a low fixed shootdown and weak multiplier, making it a bad choice to run.

====Reccommended Roles====
* Expeditions
* Anti-installation

====Not Reccommended Roles====
* Combat
* Anti-air

* Required for A49, A66, A79, B39, B60, B72, and B104. <Satsuki>
