==Introduction==
零戦の最終的な量産機となった改良型、「零式艦上戦闘機52型」です。<br>
後継機の開発が遅れたため、零戦52型が後期の主力艦上戦闘機として奮戦することになりました。<br>
「彗星」艦爆や「天山」艦攻と一緒に、機動部隊の主力として運用してくださいね。

''The final mass-production version of the [[Type 21 Zero Fighter|Zero-fighter]], "Type Zero Carrier-based Fighter Type 52".<br>
As the development of its sucessors were delayed, the Zero-fighter Type 52 fought bravely as the main late-war carrier-based fighter.<br>
Along with the "[[Suisei (Comet)|Suisei]]" bomber and "[[Tenzan (Heavenly Mountain)|Tenzan]]" torpedo bomber, please use it as your mainstay air task-force.''
==Notes==
Buildable. Stock equipment of all remodelled CVs and CVLs except for [[Taihou]] and [[Unryuu]].

== Historical Information ==
The '''Mitsubishi A6M5 ''Zero''''' (''Type 0 Carrier-based fighter, Model 52'', Allied reporting name "Zeke") is the final mass-production (and perhaps most effective) variant of the Mitsubishi A6M.

Compared to the A6M2, the A6M5 had shorter wings and revised control surfaces while an improved exhaust system and cowling increased power delivery. Carbon-dioxide based fire extuinguishers were added while the radio was updated. The A6M5 had a number of incremental updates throughout its various manufacturing lots.

Maximum speed was increased to 565km/h at 6,000m and it could reach that altitude in just over 7 minutes. Subvariants include the [[Zero Fighter Type 52 Type C (601 Air Group)|A6M5c]], while the A6M6 and [[Type 62 Zero Fighter-bomber|A6M7 (Model 62)]] were adapted from the A6M5.
