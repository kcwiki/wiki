==Introduction==
パスタの国が生んだ三連装型の戦艦主砲です。
高射速の50口径、中近距離戦闘での火力は同クラス最強です。
また、射程も大和型46cm砲と同等以上のカタログスペックを誇ります。
砲の耐久性や命中率にも課題を残していましが、改修によってその命中精度などが向上しています。

This triple barreled cannon was one of the main cannons used in the land of the pastas by battleships. Boasting a fast-firing 50 caliber barrel, it was considered to have some of the highest fire power among mid-range combat equipment. As for firepower, it's very similar to the Yamato Class 46cm cannons, and holds its rankings among them. Some of the main problems were its accuracy and durability, but with modernization its accuracy has been improved over time.
