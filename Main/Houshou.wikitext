N/A

===Overview===
* Low firepower, HP and armour.
* Very low plane count.
* Bad slot distribution

===Fit Bonuses===

{{clear}}

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''

: She has low firepower and plane count along with bad slot sizes. Having only 3 equipment slots is another mark against her. She is also slow which means she will have problems with speed restrictions. Although she is very common and cheap to run, her limited effectiveness in sorties means you're better off bringing any other carrier.

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Air Support
* Support Expedition

===Important Info===
* Required for quests F22 and F35

{{#invoke:ShipDropTable|returnShipDrop|Houshou}}

==Trivia==
*Her name literally translates as "phoenix in flight" (鳳=phoenix, 翔=soar/fly)
*Due to her comments regarding opening a little store with the admiral, JP players often refer to her as <span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Arial,宋体;line-height:24px;">おかみさん</span> (Okami-san, lit. "boss lady" or the female owner of a typical Japanese store).
*Her arrows have orange-yellow fletching as apposed to the white and green arrow fletching of other carriers, this is a reference to her role as a training carrier as the IJN painted its training aircraft a bright yellow or orange
*She was the first purpose-built aircraft carrier to be launched. This, combined with her manner of speaking, has led her to be characterised as the mother of the other carriers.
* The original Houshou appeared in the animated movie "The Wind Rises", the aircraft carrier visited by Horikoshi Jiro and his supervisor Kurokawa. Nagato, with the serpentine funnel unique to her class, was shown as well, albeit briefly.
