==Introduction==
条約下で保有数に制限のあった重巡を、火力を増強した強力な軽巡で補うために開発されました。<br>
初の三連装砲でしたが、射程・発射速度・運用面全てに高い評価を得ることになりました。<br>
後に有名な「大和」型戦艦の副砲としても採用されています。<br>
対空戦にも効果を発揮する傑作砲です。

''To cover the shortfall of heavy cruisers that were limited by the Treaty, this gun was developed to produce powerful light cruisers.<br> It was the first 3-gun turret with excellent range, fire rate and operability. <br> It was later adopted as the secondary guns of the Yamato-class battleships. <br> It is a masterpiece that can also be used for anti-air.''

Equipped by Mogami-class cruisers before they were converted into heavy cruisers by swapping their gun into [[20.3cm Twin Gun Mount|20.3cm]] turrets. Apparently Mogami-class was designed as a heavy cruiser, but the naval treaty at the time defined cruiser types with main gun caliber so it is a sort of regulation loophole. The other ships that also equip this are the Yamato-class Battleship and the Oyodo-class Light Cruiser

==Note==
* Buildable; Stock Equipment of [[Mogami]] and [[Ooyodo]]
* Can be upgraded in [[Akashi's Improvement Arsenal]] using [[Mogami]] as the 2nd slot ship.
