:While she's not impressive in combat, her excellent luck means she can use night cut-in attacks reliably.

'''Dan Yang''' 

Priority: '''Medium-Low'''
:This intermediate remodel turns her into a firepower-focused destroyer belonging to the island nation of Taiwan.
:With the proper gear, she can reach a whopping 95 Firepower, rivaling heavy cruisers, although her Torpedo stat decreases significantly, so her overall night battle potential doesn't improve.
:Her AA also goes up.
:Keep in mind that this remodel requires a [[Blueprint]].

'''Yukikaze Kai Ni'''

Priority: '''Medium'''

:Yukikaze's true second remodel is a sight to behold.
:On top of Dan Yang's great firepower, she gains an excellent torpedo stat, which topped with a ridiculous 63 Luck and impressive equipment bonuses makes her outright superb in night battle, hitting on par with the strong cruisers with both double attacks and cut-ins.
:Oh, and on top of that she has now enough ASW to perform opening ASW attacks with proper gear, too.
:Still not enough? She gains the ability to equip a [[Fleet Command Facility]] and amphibious tanks, making her able to shine during amphibious operations as well.

:Her ASW stat also allow her to perform OASW attacks with proper setup.

'''Isuzu Kai Ni'''
Priority: '''Medium-Low'''
:Her second remodel actually ''decreases'' her anti-surface capabilities, granting her an AA stat boost but especially the best ASW stat of any light cruiser in game and the ability to execute said attack innately, albeit it won't do much damage unless she has actual ASW gear on her.
:As such, she's a natural choice to deal with enemy submarines.
:She also gain her own [[Anti-Air Cut-In]] setups, but those aren't really worth using over the genertic onces in almost any case.

====Recommended Roles====
* ASW
* Anti-air (Second remodel)

:Her ASW stat also allow her to perform OASW attacks with proper setup.

'''Yura Kai Ni'''

Priority: '''Medium-High'''
:Her second remodel increases her AA stat, and also gives her exceptional versatility, as she can now equip seaplane fighters, tanks, [[Daihatsu]] ''and'' midget submarines.
:This means she can perform almost any role in addition to the typical ASW role of any light cruiser, using midget submarines to perform a preemptive torpedo strike like a CLT while still being classified as a CL, increasing expedition income, helping achieve air superiority or attacking enemy installations as alternatives to her anti-surface role.
:Oh, and in addition to all this she gets her own [[Anti-Air Cut-In]] setup, which isn't weak but effectively requires using a [[Reinforcement Expansion]] on her and placing an [[8cm Twin High-angle Mount + Additional Machine Guns]] in the resulting slot not to gimp her too much unless a pure AA role is desired.
:The expression "jack of all trades, master of none" comes to mind: while she's not a specialized ship, the flexibility she brings to the fleet is immense.
:Take note that this remodel requires a [[Blueprint]].

'''Ooi Kai'''

Priority: '''Very High'''

:Her first remodel reclassifies her as a ''Torpedo Cruiser'' (CLT), meaning she will not be counted as a light cruiser for combined fleet, map routing, and the like.
:In exchange for this, her Torpedo stat goes up and she can now be loaded with midget submarines, allowing her to perform submarine-like preemptive torpedo attacks, meaning she gets to hit the enemy fleet before shelling begins, potentially removing an abyssal ship instantly.
:Do note that she can't perform anything but basic attacks in night battle at this stage, since she has only two slots and the midget submarine does not count as a torpedo.

'''Ooi Kai Ni'''

Priority: '''Very High'''

:Remodeled again, Ooi-chi really gets to shine now.
:Getting a third slot means she's now a force to be reckoned with in night battle too, and a stellar 139 Torpedo stat makes her opening torpedo much more lethal.
:Her base Luck is just 13, meaning that cut-in attacks at night are not an option for her unlike her sister [[Kitakami]], albeit experienced admirals can definitely invest to increase her Luck further.
:On top of this, her ASW stat goes up too, meaning that at high levels she can perform both OASW and opening torpedo. Oh, and she comes with a [[61cm Quint (Oxygen) Torpedo Mount]] too.
:What's there not to like?

:Just like aviation cruisers, she can attack enemy submarines with proper equipment, but she is generally a very poor choice for this role. 
:However, she has lower firepower than her "non-aviation" counterparts, and is in fact on the level of heavy cruisers.

:Do note that, while aviation cruisers can attack enemy submarines with proper equipment, they are generally a very poor choice for this role.

:Keep in mind that this remodel requires a [[Blueprint]].

====Recommended Roles====
* Surface combat
* Night battle 
* Air superiority (second remodel)

====Not Recommended Roles====
* ASW

==[[Chikuma]]==

'''Chikuma Kai'''

Priority: '''Medium-High'''

:At first remodel, she has decent Firepower and an okay Torpedo stat, making her suited for daytime surface combat thanks to [[Artillery Spotting]] and useful in night battle too.

'''Chikuma Kai Ni'''  

Priority: '''Medium-High'''
:Her second can be remodeled into an aviation cruiser (CAV) which allows her to carry seaplane bombers and, much more importantly, fighters.

====Not Recommended Roles====
* ASW

==[[Shouhou]]==

Priority: '''Low'''

: She has low firepower for a light carrier which limits her damage potential. Her evenly distributed slots are not very good because they are all on the small side. Her slot sizes are also mostly on the small side which limits her damage potential even further.

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Air Support
* Shelling Support
* Airstrike Support

==[[Hiyou]]==

Priority: '''Low'''

: She has low firepower for a light carrier which limits her damage potential. Her evenly distributed slots are not good but workable because they are all on the small side. This means her airstrike power isn't that good but it also means she can easily spread her damage more evenly against more targets. She'll work just fine for airstrikes against soft targets.

====Recommended Roles====
* Air Support
* Airstrike Support

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Shelling Support

==[[Ryuujou]]==

* Kai: '''Low'''
: She has low firepower and plane count combined with a terrible slot distribution. Her single large slot isn't enough to make up for the rest of her slots being very small. Being the 2nd slot, it also means she can lose the plane proficiency bonus or artillery spotting easily. Her slots don't allow her to do much than be a fighter mule.

* Kai Ni: '''Medium'''
: She gains a significant improvement to her firepower and plane count. Her slot distribution also improves a bit with the top slot increasing in size. It's still risky to bring her against heavy anti-air but her slots are usable now. Her slot setup allows her to bring both a decent airstrike and fighter power to sorties.

==[[Ise]]==

'''Ise Kai'''

Priority: '''High'''

:Upon remodel, she turns into an aviation battleship (BBV), which is to a standard battleship what a CAV is to a CA, and thus able to embark seaplane bombers and, much more importantly, fighters.
:This makes her obviously valuable to contest control of the air: however, her slot distribution makes her poorly suited for bombing.
:Just like aviation cruisers, she can attack enemy submarines with proper equipment, but she is generally a very poor choice for this role. 
:However, she has lower firepower than her "non-aviation" counterparts, and is in fact on the level of heavy cruisers.
:This is a very early, cheap remodel that becomes more important as soon as [[Akashi]] is added to the fleet if one wants to develop [[12cm 30 Tube Rocket Launcher Kai 2]]. 

'''Ise Kai Ni'''

Priority: '''Very High''' if you do not have her sister's second remodel, otherwise '''High'''.

:This second remodel isn't good. It's ''very'' good.
:First, she is the only battleship in game besides [[Musashi]]'s second remodel to have five equipment slots, and you don't mind me to tell you good that is, right?
:Second, she can trigger ''full immunity to airstrike damage'' with a very high chance by equipping the aforementioned rocket launcher, which is also pretty ridiculous.
:Third, she goes beyond seaplane and can now load fixed-wing fighters and dive bombers, essentially giving you a full carrier-battleship hybrid with incredible flexibility.
:Oh, and her plane slots are great, even better than her sister's.
:The age of aviation is truly here.
:However, her Firepower is still below standard battleships, and keep in mind that this remodel requires 2 [[Blueprint]] and a catapult.

====Recommended Roles====
* Surface combat

==[[Kongou]]==

'''Kongou Kai'''

Priority: '''High''', unless many more fast battleships are available.

:A Japanese fast battleship that's easy to come across for her class.
:Her stats are decent but nothing to write home about.

'''Kongou Kai Ni'''

Priority: '''Low'''

:This second remodel improves her stats a bit and that's it.
:There's no reason not to take it but no reason to rush it either, generally.

'''Kongou Kai Ni C'''  

Priority: '''Low'''
:This further remodel comes with a torpedo fitting, allowing her to equip torpedoes and perform closing salvos like cruisers or destroyers, and also increasing her night battle potential. 
:She also unlock a special night battle combined attack, which further underscores her new niche.
:Keep in mind that this remodel requires 2 [[Blueprint]]s.

====Recommended Roles====

==[[Nagato]]==

Priority: 

* Kai: '''High'''
: Being obtainable from normal construction and having a low remodel level makes her a valuable part of the fleet. Her high firepower, armour and HP will make her a mainstay until you obtain the LSC or event-only battleships. Although she can carry seaplane fighters, she needs to compromise her combat ability to do so.
* Kai Ni: '''Medium-High'''
: Your first Kai Ni between [[Nagato]] and [[Mutsu]] should be a priority because of their powerful skill. Ideally Nagato herself due to quest prequisites. Aside from that, she gains a significant boost to her firepower and armour. Her ability to equip daihatsu also gives her potential in the anti-installation role. Though her performace against surface targets will suffer. Her blueprint requirement and high remodel level makes her take a back seat to other battleships if you already have Mutsu at Kai Ni.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Anti-Installation - Kai Ni
* Support Expeditions

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Air Support

===Important Info===
* Required for quests A42, A74, B31, and B99.

==[[Akagi]]==

Priority: 

* Kai: '''Medium'''
: She will likely be the first carrier that you come across because she is a quest reward. Her important stats being slightly better than average means she will serve you well as an early carrier. Her good slot count is let down by her less than ideal slot distribution. The two medium slots being only 20 and positioned on top means she risks getting them emptied when facing heavy enemy anti-air. In that situation, she can lose her ability to perform artillery spotting and plane proficiency bonuses. 

* Kai Ni: '''Low'''
: She doesn't really improve much slot-wise at Kai Ni. However, she does gain a 5th slot that gives her incredible flexibility. She can easily find room for recon planes to help LoS or other utility equipment like radar for routing in events. She can also contribute a lot more fighter support than other carriers while still maintaining strike power. Her increase to firepower is also another welcome buff. However, her remodel is expensive and not worth the cost for most players. Her Kai Ni is strictly a late-game upgrade.

* Kai Ni E: '''Low'''
: Her top two slots actually get worse at Kai Ni E. The slots are quite small and will be prone to getting emptied by heavy enemy anti-air. She is a powerful night carrier that can hit the night battle cap with ease while still maintaining strike power during the day. That said, her niche role means it is better to keep her in her Kai Ni form unless you have the night planes required to make her useful.

* Kai Ni Go: '''Low'''
: Her slots get neutered and will be prone to getting emptied by heavy enemy anti-air. The ability to perform (O)ASW can be useful in some situations, but can impede her ability to conduct surface combat quite a bit since she prioritizes targeting submarines. Her Jet capabilities are nothing to write home about as she lacks the slot size to actually make them hit hard and survive reliably in heavy AA maps. That said, her niche role means it is better to keep her in her Kai Ni form unless you have the night planes required to make her useful in Kai 2 E form.

==[[Houshou]]==

Priority: '''Low'''

: She has low firepower and plane count along with bad slot sizes. Having only 3 equipment slots is another mark against her. She is also slow which means she will have problems with speed restrictions. Although she is very common and cheap to run, her limited effectiveness in sorties means you're better off bringing any other carrier.

==[[Souryuu]]==

Priority: '''High'''
: She is a below average CV in her kai form. Her only saving grace is that she is cheap to run. Her 18 slots are small and liable to be emptied by heavy enemy anti-air. This can compromise her ability to take advantage of plane proficiency bonuses and artillery spot. 
: Her Kai Ni has a low remodel level and is cheap. When combined with her above good firepower, it makes her a decent carrier. She is still let down by her slot distribution because her top slot is still 18. She does get a buff to her large slot which gives her a harder hitting airstrike.

:However, she can be remodeled further to fill a different niche in the fleet, which should be preferable for admirals not short of anti-surface destroyers, so giving up this version to obtain the D one is a real possibility.
:Another option, for those willing to do so, is to raise a second Asashio as she doesn't need a [[Blueprint]] or [[Action Report]] to be remodeled.

'''Asashio Kai Ni D'''  

Priority: '''Very High'''
:A further remodel decreases her anti-surface capabilities by reducing her Firepower and Torpedo stat a bit, trading those off for the best ASW stat of all IJN destroyers currently in game and immediately perform OASW, plus the ability to load [[Daihatsu]] and tanks, allowing her to increase expedition income or be deployed against enemy installations.

:Her ASW stat also allow her to perform OASW attacks with proper setup.

'''Kuma Kai Ni'''

Priority: '''Low-Medium'''

:On her second remodel, she has good Firepower and Torpedo stat for a light cruiser, meaning she can do [[Artillery Spotting]] with decent damage at day and packs a good punch at night, too.
:Her ASW stat also allow her to perform OASW attacks with proper setup.
:The main perk of this form is the ability to equip Seaplane Fighters which can help reach desired air-power levels. Slot sizes are too small to get any real use out of Seaplane Bombers.

'''Kuma Kai Ni D'''

Priority: '''Medium-High'''

:Her third remodel lowers her torpedo stat and a small amount of firepower which takes her back down to average in these areas.
:She makes up for these stat losses by gaining the ability to equip mini-subs to launch opening torpedo strikes.
:The ability to equip landing craft and tanks also helps her to deal with installation-type enemies.
:Her ASW stat is slightly increased, allowing her to perform OASW attacks a bit more easily.

'''Kiso Kai'''

Priority: '''Low'''

:At first remodel, she has decent Firepower and Torpedo stat for a light cruiser, meaning she can do [[Artillery Spotting]] with okay-ish damage at day and pack a decent punch at night, too.
:Her ASW stat also allow her to perform OASW attacks with proper setup.

'''Kiso Kai Ni'''

Priority: '''High'''

:Her second remodel reclassifies her as a ''Torpedo Cruiser'' (CLT), meaning she will not be counted as a light cruiser for combined fleet, map routing, and the like.
:In exchange for this, her Torpedo stat goes up and she can now be loaded with midget submarines, allowing her to perform submarine-like preemptive torpedo attacks, meaning she gets to hit the enemy fleet before shelling begins, potentially removing an abyssal ship instantly.
:Compared to her sister [[Kitakami]] and [[Ooi]], her Torpedo stat is "only" 110, which still beats any other ship in the game except those two, so she's still a very valuable addition to the fleet, even more so in events where [[Ship Locking]] is an issue.

====Recommended Roles====
* Surface combat
* ASW
* Night battle (Second remodel)

==[[Chitose]]==

* Seaplane Tender: '''High'''
: She is a very common seaplane tender. This is critical because she will be necessary for meeting routing requirements on certain maps. Other available seaplane tenders are either event, LSC or rare drops. Furthermore, she is fast which means she is unaffected by routing requirements. As for her combat ability, she has very low firepower which means she can't be counted on for shelling. The torpedo stat of her A remodel allows her to perform a respectable opening torpedo. Her plane count is on the low side but she has a large top slot. This allows her to bring along a seaplane bomber as long as you aren't facing heavy anti-air.

* Carrier: '''High'''
: The firepower of her carrier form is a bit on the low side. Her plane count does make up for it somewhat but her slot distribution lets her down. She gets a single large slot at the top that gives her good airstrike potential against a single target. The rest of her slots are quite small and risk being emptied when against heavy anti-air. Overall she is a decent shelling carrier.

==[[Chiyoda]]==

* Seaplane Tender: '''High'''
: She is a very common seaplane tender. This is critical because she will be necessary for meeting routing requirements on certain maps. Other available seaplane tenders are either event, LSC or rare drops. Furthermore, she is fast which means she is unaffected by routing requirements. As for her combat ability, she has very low firepower which means she can't be counted on for shelling. The torpedo stat of her A remodel allows her to perform a respectable opening torpedo. Her plane count is on the low side but she has a large top slot. This allows her to bring along a seaplane bomber as long as you aren't facing heavy anti-air.

==[[Shoukaku]]==

Priority:

* Kai: '''Medium'''
: Her Kai suffers from a lack of firepower which means she is lackluster at shelling. Her good plane count is somewhat let down by the even slot distribution but that makes her flexible since she can increase or decrease the amount of fighters or bombers she takes without compromising too much. This does make her a bit of a jack of all trades, master of none. 

* Kai Ni: '''Low'''
: Her Kai Ni improves upon everything her Kai can do but at a steep cost. It does bring a significant increase to her firepower which increases her combat ability. Now, she can do powerful shelling attacks in addition to her airstrikes.

* Kai Ni A: '''High'''
: Her Kai Ni A increases her firepower further and provides a significant upgrade to her slot distribution. She now gets a large top slot and a respectable 2nd slot that makes her even better at being a shelling carrier. She does lose her flexibility with her plane loadouts but that doesn't matter much. In addition, she also gains the ability to shell while moderately damaged. All this makes this remodel well worth the expense.

'''Kinu Kai'''

Priority: '''Low'''

:At first remodel, she has decent Firepower and Torpedo stat, for a light cruiser, meaning she can do [[Artillery Spotting]] with okay-ish damage at day and pack a decent punch at night, too.
:Her ASW stat also allow her to perform OASW attacks with proper setup.

'''Kinu Kai Ni'''

Priority: '''Medium-High'''
:Her second remodel increases her AA stats, but more importantly allows her to use tanks and [[Daihatsu]], meaning that she can now be used to increase expedition income or attack enemy installations.
:Furthermore, she comes with built-in resource collection bonus of "one Daihatsu's worth", meaning that she grants a +5% resource bonus (before cap) to expedition gains in addition to any Daihatsu she might be carrying.
:Similarly, she counts as carrying an extra Daihatsu during [[Transport Operation]]s, meaning an extra 8 TP off the gauge for S-rank victory.
:This bonus does not apply to anti-installation combat, however.
:She also gains two special [[Anti-Air Cut-In]] setup, one of which is interesting because merely requires a [[:Category:Special MG|special machine gun]] in her [[Reinforcement Expansion]] slot.
:Take note that this remodel requires a [[Blueprint]].

====Recommended Roles====

:Her ASW stat also allow her to perform OASW attacks with proper setup.

'''Abukuma Kai Ni'''

Priority: '''Very High'''
:Her second remodel grants her various stat boosts, particularly to her Torpedo stat, but more importantly allows her to use midget submarines to perform a preemptive torpedo strike like a CLT while still being classified as a CL, allowing her to be used where [[Kitakami]], [[Ooi]] and [[Kiso]] would not be allowed.
:She can also be loaded with tanks and [[Daihatsu]], making her a very versatile ship, to be used to increase expedition income or attack enemy installations as alternatives to her anti-surface role.
:Take note that this remodel requires a [[Blueprint]].

====Recommended Roles====
* ASW

* Surface combat (Second remodel)
* Anti-installation (Second remodel)

===Important Info===
* Required for A30, A54, A55, and B46.

==[[Yuubari]]==

'''Yuubari Kai'''

Priority: '''Medium'''

:A four slot light cruiser, who can't equip seaplanes and is therefore unable to perform [[Artillery Spotting]] but brings more flexibility than average to the fleet.
:For example, the extra slot allows her to perform powerful OASW attacks despite her ASW stat not being anything special, and turns her into an hard-hitting attacker against enemy installations when fitted with two [[WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)]].

'''Yuubari Kai Ni'''

Priority: '''Low'''

:An anti-air focused remodel, she gets a fifth slot, a big AA boost, the ability to carry large RADARs, and her own [[Anti-Air Cut-In]].
:Also, a base Luck stat of 30 allows for mildly reliable cut-in attacks at night.
:However, said AACI isn't worth using over the generic one, and she has access to further remodels which keep the excellent five slots but possess more interesting capabilities.
:This remodel, which is also required to proceed with the following ones, requires a [[Blueprint]] and an [[Action Report]].

'''Yuubari Kai Ni Toku'''

Priority: '''High'''

:Her second remodel increases her her Torpedo stat, but more importantly allows her to use midget submarines to perform a preemptive torpedo strike like a CLT while still being classified as a CL, allowing her to be used where [[Kitakami]], [[Ooi]] and [[Kiso]] would not be allowed.
:She can also be loaded with tanks and [[Daihatsu]], making her a very versatile ship, to be used to increase expedition income or making her even better at attacking enemy installations as alternatives to her anti-surface role.
:As a trade-off, she loses speed and is now classified as Slow, but isn't a big drawback as she has five slot and a single [[Improved Steam Turbine]] is enough to fix her speed if needed.
:Also, a base Luck stat of 30 allows for mildly reliable cut-in attacks at night.

'''Yuubari Kai Ni D'''

Priority: '''Medium-High'''

:Five slots, the ability to perform OASW attacks innately and equip large SONARs plus a good ASW stat boost make her the strongest anti-submarine ship in game so far, able to hit enemy subs like a truck by fully leveraging ASW synergy bonus and by simply having more slots.
:The only reason she's not listed as higher priority is that her above-mentioned Toku remodel also exists, albeit veteran Admirals might want to raise a second Yuubari.
:Also, a base Luck stat of 30 allows for mildly reliable cut-in attacks at night.

====Recommended Roles====
* ASW
* Anti-Installation
* Surface Combat (Second remodel Toku)
* Anti-Air (Second remodel)

===Important Info===
* Required for A50, B41, B140, B141 and Bq13.
* An option for BQ7.

==[[Zuihou]]==

* Kai: '''Low'''
: She has low firepower for a light carrier which limits her damage potential. Her evenly distributed slots are not very good because they are all on the small side. Her slot sizes are also mostly on the small side which limits her damage potential even further.

* Kai Ni: '''High'''
: She gains a significant increase in firepower and plane count that makes her work a lot better as a shelling carrier. Aside from the top slot, the rest of her slots remain on the small side which limits her airstrike potential. Being fast, it also means she isn't affected by speed restrictions.

* Kai Ni B: '''High'''
: She loses plane count in this remodel and her slot distribution becomes more even. This further limits her airstrike potential. It also means it's harder for her to be a shelling carrier since her slots are at risk of being emptied by heavy anti-air. She does gain the ability to perform OASW but her damage is limited by the inability to take advantage of synergy bonuses. The most significant change is her reclassification to "escort carrier" that means she can be included in a transport combined fleet. This allows her to bring significant air support in a fleet where you have limited options for the role.

====Recommended Roles====

==[[Mikuma]]==

'''Mikuma Kai'''

Priority: '''High'''

:This heavy cruiser can be remodeled into an aviation cruiser (CAV) which allows her to carry seaplane bombers and, much more importantly, fighters.
:Thus, while she isn't anything worth writing home about when it comes to surface combat, she can play an extremely important role when it comes to gaining air superiority.

:Do note that, while aviation cruisers can attack enemy submarines with proper equipment, they are generally a very poor choice for this role.

:No further remodels have been implemented for her yet (as of November 2020).

====Recommended Roles====

* She is a major source of [[20.3cm(no.3) Twin Gun Mount]].

==[[Maikaze]]==

Priority: '''Low'''

:At first remodel, she has low firepower and a decent torpedo stat, making her hitting harder in night battle than at day, but not great at either.
:While not impressive in combat, do keep in mind than many maps require you to bring at least a few destroyers for routing.
:Furthermore, destroyers are cheap to deploy and can equip [[Drum Canister]], making them suited for expeditions.

===Important Information===
* An option for C15 and C21.

==[[Kinugasa]]==

'''Kinugasa Kai'''

Priority: '''Low'''

:At first remodel, she has mediocre Firepower and a bad Torpedo stat, making her decent for daytime surface combat thanks to [[Artillery Spotting]] but poorly suited for night battle.
:On the other side, she consumes less fuel and ammo than most heavy cruisers.

'''Kinugasa Kai Ni'''  

Priority: '''Low'''
:Her second remodel increases her Firepower and Torpedo stat, meaning she hits harder than before at day and is actually useful at night, too.
:Leveraging her fit bonus by outfitting her with [[20.3cm(no.2) Twin Gun Mount]] further increases her capabilities, making her a fairly cost-effective ship.

====Recommended Roles====
* Surface combat

:Keep in mind that this remodel requires a [[Blueprint]].

'''Suzuya Kou Kai Ni'''  

Priority: '''Medium-Low'''
:This remodel turns her into a "fast attack" type of light carrier (CVL), and while this is theoretically a convertible remodel keep in mind that going from CAV to CVL requires a further [[Blueprint]] every time, making it a ''de facto'' permanent one.
:As carriers, she and her sister have a small air wing, but fast speed, great survivability for their ship category and the highest firepower available to a light carrier.
:This makes them hit very hard during daytime shelling, while sacrificing some bombing efficiency.
:Unlike other CVLs, she will target surface ships over submarines when both are present.

She is also very costly to run. Although she can carry seaplane fighters, she needs to compromise her combat ability to do so. Her AACI is also bad with a low fixed shootdown and multiplier.
: Her Kai Ni makes her the most powerful battleship in the game. Along with the significant boosts to her firepower, HP and armour; she gets 5 slots which give her incredible flexibility in her loadout. The 5th slot allows her to carry a seaplane fighter to assist with air support without sacrificing her combat ability. Her AACI has a good fixed shootdown and decent multiplier. However, it requires a secondary gun to activate, which can interfere with her artillery spotting and night battle attacks. It is an option to use in combined fleets where her night battle performance is irrelevant. All this comes at a very high cost which can be better spent elsewhere for newer admirals.

==[[Taihou]]==

Priority: '''Medium'''

: She has decent firepower but is let down somewhat by her slot distribution. Her slots being nearly evenly distributed makes her good for launching airstrikes since it spreads the damage around. Her large slot being on top reduces the chances of her losing out on plane proficiency bonuses. Additionally, her two medium slots being on the large side in their own right means she is less at risk of losing the ability to artillery spot. Her ability to shell at moderate damage is another bonus. However, she is only available from LSC which makes her expensive to obtain.

==[[Katori]]==

Priority:'''Low'''

: Her main role is to provide an experience boost in PvP. When paired with her sister [[Kashima]], they can give a significant boost. Her low combat and defensive stats makes her unsuited for surface combat. She does have an edge when it comes to ASW because she possesses 4 slots which allows her to get maximum synergy bonuses. However, her low base ASW becomes an issue when trying to achieve OASW. She well require a lot of levels to be effective.

Priority: '''Low'''

: She doesn't have any use outside of a few limited niches like cheesing 2-1 for quests, subtanking the 3-5 north route or 6-1 routing. Outside of those limited uses, her good defensive stats and large slots for a submarine make her a good candidate when you require a submarine that can provide air support.

====Recommended Roles====
* Air Support

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Combat

==[[Akitsu Maru]]==

Priority:'''Low'''

: She has a limited role in providing air support where carriers or other aviation ships cannot be used. Although she can perform ASW, she is subpar in this role because she cannot take advantage of synergy bonuses or achieve OASW.

====Recommendend Roles====
* Air Support

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Anti-Submarine

===Important Information===
* She is a source of [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft]], [[Type 3 Spotter/Liaison (ASW)]] and [[Ka-type Observation Autogyro]].

==[[Bismarck]]==

Priority: '''Low'''

: Both her Kai and Zwei have decent firepower and defensive stats for a fast battleship. She doesn't really bring anything else to the table other than that. Being an LSC-only ship and the added cost of a blueprint for her Zwei, it makes her not worth it.
: Her Drei gives her a torpedo stat that puts her on par with the Yamato-class for night battles but due to being unable to equip 51cm guns, she falls short. She also requires a second blueprint which is a steep cost for the minimal upgrade.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat

'''Prin Eugen Kai'''

Priority: '''Medium'''

:At first remodel, this German heavy cruiser has decent Firepower and a good Torpedo stat, making her suited for daytime surface combat thanks to [[Artillery Spotting]] and useful in night battle too, where her outstanding 40 Luck makes her a very viable choice for torpedo cut-ins.

:No further remodels have been implemented for her yet (as of November 2020).

===Important Information===
* An option for C15 and C21.
* Comes with a [[New High Pressure-Temperature Steam Boiler]] once remodeled.

==[[Akashi]]==

Priority: '''Very High'''

: She is the most important girl in your fleet because of her ability to upgrade equipment. It is the only way to access most event and ranking only equipment. Equipment upgrades are important to boost the effectiveness of your other girls. Her repair ability is a nice bonus that allows you to get more girls repaired while away for an extended period of time. It is imperative that you get her to Kai as soon as possible for the boost in success rates.

===Important Info===
* Required for quest A45.
* Required for all equipment upgrade quests.

==[[Ooyodo]]==

Priority: '''Medium'''

:A four slot light cruiser, similar to [[Gotland]], who brings more flexibility than average to the fleet.
:For example, she can turn into an hard-hitting attacker against enemy installations when fitted with two [[WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)]].
:However, do note that her ASW stat is very low, so not even the fourth slot makes her able to perform OASW before marriage.
:Likewise, a low Torpedo stat makes her perform poorly in night battles.
:No further remodels have been implemented for her yet (as of January 2020).

====Recommended Roles====
* Anti-installation

===Important Info===
* Required for A65, B57, B114, and B134.
* Source of [[Fleet Command Facility]]

==[[Taigei]]==

Priority: '''Very Low'''

* Taigei
: Her main use as Taigei is routing requirements in 6-1. In all other respects, she is a subpar ship. She can be used to contest air superiority where carriers are banned but any other aviation ship will be better than her.

* Ryuuhou
: Her firepower is bad and her plane counts to not help. In addition, she has a bad slot distribution with a single large slot and the rest of her slots being small. This limits her to taking only one bomber. Her one saving grace is that her large slot is on top which allows her to take advantage of the proficiency bonus easily. All that said, her remodel requires a blueprint which makes it very costly for the minimal benefits she brings.

Priority: '''Medium'''

* Ryuuhou Kai Ni (E)
: She is a great light carrier in her slots and flexibility, but costs a prototype flight deck catapult and 2 Blueprints to completion. She is currently the only Light Carrier capable of night time operations without additional equipment, but comes at the drawback of slow speed.

==[[Graf Zeppelin]]==

Priority: '''Low'''

: Although she has decent firepower, her slot distribution hurts her a lot. Since every other slot besides her top slot is small, she doesn't have a lot of striking power. It also means she can easily lose her ability to artillery spot. Her innate night attack is just a gimmick since it is a normal shelling attack that is based off her low firepower. Since she is also an event-only ship, her performance is not worth her rarity.

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Air Support
* Shelling Support
* Airstrike Support

==[[Saratoga]]==

Priority: 

* Kai: '''Medium'''
: She has good firepower which makes her a good combatant. She is let down by her slot distribution. While she has a large top slot that makes for a powerful airstrike, her other slots being small means they risk being emptied. This can potentially disable her ability to artillery spot. 

* Mk.II: '''High'''
: Her Mk.II remodel is unique in that it does not require [[Night Operation Aviation Personnel]] to trigger night carrier cut-ins. This leaves more room for attack planes which gives her the most powerful night attack of the carriers. It also means she doesn't need to compromise her daytime combat ability.
: In addition to her special ability, her firepower and slot distribution is excellent. Her two large slots being on top means that she can more easily maintain her ability to artillery spot and the plane proficiency bonus. Her remodel does come at a steep cost but it is well worth it for her abilities.

* Mk.II mod.2: '''Medium'''
: She loses the innate ability to attack at night with her mod.2 remodel but gains the ability to shell while moderately damaged. She also loses a bit of firepower but gains plane count. Her slot distribution remains good and she is a good shelling carrier.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Air Support

===Important Info===

==[[Warspite]]==

Priority: '''Low'''

: She has good firepower for a slow battleship but her defensive stats are lower than other slow battleships. Her AACI has a low fixed shootdown and multiplier. It also has a high API number which can interfere with other AACI in the fleet. Her advantage is her low cost which makes her a good choice for support expeditions.

==[[Iowa]]==

Priority: '''High'''

: She has very high firepower for a fast battleship and her high defensive stats make her even better. Her drawbacks are that she is an event-only drop and she is very costly to run. If you do have her, and resources are not an issue, she is a top pick for a fast battleship.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Support Expeditions

==[[Littorio]]==

Priority: '''Low'''

: She is a fast battleship with high firepower, which makes her a good choice for maps with speed restrictions. Her ability to carry seaplane fighters means she can also assist with air power on maps with speed restrictions. However, this will compromise her combat ablity. She also requires a blueprint which is a steep cost for the benefit she brings.

==[[Aquila]]==

Priority: '''Low'''

: She has very low firepower, HP and armour. While her slot count is not the lowest, her slot distribution is very bad. Her top slot being so small means she risks losing the plane proficiency bonus and the ability to artillery spot. Her large slot is decent but not large enough to give her a good airstrike to make up for her shortcomings. Though she is cheap to run, she is event-only. So her performance is not worth her rarity.

====Not Recommended Roles====

==[[Akitsushima]]==

Priority: '''High'''

: Her main role is to allow slow fleets in 6-4 to take the shorter route.

==[[Mizuho]]==

Priority: '''Medium'''

: She has a good torpedo stat that allows her to take out lighter ships with her opening torpedo. She also has respectable firepower for a seaplane tender that makes her a decent surface combatant. Her slots are also large enough that she can use seaplane bombers to deal with light targets. Being able to carry seaplane fighters means she can provide air supports in maps where carriers are restricted. However, she is slow which means she will be affected by speed restrictions.

==[[Hayasui]]==

Priority:'''Medium'''

: Her main role is to carry Maritime Resupplies to mitigate ammo penalties in long maps. Do note that the resupplies are consumed upon activation. When equipped with torpedo bombers, she becomes a very effective combatant because she uses the carrier shelling formula and gains plane proficiency bonus. Her drawback is that she is at risk of getting her slots emptied when encountering heavy anti-air.

==[[Commandant Teste]]==

Priority: '''Medium'''

: Her firepower and ability to artillery spot is enough to make her a decent daytime combatant. But she falls off in effectiveness at night because she lacks a torpedo stat. Her 4 slots and high plane count allows her to take full advantage of plane proficiency bonuses for airstrikes with seaplane bombers.

: Her Kai has low firepower and HP for a battleship. Her armour is decent but nowhere near enough to make up for her lack of combat ability.
: At Dva, she gains a torpedo stat that makes her respectable in night battles but she still suffers from low daytime combat ability. Her advantage of having a low remodel level and cost to gain the torpedo stat is outweighed by her status as event-only and being slow.

====Not Recommended Roles====

:She has also a solid Firepower stat, making her a reliable daytime combatant with [[Artillery Spotting]], but her Torpedo stat is lower than average, reducing her usefulness at night.
:Her innate ASW stat is good, and the extra slots gives her an edge in the anti-submarine role, further increasing her versatility.

Priority: '''Medium'''

:Destroyer escorts, also known as ''kaiboukan'', are cheap, mass-produced vessels focused on ASW, and that's what they should be used for.
:With proper gear, they can perform OASW attacks from level 1 and consume very little fuel and ammo, giving an excellent bang for your bucks when it comes to dealing with subs.
:However, they are a poor fit for surface combat, so make sure not to expose them to enemy surface ships too much.

:The differences in combat stats that actually matter between DEs are minimal, so feel free to use the ones you prefer.
:They're also very cheap and easy to sparkle, and can therefore be used in expeditions that do not require a [[Drum Canister]] (as they cannot equip those).
:Furthermore, they can be used for an unique kind of [[Modernization]] that can increase HP, ASW and Luck. Refer to the corresponding page for details on that.

==[[Gambier Bay]]==

Priority: '''Low'''
: Her firepower is on the low side and she is made worse by her low plane count and only having 3 slots to work with. All her slots are small which severely limits her damage potential. Although she can OASW, she is unable to take advantage of synergy bonuses which limits her potential.

==[[Intrepid]]==

Priority: '''High'''

: She has decent firepower with excellent plane counts and slot distribution. The size of her top two slots make it highly unlikely that they will be emptied and gives her a very powerful airstrike. Her 3rd slot is also a respectable size that gives her the option of adding to her airstrike power or bringing fighters. While she may be event-only, she is absolutely worth the effort to obtain.

==[[Samuel B. Roberts]]==

Priority: '''Low'''
:A famed US destroyer escort, she is somehow implemented as a DD in game, meaning that her stats are on the level of a [[Mutsuki]]-class ship's first remodel.
:However, her ASW stat is very good and allows her to perform OASW easily, and once remodeled she can also perform OASW attacks innately, albeit those won't do much unless she has actual ASW gear on her.

:Do keep in mind that she is the only in-game destroyer with Slow speed, which can potentially cause problems with routing. (A single [[Improved Steam Turbine]] can fix that, though.)
:Her base luck of 40 is good, allowing for mildly reliable cut-in attacks at night. However, her stat distributions means said attacks will not be able to hit hard.

:No further remodels have been implemented for her yet (as of January 2020).

:She also comes with an array of powerful Fletcher-class [[Anti-Air Cut-In]] attacks and the possibility (unique to US light ships so far) to perform multiple rolls for those instead of just one, making her a reliable choice for the fleet's air defense. 
:(Do note that her AACI requires two [[5inch Naval Gun Mk.30 Kai + GFCS Mk.37]] to bring out her full potential.) 
:Finally, a decent base Luck of 40 allows for mildly reliable cut-in attacks at night. However, her stat distributions means said attacks will not be able to hit hard.

==[[Nelson]]==

Priority: '''High'''

: She has great firepower for a battleship but what really makes her stand out is her powerful special ability. Unlike [[Nagato]] and [[Mutsu]], her ability does not take extra ammo when it triggers; but it has a slightly weaker multiplier and requires 3 good ships instead of just 2 to make full use of it. Although she is event-only and hard to get, she'll serve you very well when you do get her. Her AACI has a low fixed shootdown and multiplier which makes it inadvisable to run.

==[[Gotland]]==

Priority (Kai): '''Medium-High'''

* A four slot Swedish light cruiser, similar to [[Ooyodo]], who brings lots of flexibility to the fleet.
* For example, the extra slot allows her to perform powerful OASW attacks despite her ASW stat not being anything special, and turns her into an hard-hitting attacker against enemy installations when fitted with two [[WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)]].
* Her excellent anti-air stat of 102 also makes her a choice for dealing with enemy bombers, even though her unique [[Anti-Air Cut-In]] isn't generally worth using over the standard one.

Andra: '''very low'''

She gains the ability to equip Autogyros and Daihatsu-Class Landing craft and gets larger plane slots. This will make her a better choice for Transport Combined Fleets, Expeditions and Anti-Installation Warfare than before. However, costing a Prototype Flight Deck Catapult and Blueprint make it hard to recommend the remodel for these rather incremental improvements.

====Recommended Roles====

==[[Maestrale]]==

Priority: '''Medium-Low'''
:An Italian destroyer with performance comparable to a [[Fubuki]]-class' first remodel, albeit with a much stronger ASW stat that allows her to perform OASW easily and free up other DDs for different tasks.

:No further remodels have been implemented for her yet (as of January 2020).

====Recommended Roles====

==[[Nisshin]]==

Priority:'''High'''

* Kai
: She has a good torpedo stat that allows her to take out lighter ships with her opening torpedo. She also has good firepower for a seaplane tender that makes her a decent surface combatant. While she has a large slot, her slot distribution isn't ideal to utilize seaplane bombers because she needs to place one in a small slot to take advantage of proficiency bonuses. In addition, her ability to equip [[WG42]] and the [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank]] makes her a powerful anti installation ship.

* A
: She gains a significant upgrade to her torpedo and firepower that makes her an even better combat ship. Her biggest upgrade is gaining a 4th slot. This means that, prior to the introduction of [[Yahagi]] Kai Ni B & [[Mogami]] Kai Ni Toku, she was the only ship capable of running an artillery spotting setup with opening torpedoes. The 4th slot also increases her anti-installation ability significantly.

==[[Colorado]]==

Priority: '''Low'''

: Her firepower is not bad but she loses out to the other slow battleships. She is the weakest of the Big 7s with special attacks and that firepower gap is even bigger when taking into account multipliers.
