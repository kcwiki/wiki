* [Green Box] => [Sweets] (Irako ✕ 1)
* [Grey Box] ==> [Material] ([[file:Development material.png|30px]] ✕ 3 and [[file:Improvement Materials.png|30px]] ✕ 1)

==Notes==
* Via [[Game_Updates/2014/December_12th|December 12th, 2014 Update]]
** Present Boxes will cease to drop after the [[Game_Updates/2014/December 26th|December 26th, 2014 Update]].
** Present Boxes in your inventory will not disappear.
* Unless you really need resources, it is recommended to choose the Material Box as those are more efficient and harder to obtain. Irako can be used to boost your ships to sparkle but you can do that manually.
* There seems to be no limitation on how many present boxes you can store.
* The present boxes are rare drops, so don't feel bad if you don't get one.
* As of the [[Game_Updates/2015/April_10th|April 10th, 2014 Update]], you can get one Present Box every month by clearing [[World_1#World_1-6:_.E3.80.90Extra_Operation.E3.80.91_.E9.8E.AE.E5.AE.88.E5.BA.9C.E8.BF.91.E6.B5.B7.E8.88.AA.E8.B7.AF_Sea_Route_Near_Naval_Base|1-6]].
* Reward for completing one-time sortie quest [[Quests#B37|B37]].
