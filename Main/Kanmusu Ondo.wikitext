==Introduction==
[[File:Kanmusu_Ondo_Cover.jpg|thumb|right|Disc Cover to Kanmusu Ondo, part of the KanColle Vocal Soundtrack Series]]'''Kanmusu Ondo''' (also known more literally as "Fleet Girl Folk Song") is a song that appeared in the [[Naval District Saury Festival]] of 2016. Kanmusu Ondo is unique among the songs that have played in the game in that there is also a dance that is associated with the song. It was also played at the [[Naval District Saury Festival in Yokohama]] in which [[Tanibe Yumi]] and several other dancers performed said dance. 

There are currently no recordings of the dance in question. But it was made official by both reports and through [[Tanibe Yumi]] that they did perform it there, and those who attended the festival had a chance to learn the dance.

In addition, the song was also sung by [[Tanibe Yumi]] representing the voices of [[Shiratsuyu]], [[Murasame]], [[Shigure]], and [[Yuudachi]] as noted in her [[Tanibe Yumi Interview: Kancolle Style Vol. 3|interview]].

On '''February 14th, 2017''' Kadokawa would release the official full length version of the Kanmusu Ondo song as part of [[KanColle Vocal Collection|KanColle Vocal Collection Soundtrack Vol.4]]. This soundtrack includes Kanmusu Ondo along with a song sung by [[Yura]] (also voiced by [[Tanibe Yumi]]) and an instrumental version. The song is available for purchase via Kadokawa's website.

==Dance Choreography==
Kanmusu Ondo also features a dance which was performed at the [[Naval District Saury Festival in Yokohama]] by [[Tanibe Yumi]] and a series of back up dancers.

People who attended the Festival got to see the dance performed live, and [[Tanibe Yumi]] also taught the dance to all the participants. No footage of the dance was recorded and people who learned the dance never showed how it was performed (possibly due to contract reasons). However, when [[KanColle Style|KanColle Style Vol.4]] was published, the book explains in full how the dance would be performed.  

In addition, the dance is planned to be performed several times over at the [[Zuiun Festival]] during the Summer as well.

People interested in wanting to learn how to perform the dance can watch the following video on NicoVideo.
