===Tips===
* To complete the map, you will need to defeat the flagship (Tsu-Class Light Cruiser) 4 times. Upon completing this task you will be rewarded with '''150 points''' and a '''medal'''. The map will reset at midnight JST at the beginning of every month.
**The map will also stay in '''Final Form''' once you cleared it until the next month reset. Therefore, it's recommended to do all 3-5 quests pre-clear for easier time, as doing them post-clear can make the job much harder.
* LoS requirement
**For G-K (south) '''≥ 28 F33 Cn4''' 
**For H-K (north) '''≥ ~40 F33 Cn4'''
* Middle route (B-E-H-K or F-E-H-K) is not recommended, not only does this require an awkward fleet composition (either a CL 2 DD in a heavy fleet or a BB/CV in a light one), E node presents two Ru-Flags that can potentially damage any of your ships.
<br/>'''Recommended Fleet'''
*'''North Route (B-D-H-K)'''
**'''3 [(F)BB(V)+CV(B/L)], 3 XX (XX being any CA(V), SS(V), CLT)'''
***Ships that are specialized in AACI such as [[Maya|Maya Kai Ni]] can be used to protect your fleet on the way to the boss node
*'''South Route (F-G-K)'''
**''' 1 CL + 5 DD / 1 AV + 5 DD'''
*** Regarded as the 'standard' composition, this is the strongest possible composition that is guaranteed to reach the boss via '''F-G-K''', assuming LoS requirements are met. It is recommended to try the south route with this composition first.
*** Sparkling is recommended for lower level DDs as you are unlikely to kill or disable all enemies in preboss nodes, which can lead to closing torpedoes critically damaging the low-armored DDs if not evaded.
**''' 1 AV + 1 CL + 4 DD / 2 AV + 2 CL + 2 DD / 3-4 AV + 2-3 CL'''
***Sacrifices guaranteed routing, but in exchange for opening strikes, and possibility of Air Parity (Air Superiority with [[Mizuho]] Kai or seaplane fighters) at G node on the final clear.
*** There is a risk of getting sent off-course to node B. Players may opt to refresh the game if sent to B.
**'''[[Hayasui|Hayasui Kai]] + 2 AV + 1 CLT + 2 CL'''
***Takes you along the path of '''B-C-F-G-K'''
***Arming [[Hayasui]] with a SCAMP and some Torpedo Bombers will help her aid by getting a better chance to do some damage in battle.
*** Seaplane Tenders should be armed with either Seaplane Bombers or Seaplane Fighters
*** CL and CLT such as [[Abukuma]], [[Kitakami]] and [[Ooi]] are preferred to help wipe out the enemies easier.
*** While it's more expensive in comparison to other compositions, this is also more likely to ensure your survival to the boss node.
