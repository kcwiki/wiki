===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''
: She is just an average destroyer at Kai that doesn't have anything to set her apart from the rest. She gains better firepower and ASW along with a significant boost to her torpedo at Kai Ni. This makes her a decent combat destroyer but she is still among the bottom ranks of your combat destroyer choices.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat

====Not Recommended Roles====
* ASW

===Important Information===
* Required for A48, A85, B37, and C17.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Medium'''
: She is just an average destroyer at Kai that doesn't have anything to set her apart from the rest. Her boosts to firepower, torpedo and ASW at Kai Ni aren't that fantastic but when combined with her significant increase to luck, it makes her a decent backup torpedo cut in destroyer. 

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat

====Not Recommended Roles====
* ASW

===Important Information===
* Required for A48, A54, A85, B37, B38, B46, and C17.
