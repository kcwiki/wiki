==Introduction==
防空型駆逐艦の主砲です。<br />
画期的な長砲身半自動装填砲を動力砲塔に備えた「長10cm」と呼ばれた新型の防空用高角砲で、
「秋月」型駆逐艦に搭載されました。<br />
複雑な構造のため量産には不向きでしたが、敵機の跳梁を抑える艦隊防空の切り札の一つです。

''This is the main gun of the anti-air destroyers.<br> It is a groundbreaking new model anti-air high-angle gun with a long barrel, semi-automatic loading and a powered turret. It was equipped on the Akizuki-class destroyers.<br> Its complex design made it difficult to mass-produce, but it was a key part of the fleet's defence against the air superiority of enemy aircraft.''

One of Japan's relatively successful anti-air weapons, being equipped on carrier [[Taihou]], light cruiser Oyodo and Akizuki-class destroyers (the illustration shows the turret-mounted variant seen on Akizuki-class; Oyodo and Taihou were equipped with [[10cm Twin High-angle Carriage Mount|carriage-mounted ones]]). Both muzzle velocity and operating speed were increased significantly compared to [[12.7cm_Twin_Gun_Mount|traditional destroyer guns]], making it more effective toward enemy aircraft. In reality its anti-surface ability was not as high due to accuracy and ammunition mass but in-game it has the same firepower stat as the twin 12.7cm. Although the gun proved effective, Japanese Navy's anti-air ability still lagged behind as the anti-air fire control device was outdated. 

: It is easily accessible in-game as most destroyers carry it as stock equipment upon remodel; Chief Developer Mr. Tanaka once regretted that this weapon "was deployed rather too early, even before the Akizuki-class appeared in-game" in an interview.

==Note==
Buildable. Not to be confused with [[10cm Twin High-angle Carriage Mount]] . Stock equipment of all remodeled DDs except Mutsuki class, Yuugumo class, and Akigumo.
