==Introduction==
呉海軍工廠砲熕部で開発された純国産戦艦用三連装主砲、その改修改良型です。if兵装ではありますが、軽量化及び射撃装置を熟成改良した同改良砲を、航空戦艦への装備、特に伊勢型航空戦艦に最適化改修した戦艦主砲兵装です。特に大規模改装後の伊勢型改二では、その潜在能力を遺憾なく発揮します。

''An improved version of a triple main battery for purely domestic battleships that was developed at the artillery department of the Kure Naval Arsenal.  It may be a fictitious armament, but it's supposed to be modified version of said gun with reduced weight as well as a fully developed fire control system, turning it into a battleship main armament that has been optimised as equipment for aviation battleships, especially the Ise-class aviation battleships. The Ise-class K2 in particular, after undergoing its large-scale refit, will show its full potential.''

==Note==
Unlike most guns, the 41cm Triple Gun Mount Kai Ni gives special bonus benefits when equipped to [[Ise]], [[Hyuuga]], [[Fusou]] and [[Yamashiro]] which are as follows:

* [[Ise]] Kai and [[Hyuuga]] Kai: +2 [[File:Icon_Gun.png]] , +2 [[File:Icon_AA.png]], +1 [[File:Icon_Evasion.png]]

* [[Fusou]] Kai Ni and [[Yamashiro]] Kai Ni: +1 [[File:Icon_Gun.png]]

When equipping this gun long with an Air Radar, the following bonuses are provided to the Ise-class:

* [[Ise]] Kai and [[Hyuuga]] Kai: +2 [[File:Icon_AA.png]], +3 [[File:Icon_Evasion.png]]

Overall, using the gun in combination with an air radar will provide [[Ise]] and [[Hyuuga]] a total of +2 [[File:Icon_Gun.png]] , +4 [[File:Icon_AA.png]], +4 [[File:Icon_Evasion.png]]

Stacking effect from multiple 41cm Triple Gun Mount Kai Ni is TBD.
