Afterwards the Seiyuus came back on stage and got to eat various food that were a part of the Zuiun's Festival's attraction which they talked about and mentioned to the audience to look into getting if possible. They also tried to determine which food tasted the best in the process. 

Following this the Seiyuus performed the [[Kanmusu Ondo]] dance on stage and told everyone they would be doing the dance at the Zuiun later on that day before one of the Seiyuus then performed a KanColle song.
