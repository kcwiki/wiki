==Introduction==
大威力長射程を誇る、秘密兵器「九三式酸素魚雷」。<br />
その必殺の酸素魚雷を最大限に詰め込み、一基で旧型駆逐艦一隻<br />
分以上の雷装火力を持つ試作六連装【酸素魚雷】発射管です。<br />
後期の新型駆逐艦に搭載する計画もありました。

''The secret weapon "Type 93 Oxygen Torpedo" known for its power and long range.''<br/>
''This is the prototype sextuple [Oxygen Torpedoes] firing tubes created by loading the oxygen torpedoes as much as possible, and one of these has more torpedo firepower than an older-class destroyer would have.''<br/>
''There were plans to equip the new later-model destroyers with these.''
