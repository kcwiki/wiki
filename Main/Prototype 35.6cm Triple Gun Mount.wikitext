高速戦艦に搭載するための新開発の試製戦艦主砲です。<br />「金剛」型高速戦艦の代替新建造艦のために計画されていた三連装の35.6cm砲で、大口径主砲よりはコンパクトで軽く、もちろん従来の35.6cm砲より火力及び命中率が大きく向上しています。<br>高速戦艦の改装時に、ぜひ運用をお試しください！

A newly developed prototype main battleship armament intended to be equipped on fast battleships.<br>
This triple-mounted 35.6cm gun was planned to be for the successor to the Kongou-class fast battleships. It is slightly smaller and lighter than other large calibre guns. It's firepower and accuracy has been significantly improved compared to the original 35.6cm guns.<br>
