==Strategy== <!-- Detailed events -->
Within the water, a recitation of the [[Anime/Episodes/Hajimemashite!_Shireikan!#Notes|Gosei]] is heard.

As the setting is described, an [[Enemy_vessel|Abyssal fleet]], [[Anime/Episodes/Hajimemashite!_Shireikan!#Abyssal_Fleets|Fleet Zero]], is shown. Along with a palette shift, a it morphs into [[Anime/Episodes/Hajimemashite!_Shireikan!#Abyssal_Fleets|Fleet One]] & is then engaged by a naval base's [[Anime/Episodes/Hajimemashite!_Shireikan!#Naval_Base_Fleets|Fourth Fleet]]. The naval base is in search of the Abyssal's base.

A newly-assigned & now arrived [[Fubuki]] procedes inside the main building, is taken on a tour, one stop being a shared room & meeting the rest of the [[Anime/Episodes/Hajimemashite!_Shireikan!#Naval_Base_Fleets|Third Torpedo Squadron]].

A fight scene interrupts, with the result being the base is located & the Fourth Fleet is ordered to return.

Back at the base, [[Mutsuki]], [[Yuudachi]], & Fubuki share their combat experience, with Fubuki providing an odd answer. She's saved by a trip to the to the famous First Carrier Division. [[Akagi]]'s words strike a chord within Fubuki, especially the hope to be in the same fleet.

The next stop is Cafe Mamiya, but before they get to fully enjoy, a siren activates, notifying them & others.

At the port, the [[Anime/Episodes/Hajimemashite!_Shireikan!#Naval_Base_Fleets|Third Torpedo Squadron]], the [[Anime/Episodes/Hajimemashite!_Shireikan!#Naval_Base_Fleets|First (Carrier) Task Force]], & the [[Anime/Episodes/Hajimemashite!_Shireikan!#Naval_Base_Fleets|Second Support Fleet]] are briefed as the Fourth Fleet rests in the docks.

Troubles arise when it is revealed Fubuki has no experience, but with coaxing from the others, she pushes on. They encounter [[Anime/Episodes/Hajimemashite!_Shireikan!#Abyssal_Fleets|Fleet Two]], with Second Support Fleet soon engaging as well.

Suddenly, Fubuki is ambushed by a [[Anime/Episodes/Hajimemashite!_Shireikan!#Abyssal_Fleets|Fleet Three]] [[Destroyer I-Class|Destroyer I-Class Elite Late Model]], but before it can damage her the Second Fleet's air wing strikes. With the Second Support Fleet's assistance, Akagi's third wave wraps it up.

As the day comes to a close, Fubuki is left somber; however, the admiral takes time now to step in & reinvigorate Fubuki, sending her back to her fleet as they wind down from the day. Fubuki really idolizes Akagi & wants to be her escort.

==[[Anime/Notes_%26_Trivia#Notes|Notes]]==
The episode composition is an info-dump
* Possibly utilizes short scenes & one-liners to add as many kanmusu & animate as many game aspects as possible. 
* As of January 8th, 2015, there are 147 kanmusu.

[[Anime/Staff_%26_Cast#Cast|Certain seiyuu have multiple roles]]
* As can be observed in the credits

[[wikipedia:Gosei_(meditation)|Gosei]] is read by Mdm Sakakibara (?)
 These reflections were originally devised by Vice Admiral Hajime Matsushita,
 who was the Chief of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy.
 Every evening cadets are expected to meditate on these inter-related questions.
   1. Hast thou not gone against sincerity
   2. Hast thou not felt ashamed of thy words and deeds
   3. Hast thou not lacked vigor
   4. Hast thou exerted all possible efforts
   5. Hast thou not become slothful
<br>

Mutsuki implies that there are multiple bases
* According to English subtitles, anyways

Naka is advertising her first live
* It seems she is relatively new or has only recently set being an idol as a goal

The CM outro is a [[Glossary#List_of_vessels_by_artist|Shibafu]] [[Anime/Episodes#Gallery|Fubuki illustration]]

Most duties are handled by the Secretary Ship

''Etch our victory into the sunrise!''
* Possibly a IJN motto?

''No arrogance!''
* It is a running theme in the second half, as well as a oft used line of Akagi's 
* A speculation, but perhaps a reference to a common belief regarding the IJN's loss of momentum in WWII

Only [[Kongo|Kongou is Kai Ni]].

Fighters have enough gun & cannon firepower to deflect destroyers
* Unlike the game, much less reality

Arrows transmogrify in a yellow aura after shooting into aircraft

The basic [[:Category:Kongo_Class|Kongou Class]] armaments can fire in the [[Anime/Episodes#Gallery|X-form]] or [[Anime/Episodes#Gallery|compact form]].
