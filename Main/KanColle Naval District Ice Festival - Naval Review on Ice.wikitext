The show played out as followed:

===Act 1===

Wave are shown on the ice floor as the move across the water. <br>
Eventually the water turns to a crimson red cover.<br>
The '''Abyssal Ice Skating Princess''' (Rina Sawayama) emrges and begins to perform a solo ice skating performance.<br>
[[Yuudachi]], [[Asashio]], [[Hibiki]], [[Shigure]], [[Abukuma]], one other Kanmusu ([[Jintsuu]] on Day 1, [[Yuubari]] on Day 2) appear on stage and skate around in a single line formation. <br>
Then begin to change into a double line formation while going around the ice rink<br>
Then [[Mogami]] ,[[Mikuma]] and Kongou Sisters come out on stage to join up with the others forming a combined fleet<br>
The 12 then begin to perform some basic figure skating and various maneuvers while skating around the ice rink<br>
Suddenly the Kanmusus are ambushed by 2 Abyssal, the '''Abyssal Ice Skating Princess''' (Rina Sawayama) and the '''Legendary Abyssal Ice Skating Princess''' (Midori Ito) <br>
The 2 Abyssal begin to perform various ice skating maneuvers that were out performing what the Kanmusus were doing on stages (more or less showing they were way better compared to them)<br>
But then... a shadow appears on stage!<br>
A male figure enters the stage and it's revealed to be Takahito Mura as the Admiral!<br>
Takahito Mura comes on stage and begins to perform his skilled triple axles and such on stage and wowing the crowd<br>
Then following that he has a moment with the 4 Kongous as he and the 4 of them skate together while the "Marriage Music" plays <br>
Following this, Naval Excersies commenced as 6 ship girls figured skated in opposite parts of the skating ring. <br>
[[Uchida Shuu]] came out on stage as [[Warspite]] as she was escorted by one of the skaters to a chair like device which was designed like her rigging as she skated around the arena she would then welcome everyone to the KanColle Ice Festival in English followed by a shorter welcome in Japanese.<br>
Soon a battle commences as the enemy abyssal launch thier attack which consisted of the two princesses and 4 [[PT Imp Group]]<br>
The Princesses and the ship girls figure skate around the arena until the skating area goes black<br>
Afterwards an introduction to the Seiyuus who are voicing the show was announced which then lead to intermission....

'''End of Act 1'''

===Act 2 (Final Act)===

Kaiboukan appear on stage and beginning to perform on stage to various KanColle. All the Kaiboukan who performed on stage were children.<br>
Following thier performance, each shigirl appeared on stage 2-4 at a time. <br>
Once after all the Kanmusu entered the stage the ice rink went black and then the arena had a festival stand that appeared and the 6 Seiyuus mentioned in the show appeared on stage on the stand. <br>
The [[Kanmusu Ondo]] was then performed on stage.<br>
Following the song the 2nd battle against the Abyssal Princesses commenced<br>
Ship girls continue to skate along with the Admiral as they try to out perform the Ice Skating Princesses<br>
[[Akagi]] and [[Kaga]] come in to aid and assist in the battle. <br>
During the battle the Abyssal Ice Princess was chased away by the Legendary Ice Princess leaving her alone to fight the Kanmusu
Eventually the Legendary Ice Princess was defeated which lead to the final segment where an image of the moon appeared in the Ice Rink followed by the song [[Tsukiyomi]] being performed by the Seiyuus (who returned on stage) while the Kanmusus skated around the stage with the admiral. <br>
It concludes with one Kanmusu skating in the light side of the moon while Rina Sawayama (The Abyssal Ice Princess) skates into the dark side of the moon<br>
Which is likely to be intended to be some kind of metaphor of how Kanmusus and Abyssals are one of the same, just two sides of the coin

'''End of Final Act'''

==Famitsu Article + Photos from Show==

Below is an article that was written on Famitsu.com regarding the Ice Skating Festival. The follow information and pictures are all property of Famitsu.

On 14 and 15 July 2018, a Kantai Collection event “KanColle Chinjufu Ice Festival in Makuhari Special Harbour – Naval Review on Ice” is taking place at Makuhari Event Hall in Chiba prefecture. Performers include top-notch ice skaters as well Shipgirls’ seiyuu, in what turned out to be an astonishing event.
 
'''Figure Skaters'''<br>
* KanColle Chinjufu Ice Festival’s First Striking Force and Kido Butai’s Main Force’s Special Formation teams.

'''Special Guests:'''<br>
* Ito Midori (Olympic silver medalist, and 8-time consecutive champion of Japan)
* Takahito Mura (3 times world champion, Four Continents Championship champion, Pyonyang Olympic representative)
* Sawayama Rina (Ice skating junior champion of Japan, ice dancing 3 times champion of Japan)

'''Seiyuu:'''<br>
* Saki Fujita ([[Akagi]] etc.)
* Nomizu Iori ([[Zuikaku]] etc.)
* Aya Suzaki ([[Hibiki]] etc.)
* Yumi Tanibe ([[Yuudachi]] etc.)
* Uchida Shu ([[Warspite]] etc.)
* Miyagawa Wakana ([[Michishio]] etc.)
 
Just for this occasion part of the Makuhari Event Hall was turned into an ice rink. The show started with Sawayama Rina’s solo performance as Abyssal Ice Princess. Next, the Special Formations appeared, with Shipgirls like [[Akagi]], [[Kaga]], Kongou sisters, [[Yuudachi]] or [[Hibiki]] and began performing fleet maneuvers to the rhythm of KanColle’s BGM.

Ito Midori in role of the Abyssal Ice Legend Princess, accompanied by the orchestral arrangement of “Modorenai”, gave a very powerful performance worth of the main villain.
 
Amid the battle group of skaters, the sole male role was given to Takahito Mura, whose role was, of course, that of the Admiral. Wrapped in the white navy uniform he performed spin jumps etc. However, as befitting of the Admiral, there were also Shipgirl commanding scenes with his participation.
 
The performance was tailored as a story told by ice skaters, BGM, sound and lighting effects, to show the interactions between the Admiral and his Shipgirls, training and practice, the appearance of Kaiboukans, and of course battles between Shipgirls and the Abyssals. In addition to the ice show, seiyuu took on stage performing “Kanmusu Ondo” and “Tsukiyomi”, and for those with taste for instrumental music there were wadaiko (Japanese drums) and violin concerts held in the venue. As such, you can see that there was an abundance of very entertaining content, which makes me believe that this way of presenting and enjoying KanColle is a very real possibility.
 
My thoughts as an Admiral
Admiral Mura, full of dignity and self-confidence was just too awesome. Fairy-like and charming Sawayama Rina was truly, truly splendid as well. As for the last boss Ito Midori, as expected I can only say “wow, that was astonishing!”.
