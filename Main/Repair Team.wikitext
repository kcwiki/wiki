''A professional damage control team, it prevents your beloved shipgirl from sinking from lethal damage. Please use it for your decisive battle's risk management! (Item is consumed once used).''
==Notes==
'''Unbuildable.''' All players start out with 2 free Repair Teams. 

Quest rewards from [[Quests#A10|A10]], [[Quests#A23|A23]], [[Quests#A25|A25]], [[Quests#A30|A30]], [[Quests#A32|A32]], [[Quests#A33|A33]], [[Quests#B11|B11]], [[Quests#B16|B16]], [[Quests#B19|B19]], [[Quests#D5|D5]] and [[Quests#WA02|WA02]].

<br />
A ship that has Repair Team equipped will be brought back to 20% of Max HP when sunk and will be unsinkable for the rest of the battle (including night battle). Ammo/Fuel bars are not replenished.<br />

The Repair Team will '''ONLY''' repair the ship it is equipped on. It will '''NOT '''repair other ships which do not have their own repair team equipped, even if they are in the same fleet. 
[[File:Repair Team and-or Goddes on flagship.png|thumb|87x87px|You can select which Repair Team or Goddess to advance.]]
Also if this is equipped to a flagship, the player can use this before heading to another node, restoring the flagship back to moderate status (50% HP).<br />
This item is consumed upon activation.
