==Notes==
*She is required by [[Quests#A17|quest A17]] and the Nishimura Fleet and New Nishimura Fleet quests ([[Quests#A22|A22]], [[Quests#A44|A44]], [[Quests#B14|B14]], and [[Quests#B33|B33]].
{{clear}}

== Drop Locations ==
{{#invoke:ShipDropTable|returnShipDrop|Fusou}}

==Trivia==
* She takes her name from an ancient name for Japan.
** 扶桑 (fusou) sounds similar to 不幸 (fukou) or 'misfortune', & 不相応 (fusouou) or 'misplaced' or 'unsuitable'.
* Japan's first Super-Dreadnought and the first to be completely indigenous as opposed to the, at the time, British-designed [[:Category:Kongou Class|''Kongou''-class]] battlecruisers.
* Her [[#Notes|Aviation Battleship]] remodel is based off a plan for the [[:Category:Fusou Class|''Fusou''-class]] after the carrier losses at the [[wikipedia:Battle_of_Midway|''Battle of Midway'']]. However, it was executed on the [[:Category:Ise Class|''Ise''-class]] instead.
* Sunk, by possibly [[wikipedia:USS_Melvin_(DD-680)|USS ''Melvin'']], during night battle in the [[wikipedia:Battle_of_Surigao_Strait|''Battle of Surigao Strait'']], October 25th, 1944.
** There is a conflict in the accounts of her sinking:
**# Torpedoes caused progressive flooding, upending and capsizing her within forty minutes.
**# Torpedoes struck a magazine, causing a spectacular explosion and splitting in two with each half remaining afloat and burning for an hour. ''This seems to be increasingly discounted.''
* Received Kai Ni on [[Game Updates/2014/October 24th|October 24th, 2014]]
