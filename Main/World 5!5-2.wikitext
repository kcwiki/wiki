**Fleet contains 2 CV(B/L), 2 CA(V) and 2 DD
**Fleet contains Shouhou and CA(V)+CL+DD+AO = 5
**Fleet contains Yuubari and CVL+CA(V)+DD+AO = 5
**'''FAST''' fleet '''AND''' one of the following conditions:
***Fleet contains Shoukaku '''AND''' Zuikaku, 2 DD and 2 wildcards
***Fleet contains no CV(B), 2 CVL and 2 DD (''Exactly 2 CVL, no more no less, (F)BB(V) not allowed'')
***Fleet contains 1 CVL, 2 DD and CA(V)

|C -> E = 
*Meet '''ANY''' of the following to '''FORCE''' E
**Fleet contains SS(V), DE and AV
**Fleet contains (F)BB(V), CV(B) or CLT ('''Ignored if the fleet contains Shoukaku, Zuikaku and 2 DDs''')
**Fleet contains slow ship ('''Ignored if the fleet meets the historical requirement above''')
**Fleets that do not meet any conditions of going to D

|D -> G/resource =
*Meet '''ANY''' of the following
**Fleet contains CL and DD only
**Fleet contains [[Shouhou]], [[Yuubari]], DD = 2, CA+AO = 2, no CAV
**Fleet contains Shouhou, 3 DD and one of the following

**Fleet contains Yuubari, 2 DD and one of the following

* Fail the LoS check.
|F -> I, O = 
* Meet '''ALL''' of the following requirements to guarantee routing to O:
** Pass the LoS check : '''> 71 F33 (C<sub>n</sub>=2)'''
** Have ≤ 2 CV(B/L) in your fleet.
*Go to I if CV(B/L) + (F)BB(V) ≥ 5 
*Otherwise, random between I and O if you pass the LoS check

|G/resource -> J/resource, L =
* Random
|L -> K = 
*Meet '''ANY''' of the following
**'''Fast+''' Fleet
**Pass the LoS check : '''> 62 F33 (C<sub>n</sub>=2)'''
|L -> M/storm = 
* Fail the LoS check
|L -> N/empty =
*AO+CL+CA = 0
}}

*Unlocking 5-2 requires clearing '''both 4-4 and 5-1'''.
*You must sink the boss '''4''' times to clear the map.

===Tips===
*This map is based on the historical operation known as '''Operation MO'''. Ships that participated in this operation can be used here to obtain special routing on this map.
**'''CV(L)''': [[Shoukaku]], [[Zuikaku]], [[Shouhou]]
**'''CL''': [[Yuubari]]
<br/>
*Like map 5-1, [[Standard Carrier Wo-Class]] Flagship with hellcat planes also makes an appearance here, especially at pre-boss nodes
**AACI is required if you wish to reach the boss node consistently
*The boss can be either [[Standard Carrier Wo-Class|Wo Kai Flagship]] or [[Aircraft Carrier Demon]].
**Sinking [[Aircraft Carrier Demon]] can be a bit harder than sinking Wo Kai Flagship, therefore, do prepare a lot of good equipment and high-level girls before attempting this map for the best success rate
**With the use of AACI, it's possible to destroy all of the enemy bombers at the boss node, completely disables the boss at day battle which can make the boss fight a lot easier
'''Recommended Fleet'''
*'''[[Shoukaku]], [[Zuikaku]], 2 DD, 2 [(F)BB(V)+CA(V)] / 2CV(L/B), 2DD, 2CA(V)''' routes '''BCDFO'''
**Please note that '''the fleet must be Fast'''.
**Los required: '''>= 71 (F33 Cn2)'''
**'''Any heavier fleets (refer to branching rules) are not recommended''' as these have a chance of off-routing to Node I, which will likely significantly deplete your bomber count due to the nature of that node.
