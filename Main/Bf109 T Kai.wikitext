== Historical Information ==
The lengthy development of the ''Graf Zeppelin'' meant that several versions of the Bf 109 were tested with carrier-landing equipment.  The Bf 109 T-1, based on the Bf 109 E, was eventually produced in small numbers before work on the ship was halted in 1940.  The Bf 109 T-2 was effectively the same aircraft minus the landing equipment, and they were used in Norway (where their short takeoff roll was useful) until the end of 1941.
