==Gameplay Notes==
===Special Mechanics===
* She is capable of carrying seaplane fighters on Kai.
* She gets 5 equipment slots at Kai Ni.
* She is capable of performing a special AACI at Kai. Please see [[Anti-Air Cut-In]] for more details.
** She gets another special AACI at Kai Ni.

===Overview===
'''Kai'''
* Great firepower, HP and armour.
* Very long default range.

'''Kai Ni'''
* Great firepower, HP and armour.
* Requires three blueprints.

===Fit Bonuses===
{{:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Equipment Bonuses}}
'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''
* She has accuracy bonuses and penalties when equipped with certain large guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''
: She is a powerful battleship that is relatively easy to obtain. However, since she is from LSC, she is prohibitively expensive for new players compared to the benefits she brings. She is also very costly to run. Although she can carry seaplane fighters, she needs to compromise her combat ability to do so. Her AACI is also bad with a low fixed shootdown and multiplier.
: Her Kai Ni makes her the most powerful battleship in the game. Along with the significant boosts to her firepower, HP and armour; she gets 5 slots which give her incredible flexibility in her loadout. The 5th slot allows her to carry a seaplane fighter to assist with air support without sacrificing her combat ability. Her AACI has a good fixed shootdown and decent multiplier. However, it requires a secondary gun to activate, which can interfere with her artillery spotting and night battle attacks. It is an option to use in combined fleets where her night battle performance is irrelevant. All this comes at a very high cost which can be better spent elsewhere for newer admirals.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Support Expeditions
* Air Support - Kai Ni
* Anti-Air - Kai Ni

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Air Support - Kai
* Anti-Air - Kai

===Important Info===
* She is an option for A43 and Bm4.

==Trivia==
*She is named after [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musashi_Province Musashi Province], made up of parts of modern day [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saitama_Prefecture Saitama] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanagawa_Prefecture Kanagawa] Prefectures.
* [[Fall 2013 Event]], E-5 clear reward.
* Sunk during the [[wikipedia:Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf|''Battle of Leyte Gulf'']] ([https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_battleship_Musashi&params=13_07_N_122_32_E_ 13°07′N 122°32′E﻿]), on October 24th, 1944.
** Musashi did not sink for 4:06 hours after receiving 19 torpedoes, 17 bombs, & 20 cannon strikes - unprecedented damage to a IJN ship; yet, it still continued to operate & attempt a [[wikipedia:Beaching_(nautical)|beaching]].
*** A generally accepted reason is [https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1674149 even flooding], which prevented quick capsizing & permitted slow sinking.
** Musashi's wreck was discovered by a [http://paulallen.com Paul Allen]-funded team on March 2nd, 2015.
*** The [https://twitter.com/PaulGAllen/status/572431062522982400 first post], the [https://twitter.com/PaulGAllen/status/572445094298578944 second post], a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFG7Oi7roes video clip], & an [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNMmqagTt90 expedition video (2:55:12)].
** This was celebrated in the [[Game_Updates/2015/March_13th|March 13th, 2015 update]] with several Musashi-related furniture and a rate increase for constructing her.
