===Analysis===
Priority: '''Medium'''
: She is just an average destroyer at Kai that doesn't have anything to set her apart from the rest. She gains significant boosts to her firepower and torpedo stats that put her among the top combat destoryers. 
: Her Kai Ni D remodel has worse combat stats than her Kai Ni but gains two important things that set it apart. Firstly, she gains a significant boost to her ASW stat that allow her to hit OASW very easily. She is one of the few destroyers capable of using single slot OASW before marriage. Secondly, she gains the ability to equip both Daihatsu and Ka-Mi tanks. This makes her a good candidate for anti-installation work. It also means she can help maximise expedition gains and be used at transport maps. As a bonus, she also gains minor buffs to her survivability.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* ASW
* Anti-installation
* Expeditions

===Important Information===
* Required for A31, A70, A71, A81, B20, B73, B74, B108 and B109
* An option for B90, and C25

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Medium'''
: She is just an average destroyer at Kai that doesn't have anything to set her apart from the rest. She gains significant boosts to her firepower and torpedo stats that make her a middle of the pack combat destroyer. Where she shines is the ability to equip Daihatsu and Ka-Mi tanks. Along with her good firepower, this makes her an anti-installation powerhouse. Although she has a relatively low remodel level, her blueprint requirement is expensive for her abilities. Especially considering that there are other destroyers with the same abilities that don't require a blueprint.

===Analysis===
Priority: 

* Kai/Kai Ni: '''High'''
: She is just an average destroyer at Kai that doesn't have anything to set her apart from the rest. She gains significant boosts to her firepower and torpedo stats that make her a middle of the pack combat destroyer. Where she shines is the ability to equip Daihatsu and Ka-Mi tanks. Along with her good firepower, this makes her an anti-installation powerhouse.

* Kai Ni B: '''Low'''
: Her Kai Ni B remodel loses out firepower and torpedo in exchange for some anti-air. She also gains a special AACI that has an average fixed shootodwn and multiplier. It also requires a Reinforcement Expansion to bring out her full potential. Since she is a common drop and doesn't require a blueprint, she can be a backup AACI destroyer if you do not have the Fletcher-class, Akizuki-class or Kagerou Kai B-class destroyers.

====Recommended Roles====
