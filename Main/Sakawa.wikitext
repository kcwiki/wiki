'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''

She has accuracy and firepower bonuses when equipped with certain medium guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''

:At first remodel, she has good Firepower and Torpedo stat for a light cruiser, meaning she can do [[Artillery Spotting]] with decent damage at day and packs a good punch at night, too.
:Her ASW stat also allow her to perform OASW attacks with proper setup.
:Furthermore, a base Luck stat of 30 makes her an option for night battle cut-in attacks in a pinch, even if those won't be too reliable or powerful.  

:No further remodels have been implemented for her yet (as of January 2020).


====Recommended Roles====
* Surface combat
* ASW

*Originally assigned to accompany [[Yamato]] during [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ten-Go Operation Ten-Go].
*Taken as a war prize by the United States and was used for repatriation efforts, turned over to the United States Navy on February 25, 1946.
*Used as target on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Crossroads Operation Crossroads] at Bikini Atoll on July 1, 1946. Sunk one day after the Able nuclear test.
*While at Eniwetok, five of its American sailors were angry over the dismal working conditions aboard Sakawa. In a ship normally staffed by over 730 men, the U.S. Navy used a crew of 165 doing the work of 325. The five sailors sabotaged the ship by removing the pressure line to the over-speed trip valves in the fuel system and pouring sand into the oil and water pumps. They smashed gauges, tachometers, and cut high pressure steam lines in an attempt to get relieved of duty aboard the filthy warship. Rather than being relieved of duty, the five sailors were brought up on charges. In May, after emergency repairs, Sakawa reached Bikini Atoll.
