[[File:Striking Force Fleet Evacuation.png|right|thumb|The Striking Force Fleet evacuation screen translated for the player's convenience.]]
This items functions much in the same manner as that of the [[Fleet Command Facility]] but unlike the Fleet Command Facility (which is used for Combined Fleet) this Command Facility is used primary for [[Striking Force Fleet]]s

As of current, the only way to obtain this item is to complete F64 in the quest section to obtain this item.

While the '''Striking Force Fleet Command Facility''' shares similarity to the [[Fleet Command Facility]], there are some unique exceptions:

* SFFCF must be equipped with the flagship of your '''Striking Force Fleet''' (which is in the First composition slot of the 3rd Fleet)
* If a ship takes heavy damage, after the battle you'll be given prompt to choose if you want to evacuate the damaged ship from the fleet for the remainder of the sortie. 
* In addition, the following details have been noted regarding the [[Striking Force Fleet Command Facility]]:
** Unlike the [[Fleet Command  Facility]], this item will '''not require a destroyer to escort a ship back''' like in a [[Combined Fleet]] and only the damaged ship will be evacuated. 
** The evacuation consumes the damaged ship's '''entire fuel & ammo reserves'''.
** Only '''one ship can be evacuated''' per battle.
** The damage the ship '''suffered may become worse during the evacuation''', but '''she will never sink'''.
