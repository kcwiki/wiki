==Trivia==
*Her name means "Auspicious Crane".
*Her high luck value is due to the fact that she did not take much damage until her final battle at [[wikipedia:Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf|Leyte Gulf]], while her sister [[Shoukaku]] always took heavy damage. Her High luck is also due in part to her name, that makes use of the kanji for "luck" as well as "crane".
*The camouflage pattern of her upgraded model clothes refers to the actual flight deck camouflage pattern used during the Leyte Gulf battle. The same pattern was also used on [[Zuihou]], [[Chitose]] and [[Chiyoda]]. 
*She was sunk by air attack in the Battle of Leyte Gulf on the 25th of October in 1944.

===Behind the Design===
[[Konishi]] has noted in the artist interview in the Mel Febri Magazine released back in December 2013 that while he was working on the designs of [[Shoukaku]] and Zuikaku, both girls were orginally design with an identical design as if they were almost twins based upon thier appearance. However, he was not satisfied with how they appeared and chose to redesign both of the ship girls before they were released for the [[Spring 2013 Event]]. In the end Konishi was able to finish and finalize the design of the [[Shoukaku]] and Zuikaku that players know today on '''May 16th, 2013''', one day before the [[Spring 2013 Event]] was released.

[[File:Konishi comparison.png|thumb|right|Konishi's twitter image comparing the aspect ratio of his original drawing (left) to the in-game version of Zuikaku Kai Ni (right) on October 30th, 2015]]
On October 30th, 2015, following the release of her second remodel, there was a discrepancy with Zuikaku's image that the artist, Konishi, took notice of once he saw her new art in-game. Konishi would later tweet that her aspect ratios got squashed down a little bit. There was a noticeable difference in the image used in-game versus his original concept. Later that same day the developers took notice and announced they would be patching in the correct image the following day. The image has since been replaced with the correct version. It was revealed that Konishi had simply sent the wrong file to the devlopers as there were many revisions to Zuikaku's new design. The tweets in which Konishi noted the mistake and those containing the comparison images were later removed. [https://twitter.com/C_o_nisi/status/660178260391628800]
