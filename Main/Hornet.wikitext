{{:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Equipment Bonuses}}

===Analysis===
Priority: '''High'''

: She has decent firepower with excellent plane counts and slot distribution. The size of her top slot make it highly unlikely that they will be emptied and gives her a very powerful airstrike. Her 2-3rd slot are of decent size that gives her the option of adding to her airstrike power or bringing fighters. While she may be event-only, she is absolutely worth the effort to obtain.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Air Support
* Shelling Support
* Airstrike Support
