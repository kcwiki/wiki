To assign or swap a ship girl in your fleet, you simply need to click the '''Change (変更)''' button. This will bring up a list of all the ship girls you possess. You can change how the girls are sorted by clicking on the blue button in the top right and cycling through the following options: 

*'''Level''' - Sorts from highest to lowest level.
*'''Ship Type'''- Sorts by ship type and ID. 
** You can filter the ship types shown by using the tabs along the top of the ship girl list. '''This option is only available for the browser version'''.
*** Clicking ◀ on the right will (de-)select all tabs
*** Clicking on the small circle on the left will toggle between IJN and Royal Navy Ship Hull classifications

====Removing Ship Girls====
There are two ways to remove a ship girl from your fleet: 

# Select the ship girl you want to remove and press the '''Change (変更)''' button. Then select the '''Undo (はずす)''' at the top of your ship girl list. '''This option is at the top of every page in the browser version but only at the top of the first page in Android'''. <br>The 1st fleet flagship (secretary ship) cannot be removed and can only be swapped out.

# The second way is to select the '''"Remove All but Flagship" (随伴艦一括解除)''' option located at the top. This option will remove all ship girls but the flagship.

====Adjusting Fleet Positions====
[[File:Clickinganddraggingcomp.png|thumb|right|The example shows how to move a ship girl from position 2 to the flagship position.]]
You are able to click and drag ship girls around to adjust their position in the fleet. To do this, click on the ship girl's portrait and drag her to the desired position. She will swap places with the girl in that position.

You can also use this method to quickly remove girls from the fleet by clicking and dragging her portrait off the fleet slots.

=Locking Ship Girls=
You can lock ship girls to prevent them from being available for [[Modernization]] or Dismantling. To lock a ship girl, click the '''Change (変更)''' button to bring up the ship girl list and mouse over the empty space on the right of the list. A greyed out unlocked padlock will appear. Click on it to lock a ship girl.

'''Always remember to lock the ship girls you wish to keep'''.

=Preset Fleets=

Fleet presets allows you to save fleet compositions and load them quickly. All players start with '''3 preset fleets''' but can unlock more by purchasing a '''Dock Key''' (1000 yen) from the [[Shop|Item Shop]]. You can currently have a total of '''17 Preset Fleets'''. 

===Recording Presets===

You can also unlock more fleet preset slots from this menu. Locked slots will be displayed at the bottom of the list. If you have Dock Keys in your inventory, you can click the '''Unlock''' button to increase the number of fleet presets.

'''Important Notes'''
* The fleet name will be recorded as well. Anytime you deploy this fleet, the name will change to the recorded one.

* The fleet name will be overwritten with the saved name.
* You can deploy ship girls that are in the docks.
* If a ship girl in the preset is no longer part of your forces, '''"Decommissioned Ship" (除籍艦)''' will be displayed in her place.
