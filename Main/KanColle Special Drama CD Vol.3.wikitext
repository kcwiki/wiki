==Part 1==
<i><nowiki>**Bird chipping**</nowiki></i>

[[Suzuya]]: Yooo! Kumano? Waking up?

<i><nowiki>*Suzuya walks into Kumano's room an proceed to wakes up Kumano**</nowiki></i>

[[Kumano]]: Uhm, ehm… What’s going on? Suzuya… Why in the world are you so loud from the very morning?

[[Suzuya]]: What the… Kumano? Still asleep, I see… Quick, wake up! Here, brought you this.

[[Kumano]]: *yaaawn* I went to bed late last night. If I don’t have plenty of my beauty sleep, I will… *yaaawn* It’s coooold…

[[Suzuya]]: Right? It’s getting pretty cold. Let’s eat together. Come, come.

[[Kumano]]: Suuzuyaa! It’s cold, so stop it already! Cold!

[[Suzuya]]: Ehehe, Kumano you sleepy head!  Anyway, start dressing up. I want a cold watermelon, so let’s use the ice I put aside.

<i><nowiki>**Suzuya walks off to prepare the watermelons**</nowiki></i>

[[Kumano]]: Suit yourself…. Eeeeh… It was such a nice dream. Aaaah…

<i><nowiki>**Cicada chipping**</nowiki></i>

<i><nowiki>**Cicada chipping**</nowiki></i>

<i><nowiki>**Suzuya takes a bite out of the watermelon**</nowiki></i>

[[Suzuya]]: So sweet.

<i><nowiki>**Kumano takes a bite out of the watermelon**</nowiki></i>

[[Kumano]]: Isn’t it? Such a great taste.

[[Suzuya]]: Kumano… Do you like watermelons?

[[Kumano]]: Hehe, of course I like them.

[[Suzuya]]: Riiight? Oh, a seed. Pfu, pfu.

[[Kumano]]: What are you doing, Suzuya? Spitting in your own garden! It’s a bit vulgar!

[[Suzuya]]: Eeeeh?! Ain’t it alright? Just do it like that. Eat a watermelon at the veranda in the base and… Pfu! Pfu! Oh! Amazing, how they flew! Did you see it, Kumano? Just now!

[[Kumano]]: I did indeed see it. But Suzuya, I’m not doing it. Fruits are refined gifts!

[[Suzuya]]: … I give up. On the other hand… I was wondering when to mention it, but…

[[Kumano]]: What do you mean?

[[Suzuya]]: Kumano, you see… Eating watermelon with knife and fork is kinda… weird, you know?

[[Kumano]]: This, is a formal way of eating fruits.

[[Suzuya]]: Uhm, really? Girl eating watermelon this way… Kumano’s the only one in the fleet.

[[Kumano]]: That is certainly not true! Girls who came from the Europe also do it at Mamiya’s…

[[Suzuya]]: Uhm… That’s… That’s a bit different, ain’t  it? Anyway, what are you doing with the seeds?

[[Kumano]]: Watermelon seeds? This is how you should do it: after cutting the watermelon, you take them out with a fork before putting them in your mouth.

[[Suzuya]]: Eeeh? Are you seriously doing such a thing?

[[Kumano]]: I don’t like when there are seeds, after putting it in my mouth…

[[Suzuya]]: What are you talkin’ ‘bout? Pfu! Pfu! Here, holding the skin… Omnomnom… Gorgeously! Pfu! Pfu! You make the seeds fly! That’s the best, ain’t it!? Aaaah… so happyyy.

[[Kumano]]: Suzuya.

[[Suzuya]]: What?

[[Kumano]]: It’s vulgar.

[[Suzuya]]: Uhm? That’s not true!

[[Kumano]]: Yes, it is!!!

[[Suzuya]]: No, it ain’t!

[[Kumano]]: It is!

[[Suzuya]]: It’s because you are weird!  Anything is elegant if you eat it with knife and fork? Eh? Are you stupid?

[[Kumano]]: Stu… What does it mean?!

[[Suzuya]]: Stupid means stupid, right? Kumano, stupid!

[[Kumano]]: Only stupid says “stupid”!

[[Suzuya]]: Ah? Got you angry? Kumano’s a kid, eeeh? Ahaha! Kumano, stu…

[[Kumano]]: *BAM* I! Will spend the afternoon alone!

[[Suzuya]]: Aa… Ku…mano?

[[Kumano]]: Have a great day!

<i><nowiki>**Kumano storms out of the room and slams the door**</nowiki></i>

[[Yura]]:  Oh! Kumano-san! Good morning.

<i><nowiki>**Kumano runs past Yura**</nowiki></i>

[[Yura]]: Eh?

----

<i><nowiki>**Yura opens the door to Suzuya and Kumano's room**</nowiki></i>

[[Yura]]: Uuuhm…

[[Suzuya]]: Oooh! Yuracchi! Mornin’!

[[Yura]]: Suzuya-san, sorry for intruding on your day off. Admiral’s asking about the 7th Squadron task planned for the beginning of the week…

[[Suzuya]]: Ooh, the data. Thank you!

[[Yura]]: Uuuhm… What happened to Kumano-san?

[[Suzuya]]: Aaah, it’s nothing. She’s out shopping for a bit.

[[Yura]]: Ah.. Oh, yes… Here’s the data.

[[Suzuya]]: Oh, got it!

[[Yura]]: Well then… Yura’s going back.

[[Suzuya]]: Aaaye! Thanks for work!

[[Yura]]: … Suzuya-san.

[[Suzuya]]: ‘Sup?

[[Yura]]: Is everything fine?

[[Suzuya]]: What’s… Everything’s fine!

[[Yura]]: Then… I’ll see myself out.

[[Suzuya]]: Aaaye! Good workie! Say hi to admiral!

<i><nowiki>**Yura leaves the room**</nowiki></i>

<i><nowiki>**Cacidas Chirping**</nowiki></i>

[[Suzuya]]: Everything’s fine… it’s fine…

[[Suzuya]]: Stupid Kumano…
