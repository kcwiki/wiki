==Introduction==
Z1型駆逐艦に搭載された、かの国の駆逐艦主砲です。<br>
単装砲ではありますが、対艦・対地射撃では優れた火砲です。<br>
本兵装は残念ながら対空戦闘には不向きです。

This was the main gun of destroyers from that country. It was equipped on the Z1 class of destroyers.<br>
Although it was just a single-mount, it was a good gun for anti-ship and anti-ground shelling.<br>
Unfortunately, this gun is unsuited for anti-air combat."
