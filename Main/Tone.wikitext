==Trivia==
*She is named after the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_River Tone River].
* Tone was sunk on 24 July 1945 by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USN USN ]aircraft from the light carrier ''USS Monrerey'' at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kure,_Hiroshima Kure, Hiroshima] ([http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_cruiser_Tone_%281937%29&params=34_14_N_132_30_E_ 34°14′N 132°30′E]). She was raised and scrapped over the course of 1947 and 1948.
* The reason why Tone only has turrets on her right side is because both Tone and Chikuma mounted all four turrets of their main battery forward of the main mast. The rear deck was equipped with a heavy AA battery and a complicated track and turntable system that allowed the quick launch of all 5 (compared to the 3 that all other cruisers carried) of her floatplane reconnaisance aircraft. This is depicted in her original form as a white pattern on her left sock, and on the skirt of her cheongsham in her Kai Ni form.
* Received her Kai Ni on 23/04/2014, together with Chikuma and Bismarck.
