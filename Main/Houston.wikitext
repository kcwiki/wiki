'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''

She has accuracy and firepower bonuses when equipped with certain medium guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
'''Houston Kai'''

Priority: '''Low'''

:At first remodel, this American heavy cruiser has decent Firepower but a low Torpedo stat, making her usable for daytime surface combat thanks to [[Artillery Spotting]] but not so much for night battle.

:No further remodels have been implemented for her yet (as of November 2020).


====Recommended Roles====
* Surface combat

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Night battle

==Trivia==
* The ribbon in her collar is a Navy Presidential Unit Citation
* The white color scheme of Houston's base form reflects the peacetime colors of the US Navy. The darker colors of Houston's Kai form appear to represent USN camouflage Measure 1, the USN's "default" camouflage for the war.
* ''Houston'''s survivors, alongside survivors of a battalion of the U.S. Army on Java (the "Lost Battalion"), were captured by the Japanese. The majority were forced into hard labor on the Burma Railway, which is (fictionally) portrayed in ''The Bridge on the River Kwai''
