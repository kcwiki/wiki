==Introduction==

急降下爆撃も可能な高性能多用途水上偵察機「瑞雲」。<br>
航空戦艦「伊勢」「日向」等での海上での艦隊運用を前提に編成され、錬成を重ねた六三四航空隊所属の「瑞雲」飛行隊。<br>
実際に航空戦艦での艦隊運用は叶いませんでしたが、<br>
その精鋭「瑞雲」隊は、今ここに。

''A highly efficient multi-purpose "Zuiun" reconnaissance seaplane that is also capable of dive bombing.''<br>
''This is a "Zuiun" air force that was assembled for surface fleet operations with ships like aviation battleships such as Ise or Hyūga, and that was part of the veteran Air Group 634.''<br>
''While it did not actually get to operate from aviation battleships in the end, now is your chance to deploy this elite Zuiun group.''
