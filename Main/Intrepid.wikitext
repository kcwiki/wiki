{{clear}}

===Analysis===
Priority: '''High'''

: She has decent firepower with excellent plane counts and slot distribution. The size of her top two slots make it highly unlikely that they will be emptied and gives her a very powerful airstrike. Her 3rd slot is also a respectable size that gives her the option of adding to her airstrike power or bringing fighters. While she may be event-only, she is absolutely worth the effort to obtain.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Air Support
* Shelling Support
* Airstrike Support

==Trivia==
* She is named after the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Intrepid_(1798) USS Intrepid].
**She is the 4th ship to bear the name.
* [[Kensuke Tanaka]] has noted in his [[Kensuke_Tanaka_Interview:_Famitsu_Weekly_May_27th,_2018|Famitsu 2018 Interview]] that he traveled to the United States back during his days as a University Student and got to visit the actual museum ship Intrepid. He noted that his visit with the Intrepid was one of the few things the help play a role in his inspiration with his plans to work on Kantai Collection.
* [[Kensuke Tanaka]] also notes that Intrepid's marriage line inspired by a quote from one of Shintani's works which may have come from either ''Area 88'' or ''Phantom Burai'' which he quotes was "How good would it be if this were all a game?" which also served as part of his inspiration. 
** The above mentioned quote was likely slipped in by [[Kensuke Tanaka]] as a shout-out reference to his past when he went onboard the Intrepid.
