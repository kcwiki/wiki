==Introduction==
The Summer 2015 Event "Counterattack! The Second Operation SN" is slated to start on August 10, 2015, and will last for about 20 days. The event will be based on ''Operation SN,'' the Japanese plan to establish air bases in the southern Solomon Islands; however, there was no actual second Operation SN historically.

This will be a large-scale event that will contain combined fleet operations and ship locking mechanics. There will also be a new system introduced into the game that will be equipment related.

==Patch Notes==
1.
The Summer 2015 event "Counter attack! The 2nd SN operation" has started and will last for twenty days.

2.
The main part of the "Counter attack! The 2nd SN operation" event consists of four maps:
*E-1 "Preparation, the 2nd SN Operation!"
*E-2 "Combined Fleet, to the Solomon Sea!"
*E-3 "Charge! The 2nd South Pacific Battles"
*E-4 "To the Strait! Destroy the Enemy Airfield!"

3. 
Clearing the main part will award you with the following new ships:
*Destroyer [[Kawakaze]] from E-2.
*[[Hayasui]], the first ''fleet oiler'', from E-4.

4.
E-2 and E-3 each require a [[Combined Fleet]].
*The first fleet is the main and the second is the supporting fleet; you can drag the icon from 2 to 1 to create combined fleet.

5.
'''''Item rewards 1/3'''''
E-3 will award you with the new plane "Type 97 Torpedo Bomber (Murata squadron)"; completion of a quest will allow you to upgrade it.

6.
'''''Item rewards 2/3'''''
Clearing the individual maps will award you with items and consumables including [[Reinforcement Expansions]], [[Battle Rations]], and [[Maritime Resupply]].

7.
'''''Item awards 3/3'''''
Choosing different difficulties will reward different amounts of items, though you can get the "Type 97 Torpedo Bomber (Murata squadron)" on all difficulties.

==Mechanics==
===Participation requirements===
*Must have a 75% sortie win ratio.
*Must have 5 empty ship slots for new ships.
*Must have 20 free equipment slots.
===Special Mechanics===
# The difficulty system first used in [[Spring 2015 Event]] returns: you can choose between Operation A (甲, Hard), Operation B (乙, Medium) or Operation C (丙, Easy).
#* Choosing A or B requires certain HQ Level (HQ Lv 35 for B / 80 for A in Spring 2015 Event).
#* With the exception of E-1, in order to choose Operation A, the previous map must be cleared on A or B.
# A new system will be introduced with the release of this event involving carrier-based planes.
# The [[Air Reconnaissance]] system introduced in 6-3 makes a reappearance in E-5, utilizing your recon planes equipped to your ships to gain more resources after winning at the boss node.
# '''Official tweets have confirmed that there are "supply bases" on the map that will lower the armor of the boss node. This has been confirmed to be the case in E-7. Clearing supply bases lowers the boss armor until midnight JST, at which point it is necessary to defeat the bases again.'''
#*The original theory teased was that winning sorties at the X nodes on E-3 and E-7 may be the key to lowering the boss armor and finishing the event.
#*This may also be the case on E-3.

*South route seems to have success with 2CL 4DD
*If going north, 1CL 2CVL 3DD seems to work. Note however that you go through a sub node and preboss has a Ri-class CA so this might not be worth the shiplocks.
*Since the tagging is shared with E-2, it may be worthwhile to use BBV / CAV / AV in the fleet, as the A - D - Z route has no enemy air power and this can guarantee air superiority.

*Node B is a submarine node; it will not consume ammo.
*Going south route with a Surface Task Force will conserve bauxite but cost more ammo and fuel. There is no enemy air power, but there are a few ships with decent anti-air capability. 
**Having a BBV or CAV is recommended to gain air superiority. Consider adding in a single CVL full of bombers and a [[Saiun]]
*Going north route with a Carrier Task Force will conserve a bit more fuel but has much higher bauxite costs. There are three aerial battles. Nodes F and H have fs kai Wo-class with takoyakis.

**One can use no more than 1 CLT and 2 CVs to avoid being sent to an additional aerial combat node.
**Consider fitting AP shells on your battleships for the boss node.
**Node C is considered much better for CTF on hard difficulty; node B has 2 CLT Chi-class Flagship and 1 CL He-class Flagship, which can wreck the escort fleet with their torpedoes (due to only 1 round of shelling).
**380-390 AS is required AT boss node on Hard to get AS, and the same is true on final form of Normal.

*Considering [[Mizuho]] is available at all difficulties (but appears to be S-rank only drop), and the difficult boss formations on Hard, unless your fleet is properly prepared, lowering the difficulty for this map may be wise. Note that the final form for normal difficulty is the same as the pre-final form for hard difficulty.

*Recommended compositions include:
**CTF: 2BB 2CV 2CVL / 2 DD 1 CL 1 FBB 2 CA
***A CLT can be subbed out for a CA or the FBB, but will be useless in E-6 as it results in a dead-end node.

|tips = 
*Node E and G are night battles
*Nodes E, F, G, and H have different compositions depending on whether the gauge puts the boss on final form, as well as whether you have cleared the map:
:*''If the boss is on final form'': These nodes also take on a final form (marked in the tables); nodes E and G have weaker enemies while nodes F and H have stronger enemies, making it more desirable to attempt the last kill through E and G.
:*''If the map is cleared'': Nodes E and F take on the easier makeup (final form for E, non-final form for F), where as nodes G and H can be either non-final or final form.
::*On Easy, there is 1 in 3 chance of seeing a high AS-required fleet at H (the H3 Pattern), which is not feasible to obtain via just 1 carriers, but otherwise north route would be much easier due to no enemy battleships until boss.
::*On Normal and higher, going through F and H will require similar support setup if you were using them, for node F still has the Ta-class Flagship in double line, and node H still has Wo-class Flagship with the new planes. For the night battle route, node G is the variable, but in any case you're counting on evasion no matter which pattern you get.
*Regarding boss, [[Airfield Princess]]:
:*She is an installation, so [[Type 3 Shell]] and [[WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)]] are desired for this map.
::If using 3 or more BB+CA(V), consider equipping a BB with AP shell (instead of [[Type 3 Shell]]) as flagship to eliminate escorts during daytime. This is especially important on hard due to the toughness of Ru-claas Flagship Kai.
:*Her fighter power doubles for the final kill, and her planes are much more lethal.
:*(Easy Only) During final attempts, because Ru-class Elite does not have recon planes, there is no need to try to get AS for the node. You may simply add another ship, such as CLT (to clear out escort ships) or another ship capable of equipping Type 3 Shells.
:*Boss Support Expedition is highly advised.
*Suggested Compositions:
:*2BB 2DD 2CVL (B -> D -> F -> H -> Z)
::*Pro: Less problem at node H if AS is obtained.
::*Con: May lack the ability to finish the boss.
:*2BB 2DD 1CA(V) 1CVL (B -> D -> F -> H -> Z or B -> D -> E -> G -> Z)
::*Pro: Has more punch than the above formation to finish the boss.
::*Con: Either risk taking more damage at H or go through night battle nodes.
::For comparison, [[Chitose#Chitose Carrier Kai 2|Chitose]] with Reppu Kai (chevron), Reppu (chevron), and Shiden K2 (chevron) [127 fighter power before modifier] can gain AS at node H against Pattern 1, but can only get air parity against Pattern 2.
:*3BB 2CA(V) 1CV (B -> D -> E -> G -> Z)
::*Pro: Night battle route good for attempts on final form due to F and H nodes reported to be harder.
::*Con: Night battle nodes are always chancy.
:*2BB 1CV 2DD + [[Ryuujou]] (B -> D -> F -> H -> Z)
::*Pro: This allows better air power at H to possibly gain AS (if Ryuujou is used).
::*Con: Admirals may already have RJ locked to other maps.
:*2BB 1CV 2DD 1CL (B -> D -> F -> H -> Z)
::*Pro: Alternative of the formation above, but sacrifices AS for utility of a CL. Best used if a high-capacity CV is used (such as Kaga). Bonus if CL brought is [[Abukuma#Second Upgrade|Abukuma Kai Ni]] because of her opening torpedo.
::*Con: Depending on difficulty chosen, H node may still be air parity.

*Suggested Compositions:
:* 2 BBs (any variant), 1CAV, 2DD, 1CV: Guarantees node B, which allows avoidance of node C as well.
:* 2 BBs (any variant), 1CLT, 1CAV, 1DD, 1CV: has the highest damage output, but needs to go through a node C with 2 Ru-class in double line, which may be difficult to navigate.
*Akitsushima can help with routing to B as well, but you must compensate for her lack of combat capability. Compositions with her would run something like Akitsushima, 1DD, 2BB, 1CV, and 1 any other ship.

*Nodes A and E are both submarine nodes.
*Nodes G and J are Active Branching nodes.
*'''Having SS or CLT will prevent you from reaching the boss!'''
*(Hard Only) At node F, there are two patterns with the exact same enemy makeup; the only difference is that in one of the patterns the dive bomber on Wo-Class Flagship does not have the red aura.

*Fleet Makeup and Routing:
:*Carrier Task Force: Recommended here due to the numerous carriers littered on this map.
::*Makeup should be 4CV 2BB + 1CL 2~3DD 2CA(V) 0~1FBB due to the inability to use CLTs and a maximum of 2 CA(V)s allowed.
::*Routing:
:::*C->E->G->H->L->Z: Goes through an aerial battle node (H).
::::Node L is the hardest node in this route, because there's a 50% chance to see Wo-Class Kai at this node (on normal/hard). This route, however, only guarantees to see Tsu-class at C and Boss (50% chance to see at H), so there is less bauxite usage.
:::*C->E->G->F->J->K/M->Z: Goes through a normal battle at F.
::::Unless you are farming for Kazagumo (which can drop from node M as well as boss), node K is the choice here; node K only has 1 Wo-Class Kai with the new takoyaki-type planes (as opposed to node M which may have up to 2 additional Wo-Class with the new planes depending on difficulty and pattern faced).
:*Surface Task Force: '''Not Recommended''', but this fleet does have the capability to reach boss.
::*Makeup should be either ''3FBB, 2 Fast CVL, 1CA(V) + 1CL 4DD 1CA(V)'' or ''3FBB 1CV 2CA(V) + 1CL 4DD 1CA(V)'' due to the threat of node D (night battle node against a fleet led by either CA Ri-Class Flagship, Ri-Class Flagship Kai, or BB Ru-Class Flagship Kai on easy/normal/hard respectively).
::*Your routing will be A->B->F->J->K->Z (M is not recommended on this setup)

*Nodes '''B, F and I''' are <span style="color:red">submarine nodes, '''and do not inform you beforehand.'''</span> Take appropriate care when approaching them.
*Node K is an Air Battle Node.
*No CLTs are allowed. They will result in dead-end nodes.
**'''It is confirmed that killing the flagship of nodes X and Y 3 times each will make the boss easier to kill.'''. The stat decrease is not shown in displayed boss's statistics.
::*The current Japanese consensus is that the effect '''increases the [[Combat#Critical_Modifier|critical modifier]]''' above 150% (which is the normal value).
::*Players have reported that the decrease is '''not''' reset when difficulty is changed.
::*'''''This effect <span style="color:red">resets</span> daily at midnight JST.''''' This map regenerates '''stats''', not the health bar.
*[[wikipedia:Comptiq|Comptiq magazine]]'s September issue revealed that S-ranking the X and Y nodes and sinking the transports in node C reduced the [[Air Defense Princess]]' armour.

*Suggestions:
:*Unlike other maps, the gimmick of reducing armor that resets at midnight JST means that this map is generally best done in longer sessions. 
:*For armor reduction runs:
::*'''Surface Fleet''' with [[Akitsu Maru]] will hit both nodes if not sent to A from B.
::*Fleet Makeup: 
:::''First Fleet'': Akitsu Maru + (CV or 2CVL) + rest CA(V)/BB (all variants)
:::''Second Fleet'': CL + 2DD + 2CA(V) + 1FBB
::*Equip Makeup:
:::BB/CA(V): 2 Main Guns, Seaplane ([[Zuiun|Bombers]] fine for CAV/BBVs), [[Type 3 Shell]]
:::Akitsumaru: 2 Fighters plus [[Fleet Command Facility]]
:::CVL: 2 Fighters, 1 bomber, plus Saiun or Fighter
:::CV: 3 Fighters plus either [[Type 62 Zero Fighter-bomber]] or another Fighter
:::CL: Sonar, Depth Charge, plus WG42 (or [[Type A Ko-hyoteki]] for [[Abukuma#Second Upgrade|Abukuma Kai Ni]]) 
:::DD: Sonar, Depth Charge, plus WG42 or Sonar.
::*Route is B -> X -> D -> H -> Y, and return to base after Y. Ensure you enter night battle at both nodes for S-rank. It may be possible to S-rank node X during the day, but not as likely for node Y.
:*For Chipping/Clearing runs:
::*'''Carrier Fleet''' is preferred because the map is littered with [[Standard Carrier Wo-Class#Kai|Wo-Class Kai]] even on the easiest difficulty.
::*Fleet Makeup:
:::''First Fleet'': 2BB + 4CV ''or'' 2BB + CA + 3CVL
:::''Second Fleet'': CL + 2DD + 2CA(V) + 1 (DD ''or'' CA(V) ''or'' FBB)
::*Equip Makeup:
:::*For Chipping runs:
::::''First Fleet'': 10 Slots of Fighters can gain AS+ everywhere (depending on expertise level and slot capacity). Note that enemy has good anti-air defense, so expect a lot of loss on the bombers. BB and CA(V) should use the normal [[Artillery Spotting|artillery spotting]] equipment setup, unless [[Maya#Second Upgrade|Maya Kai Ni]] is using her AACI in the first fleet.
::::''Second Fleet'': you don't need to necessarily go for the kill, so most of the time you can get away without using double attack gear. It's more important that you bring all three night battle equipment ([[Searchlight]], [[Type 98 Recon Seaplane (Night Scout)]], and [[Star Shell]]) to increase the effectiveness of your attacks.
:::*For Clearing runs:
::::''First Fleet'': Except on hard (which has the same stats throughout), the boss has better stats (including AA). Don't count on your carriers for damage because of bomber shot-downs.
::::''Second Fleet'': This is where you may need to consider bringing cut-in setups for ships that can reliably do so. Again, night battle equipment will make your job easier.
::*Your Route should (ideally) be E-> G -> J -> M -> Z. Consider retreating if you reach node Y, because (1) node L is rather difficult to pass unscathed and (2) you suffer from a 40% modifier to damage (instead of 80%) due to ammo remaining.
