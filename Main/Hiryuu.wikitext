==Trivia==
*Her name means "Flying Dragon".
*She has exceptionally high luck probably because she was the only survivor in Midway while ''[[Akagi]]'', ''[[Kaga]]'' and ''[[Souryuu]]'' were all sank by US air raids. Her planes raided and indirectly sank the U.S. Carrier ''Yorktown'' (''Hiryuu'' herself was later sank, too. ''Yorktown'' was damaged by ''Hiryuu'''s attack and later sank together with DD ''Hammann'' by I-168's torpedoes).
*The hole on her Kai Ni CG's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Hiry%C5%AB#mediaviewer/File:Hiryu_burning.jpg flight deck] when she gets damaged is a reference to the damage her real-life counterpart sustained when she was targeted by planes from the USS ''Enterprise'', USS ''Hornet'' and survivors of USS ''Yorktown'' taken in by the former two. She was struck by bombs which caused the forward portion of her flight deck to cave in. Although her propulsion was unaffected and she wasn't holed, the fires from the attack were uncontrollable. She was scuttled by torpedoes from ''[[Makigumo]]'' and it took some time before she sunk, as reported by one of ''[[Houshou]]'''s aircraft.
*Her planes were responsible for sinking the USS ''Arizona'' during the Attack on Pearl Harbor.
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuttling Scuttled] after the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Midway Battle of Midway], 5 June 1942.
*The main character of Capcom's Strider, Strider Hiryuu, is named after this ship. Interestingly, both characters' names share the same kanji.
*Received her Kai Ni on 06/06/2014.
