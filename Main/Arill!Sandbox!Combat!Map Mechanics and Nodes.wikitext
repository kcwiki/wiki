=Map Mechanics=

Maps are made out of nodes connected to each other through paths called '''edges'''. You may only access a given node by travelling through those edges. Each node is independent of each other, and your fleet state will carry over from node to node.

The route you will make through a given map is defined by your '''fleet type''' and '''fleet composition'''. Rarely, one or multiple '''specific ships''' may also alter routing; these ships are usually historically related to a map's thematic operation. Ship stats (mainly LoS) affects routing as well. Paths that require a given LoS requirement to be met will show an animation of a Recon plane going back and forth towards the destination node. Additionaly, routing might be simply '''random'''.

There are a few mechanics that take place in the map itself.

==Land Base Air Raid==
In maps where a Land Base is present, an additional mechanic may be imposed where an enemy abyssal fleet will attack the allied Land Base. A text alert saying '''"Enemy formation approaching! Enemy aircraft are approaching our base." (敵編隊接近中！我が航空基地に敵機接近中。)''' will appear in the map screen and the Raid will follow shortly. Raids may trigger whenever you travel to another node.

Please refer to the [[Arill/Sandbox/Combat/Map_Mechanics_and_Nodes#Land Base Air Raid|LBAS]] page for additional details.

==Map Unlocking / Phase Progression==
In some maps, particularly during Events, conditions might be required to further progress the map. A map may be split in distinct phases, with each phase requiring a different set of objectives to be met. These objects range between successfully defeating enemy fleets, defending against enemy Air Raids, attaining air superiority on certain nodes, beating previous bosses, and so on. As soon these conditions are met, the map advances to the next phase; new nodes and/or paths will be unlocked, older paths might become inaccessible, and older routes might change severely.

Resetting a map by '''choosing a higher difficulty''' will reset the map to its initial state.

=Nodes=

===Full Battle Nodes===

These nodes have as the main objective engaging the enemy fleet and destroying the enemy flagship and/or the enemy combatants as a whole.

|Normal Battle Nodes are the main types of nodes present in a sortie, often times making up for the majority of nodes in the map. A Battle Node will always begin with Day Battle and can be followed up by a Night Battle. '''''Node'' Support Expedition''' may appear in these nodes.

Specifically for Battle Nodes, the battle cost varies depending on the node composition.

The applicable '''Support Expedition''' will trigger when the battle starts (during the night), but Day-only phases such as [[Arill/Sandbox/Combat/Land-based Aerial Support|LBAS]] and [[Arill/Sandbox/Combat/Aerial Combat]] will be performed as soon the Day Battle begins.
* As of 26/01/2021, Night to Day Battles are exclusive to events, with its last appearance on Fall 2017 Event.

|Boss Nodes are usually the final point of a map's route and are where the map's boss resides, if it has one. After the Boss Node battle ends, the sortie automatically finishes and the player fleet returns to Homeport. Boss nodes can be of any kind of battle node, meaning they can be a Night to Day Node, Night Battle Node, or a Battle Node. '''''Boss'' Support Expedition''' may appear in these nodes.

|The Start Node dictates the point from which your fleet will start.

Multiple start points may be present in the same map. In such cases, the Start Node from which you'll begin sortieing is defined by the fleet composition as well as fleet type when you enter the map.

|Upon entering the node, drains a specific value of a specific resource of your entire '''current fleet'''. This means that penalties derived from low levels of {{Fuel}} and {{Ammo}} are applied immediately. The strenght of Maelstroms can be mitigated by the number of ships independently carrying a RADAR. Maelstroms drain either {{Fuel}} or {{Ammo}}, but not both.

Certain Maelstrom are '''strong''', draining 150% more resources than regular Maelstroms and have roughly a 25% chance of draining all of a resource.

The result of this node determines the quantity of Transport Points (TP) deducted of a map's Transport Gauge after a successful Boss Battle with A-Rank or higher.

Simply reaching this node has no effect on the map's Transport Gauge.

If the Boss Battle is a failure with a C-Rank or lower, the resources are forfeit. Otherwise, a small message saying that the resources were secured will be shown in the lower right side of the victory screen.
