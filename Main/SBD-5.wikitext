''An improved version of the simple and sturdy masterpiece dive bomber.''<br>
''Despite being around since the early days of the war, it was deployed to the front lines in carrier task forces until the SB2C Helldiver had sufficient numbers to supplant it.''<br>
''Nicknamed the "Dauntless", it is a famous carrier-based dive bomber that is capable of limited air-to-air combat in the hands of a skilled pilot.''<br>
''This plane is an improved late-war model with a more powerful engine.''
