==Ship Bonuses (Tentative)==

{{:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/E-2/Historical_Ships}}

==General Information==
* There is 2 Land Bases available for you to use within the map. 
* There are 2 different tags for this map:
**{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag3}}Blue Tag: 3rd Fleet (Requirement: Combined Fleet or Single Fleet with CV) (Northern Start)
**{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag2}}Purple Tag: 6th Fleet (Requirements: Single Fleet with no CV) (2 Southern Starts)

==Phase 1: TP Phase==
This phase will require you to run a Single Fleet to deplete the TP bar at {{MapRoute|Q|red}}, consisting of a Ne-Class Kai and light escorts
There are currently two known compositions to complete this phase:

<tabber>
|-|Light Fleet Comp=
* Recommended Fleet:{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag2}}{{ToolTip|[Purple Tag]|'''6th Fleet'''}} 1 CL 1 CAV/AV 4 DD ('''FAST''')
* Route: {{MapRoute|A|blue|B|red|E|red|H|red|J|green|Q|red}}
* LBAS: {{MapRoute|Q|red}} 5 Range (no Airpower)
* Notes: Support expeditions are optional. You can use vanguard formation to pass the surface nodes
* LoS: About '''44+/34+/27+/23+ Cn3''' on '''Hard/Medium/Easy/Casual''' is required to route from {{MapRoute|J| green}} to {{MapRoute|Q|red}} with this comp.
* Will deplete the TP Gauge fast compared to the Submarine Composition.
* May result in extra bucket being spent while doing the runs.
* Will also result in additional ship being locked the map.
|-|Submarine Comp=
* Recommended Fleet:{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag2}}{{ToolTip|[Purple Tag]|'''6th Fleet'''}} 6SS(V)
* Route: {{MapRoute|A|blue|B|red|D|blue|H|red|J|green|Q|red}}
* LBAS: {{MapRoute|H|red}} 4 Range (no Airpower), {{MapRoute|Q|red}} 5 Range (no Airpower)
*Notes: Only recommended if you have some [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank]]s and [[Drum Canister]] carrying Subs (Luigi Torelli Kai or higher).
* Sub Fleet will be almost safe from any harm through the map as long as a land base is placed in Node H and Q. 
* However, the amount of TP drain per run will be very low, requiring more runs to be taken (Around 40-50 runs depending on the equipment you have).
* This can be ideal if you plan to conserve ships for tagging in later sections of the event.
* This can also be helpful in conserving buckets that would otherwise be spent in this map using a surface related composition.
* LoS: The LoS check from {{MapRoute|J| green}} to {{MapRoute|Q|red}} is ignored if using a full fleet of 6 SS(V).
**Based on current data, using less than 3-4 SS(V) in a fleet may result in off-routing to {{MapRoute|L|blue}} regardless.

==Phase 1.5: Unlock the route to Node U==
Unlocking {{MapRoute|U|red}} has two requirements:

| Reach
| S x2

<tabber>
|-|Node C=
** Composition:{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag2}}{{ToolTip|[Purple Tag]|'''6th Fleet'''}} 1SS (You can equip a damage control fairy on your submarine in case of taiha on {{MapRoute|F|Red}})
** Route: {{MapRoute|A|blue|B|red|D|blue|F|Red|C|Blue}}
** LBAS: N/A
|-|Node P=
** Composition:{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag3}}{{ToolTip|[Blue Tag]|'''3rd Fleet'''}} Carrier Task Force (CTF): 2 FBB 2 CV 2 CA + 1 CL 5 DD ('''Fast''')
** Route: {{MapRoute|G|blue|K|red|M|red|N|red|P|red}}
** Alternatively, you can use a single fleet comprised of 3 CV(L), 2 (FBB or CA(V)), and a DD with a maximum of 2 CV to route {{MapRoute|G|blue|K|red|N|red|P|red}}
** LBAS: Range 7, AP/AS on Hard: 124/279
</tabber>

==Phase 2: Defeat CA Hime at Node U==
You can use the same fleet you used in the previous unlocking phase
* Composition:{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag3}}{{ToolTip|[Blue Tag]|'''3rd Fleet'''}} Carrier Task Force (CTF): 2 FBB 2 CV 2 CA + 1 CL 5 DD ('''Fast''')
* Route: {{MapRoute|G|blue|K|red|M|red|N|red|P|red|T|red|U|red}}
* Alternatively, you can use a single fleet comprised of 3 CV(L), 2 (FBB or CA(V)), and a DD with a maximum of 2 CV to route {{MapRoute|G|blue|K|red|N|red|P|red|T|red|U|red}}
* LBAS: Range 6, no Air Power
* Notes: AACI is heavily recommended due to three airstrikes on route. Support Expeditions are optional

==Phase 3: Defeat CV Hime at Node ZII==
In this phase, you will need to take out an Aircraft Carrier Princess. There are several compositions availabe depending on selected difficulty:
<tabber>
|-|Submarine comp=
* Composition:{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag2}}{{ToolTip|[Purple Tag]|'''6th Fleet'''}} 6 SS(V)
** The recommended composition for all difficulties
* Route: {{MapRoute|W|red|Z|red|ZI|red|ZII|red}}
* LBAS Range: 8 Range, AP/AS on Hard 103/231
* Notes: Node Support is recommended to help you pass through the 2 surface battle nodes. Boss Support Expedition is optional if you send LBAS to the Boss.
* LoS: '''29+/23+/21+/18+ Cn3''' on '''Hard/Medium/Easy/Casual''' is required to route from {{MapRoute|ZI|red}} to {{MapRoute|ZII|red}}.
|-|Surface /Sub Mix=
* Composition:{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag2}}{{ToolTip|[Purple Tag]|'''6th Fleet'''}} CL, AV/CAV, DD, 3 SS(V)
** Only should be considered if you lack submarines
* Route: {{MapRoute|V|red|W|red|X|red|Y|blue|Z|red|ZI|red|ZII|red}}
* LBAS Range: 8 Range, AP/AS on Hard 103/231
* Notes: Node Support is recommended. Boss Support is also recommended.
* LoS: '''29+/23+/21+/18+ Cn3''' on '''Hard/Medium/Easy/Casual''' is required to route from {{MapRoute|ZI|red}} to {{MapRoute|ZII|red}}.
|-|Surface / AS + Sub Mix=
* Composition:{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag2}}{{ToolTip|[Purple Tag]|'''6th Fleet'''}} AS, BBV, 2CLT, 2 SS(V)
** '''Easy and Casual Difficulty Only''' (Use this Composition in case of a lack of Submarines)
* Route: {{MapRoute|V|red|W|red|X|red|Y|blue|Z|red|ZI|red|ZII|red}}
* LBAS Range: 8 Range, AP/AS on Easy/Casual 88/197
* Notes: Node Support is recommended. Boss Support is also recommended.
* LoS: '''29+/23+/21+/18+ Cn3''' on '''Hard/Medium/Easy/Casual''' is required to route from {{MapRoute|ZI|red}} to {{MapRoute|ZII|red}}.
|-|Light Fleet Comp=
* Composition:{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag2}}{{ToolTip|[Purple Tag]|'''6th Fleet'''}} 2CL, 4DD
** '''Casual Only''' (Use this Composition in case of a lack of Submarines)
* Route: {{MapRoute|W|red|X|red|Y|blue|Z|red|ZI|red|ZII|red}}
* LBAS Range: 8 Range, AP/AS on Easy 88/197
* Notes: Vanguard formation can be utilized to help with passing rate. Boss Support is optional but recommended.
* LoS: '''29+/23+/21+/18+ Cn3''' on '''Hard/Medium/Easy/Casual''' is required to route from {{MapRoute|ZI|red}} to {{MapRoute|ZII|red}}.
