==Gameplay Notes==
===Special Mechanics===
* Gains a torpedo stat, the ability to perform closing torpedo attacks, and the ability to equip torpedoes on Drei.

===Overview===
'''Kai'''
* Average firepower and armour.
* Good HP. 

'''Zwei'''
* Good firepower and armour.
* Great HP.
* Requires blueprint.

'''Drei'''
* Good firepower and armour.
* Great HP.
* Good torpedo stat for a battleship.
* Requires blueprint.

===Fit Bonuses===
{{:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Equipment Bonuses}}
'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''
* She has accuracy bonuses and penalties when equipped with certain large guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''

: Both her Kai and Zwei have decent firepower and defensive stats for a fast battleship. She doesn't really bring anything else to the table other than that. Being an LSC-only ship and the added cost of a blueprint for her Zwei, it makes her not worth it.
: Her Drei gives her a torpedo stat that puts her on par with the Yamato-class for night battles but due to being unable to equip 51cm guns, she falls short. She also requires a second blueprint which is a steep cost for the minimal upgrade.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Night Battle
* Support Expeditions
