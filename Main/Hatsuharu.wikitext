==Trivia==
*Sunk in action, November 13, 1944 in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_Bay Manila Bay], Philippines, at [http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_cruiser_Kiso&params=14_35_N_120_50_E_ 14°35′N 120°50′E].
*Her name means "the beginning of Spring".
*The ''Hatsuharu'' class were originally intended to number a dozen, but ''Hatsuharu'' was found to be top-heavy.  ''[[Nenohi]]'' and ''[[Hatsuharu]]'' were completed and then modified to fix the issue, ''[[Wakaba]]'' and ''[[Hatsushimo]]'' were modified during construction (thus their different uniforms). (''Ariake'' and ''Yugure'', the last two, had barely been begun, and so were constructed differently).  The remaining planned six ships became the first six ships of the ''Shiratsuyu'' class.
*She received her Kai 2 with the 10/10/2014 update.
*Her outstanding AA stat at Kai Ni reflects to her historical upgrade after she had been struck from a US dive bomber off of Kiska on 17 October, 1942. ''[[Oboro]]'', who accompanied her, sank during the attack. After limping back to Paramushiro on her own steam, she was docked at Maizuru Naval Arsenal for repairs. During this time, she was outfitted with numerous [[25mm Twin Autocannon Mount|Type-96 25mm AA guns]] and a [[Type 22 Surface RADAR]]. In this game, she is instead outfitted with a [[25mm Triple Autocannon Mount]] and a [[Type 13 AIR RADAR Kai]] to represent her great AA capabilities.
*She is required for [[Quests#A48|quest A48]].
