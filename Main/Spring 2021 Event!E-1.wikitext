==Ship Bonuses (Tentative)==

{{:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/E-1/Historical_Ships}}

==General Guidelines==

E-1 is a 3.5 Phase Map with the 31st Squadron Lock Tag (Green) consisting of three HP Phases and a minimal Unlock. One base of Land Based Aerial Support (LBAS) is available to sortie on this Map. Due to the span of different combat types on this map (Surface, ASW, Anti-Installation) it is recommended to take ships that are good at multiple of these categories to avoid locking too many ships to this map.

==Phase 1: Defeat the Ru-Class Patrol at Node J==

The goal of this phase is to deplete the HP Bar and defeat the Ru Class Battleship at {{MapRoute|J|Red}}. There is a submarine node and light surface squadron on the way, while the boss itself consists of only surface ships.

* Recommended Fleet: 1CL 0-1AV 4-5DD ('''Fast Fleet''')
* Route: {{MapRoute|E|Blue|D|Red|G|Blue|F|Red|J|Red}}
* LBAS: Range 7, no Airpower
* Additional Notes: Vanguard Formation can be utilized to help with preboss sub node. Support Expeditions are not needed

==Phase 1.5: Unlocking the Path to the Second Boss==

To unlock the path to the second Boss, you simply have to reach {{MapRoute|K|Blue}} once.

* Recommended Fleet: 1CL 0-1AV 4-5DD ('''Fast Fleet''')
* Route: {{MapRoute|E|Blue|D|Red|G|Blue|I|Red|K|Blue}}
* LBAS: Range 7, no Airpower
* Additional Notes: There is no surface combat on route, only ASW and Anti-Air Combat. If you get critically damaged at {{MapRoute|I|Red}} you can still proceed the sortie as the Route to the non-combat node {{MapRoute|K|Blue}} is fixed.

==Phase 2: The Benchmarkening (Defeat Supply Depot Hime)==

To complete this Phase, you need to deplete the HP Bar of the Second Boss {{MapRoute|Q|Red}}, consisting of a mix of Installations and PT Boats. Set up your Ships with the according equipment to deal with them as outlined [[Anti-Installation#Equipment_Setups|here]]. PT Imps are weak to AA Guns + Skilled Lookouts on your DDs. There are PT Imps and two pretty powerful airstrike on the way.

{{Landing Craft/Amphibious Tank Capable Ships}}
{{Anti-PT Imp Setups}}

* Recommended Fleet: 1AV/CL 4-5DD ('''Fast Fleet''') (On Hard, only a 5 ship fleet takes the shortest route)
* Route: {{MapRoute|L|Blue|M|Red|O|Red|P|Red|Q|Red}}
* LBAS: Range 5, (29/69/79/121) Airpower for AP at Last Dance (C/E/M/H)
* Additional Notes: Support fleets can be taken due to the presence of PT Imps.

==Phase 3: Defeat the Enemy Submarine Force!==

The goal of this phase is to sink the New Old Submarine Princess found at {{MapRoute|V|Red}} to deplete the HP Bar and clear the map. There is a surface engagement {{MapRoute|S|Red}}, a Submarine Node {{MapRoute|H|Red}} and high airpower air raid {{MapRoute|I|Red}} on route, but the Boss itself is an Anti-Submarine operation. AACI is highly recommended for this route, the surface Nodes can be passed using Vanguard formation as to not sacrifice too many equipment slots that should be occupied with ASW equipment.

* Recommended Fleet: 0-1 AV 0-1CLT 1-2CL 4DD ('''Fast Fleet''')
* Route: {{MapRoute|E|Blue|H|Red|I|Red|S|Red|V|Red}}
* LBAS: Range 2, no Airpower present at the Boss. {{MapRoute|I|Red}} has (138/144/149/229) AP for (C/E/M/H)
* Additional Notes:
* 1 Regular CL is required within the fleet composition
**LBAS can be Toukai sent to the Boss, Bombers to the Preboss Surface Nodes or a fighter sweep to Node I, depending on your surface fleet setup.
**The required LoS to reach the boss is '''Cn3 48+/38+/29+/29+''' on '''Hard/Medium/Easy/Casual'''
**'''3/2/1/1''' historical ships are required on '''Hard/Medium/Easy/Casual'''
