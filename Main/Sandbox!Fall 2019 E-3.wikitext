==Sandbox Rules==
This sandbox is to be used to construct an event guide for the above mentioned event map. These guides are to all of the following requirements:

* List of branching unlocking requirements (If there are multiple requirements, compositions for each path along with the below requirements will be needed to discuss the unlocking requirements in question)

* A list of working compositions that work: (These must have possible alternatives for players who may or may not have all ships needed for a specific path)

* The Path said composition will take (To explain what path the composition will take)

* A summary or description of what kind of obstacles a composition will face.

* A description of the boss node, what it consist and a descriptive guide on what the player should consider for a course of action to successfully win the battle.

* (Optional) Tips to farm to take path to collect certain ships (This will also require a composition, path, and possible description.

Editors are to construct thier own version of thier guide and complete them in a timely fashion. 

No other editors are to allowed to edit over other editor's work without the full consent of the editor and his approval to do so. 

Several version will be constructed through this page and will be reviewed and approved by the staff/ collaboration committee before being moved for the [[Fall 2019 Event]] which it'll be reviewed and updated once more before it can be released.

Overall there will be 3 version of the guide that will be constructed which will include:

*Preliminary Guide
*Polished Guide
*Finalized Guide

With each approval of each version the guide, the said guide will be updated to the main page and construction of the next version will begin.

All guides outside of the approved version will be removed and work will begin from the approved version to make it better for the next version until the finalized version is made.

===Totaku's Proposal===

'''Preperation'''

This map will give present the first Combined Fleet Battle for this event. While you are free to go about choosing how to approach this map, the most effecitive way to take care of this map will use either Transport Combined Fleet or a Surface Task Force to tackle the battle. 

Since this battle will serve as the Battle of the Java Sea. Ship affiliated with the battle from history will be most benifical in this map. Since there was a large number of ships the partook in the battle, there will be way more than enough options to select from this campaign. However it is still important to '''Choose Wisely on who to bring as others may become important for later maps''' 

In addition to this, '''depending on the ships you may have a possible serires of options you can consider for this map that you can choose.'''

Below are the following options you should consider before partaking in this map if you plan to do Normal or above:


#Do you have an Oiler you are willing to place within this map?
#* If yes, do you want to use battleships on this map to conserve some Heavy Cruisers?
#If no, are you willing to use [[Akitsushima]] on this map?
#* If yes, do you want to take advantage of a shorter route to get fuel and (optionally) repair ships?

If you reached an agreement, with the Oiler question, you can take advantage of a route that will allow you to use up to 2 larger ships on this map and still take the most effective routing.

If you said yes, to [[Akitsushima]], you can consider using her to take advantage of fuel hoarding if you lack in an oiler to do the job. But you will need to have a 2nd AV handy for later steps.

Depending on how you answer will decide what pathing route you can take.

'''Historical Bonuses'''

Since thie battle takes place as part of the Battle of the Java Sea. A large number of ships will be useful for here but as a reminder, '''choose wisely on who to bring as others may become important for later maps'''.

'''1.1x bonus'''

[[Chitose]], [[Mizuho]], [[Myoukou]], [[Naka]], [[Yuudachi]], [[Ikazuchi]]. [[Inazuma]], [[Minegumo]], [[Samidare]], [[Harusame]]

'''1.2x Bonus'''

[[Ashigara]], [[Haguro]], [[Nachi]], [[Jintsuu]], [[Ryuujou]], [[Yukikaze]], [[Sazanami]], [[Ushio]], [[Amatsukaze]], [[Tokitsukaze]], [[Yamakaze]], [[Kawakaze]], [[Murasame]], [[Matsukaze]].

'''All ship with historical ties will also get a 1.32x bonus at the 2nd boss node (Node O)

'''Step 1: Sink the [[Heavy Cruiser Ne-class]] Kai's fleet'''

In this path, your best methods of tackling this map is to bring either a '''Transport Combined Fleet''' or a '''Surface Task Force'''. Each combined fleet has their own unique path and challenges you'll face along the way toward your first target on the map. Below will be a summary of each comp that makes up each of the combined fleets and what you'll expect from them.

'''Transport Combined Fleet Method'''

'''LBAS Recommendation'''

'''LBAS 1''': '''4 Torpedo Bombers/ Land Base Bombers''' (Range 5 Needed)

At the boss node, you'll face off against the [[Heavy Cruiser Ne-Class|Heavy Cruiser Ne-Class Kai]] along with a group of CLs and DDs in a single Fleet. Depending on the difficulty, you will face enemies ranging all the way up to He-class flagship Kais accompanying the fleet. Having a Land Base full of bombers will make it more convenient wipe out the majority of the enemy fleet making it more possible to concentrate your fire upon the Ne-class. Given that it's armor is also very high, you will need a strong historical ship with TCI available to make it possible to score more wins from it if possible.

If you are able to do this and defeat the Ne-class effectively it should be possible to clear this node with little difficulty. But if you have problems feel free to bring boss support to help you have a better chance at winning against the Ne-class.

Once the Ne-class Kai is sunk, a new path will open to the 2nd boss node which will need to be completed to clear the map.

'''Step 2: Sinking the Battleship Water Demon'''

In this phase, you will be using a '''Surface Task Force''' as it will be the only way you can effectively be able to reach Node O. The enemy's you'll encounter will be the same as before so while the process will be the same, the path you will take will be to the next boss so below we'll review 3 of the most effective comps for the route.

<tabber>
|-|Oiler Comp=
* Composition: ''' 1AO 1(F)BB(V) 1 CVL 3CA(V)/CL + 1CL 4DD 1CAV/CLT'''
* Path: '''C-D-E-G-J-L-O'''
* Can bring the strongest possible comp to the boss node.
* You will encounter 2 Submarine Node and 2 Surface Battle
* Bringing 1-2 OASW in the fleet is recommended to improve you success rate against the subs on higher difficulties.
* Surface Battle will consist of CLs, CAs, and DDs.
* Depending on the difficulty, you will need to bring either only a small amount of Air Power or a larger on higher difficulties.
** Casual and Easy will only need 1 plane with fighting power to overpower all nodes.
** Normal will need an air power of 36 to AS or 72 to AS+
** Hard will need an air power of 198 to at least AS
|-|AV Comp=
* Composition: 1AV 3CA(V) 2 CL + 1CL 5DD
* Route: '''C-D-G-J-L-O'''
* You will encounter 1 Submarine Node and 2 Surface Battle

'''LBAS Recommendation'''

'''LBAS 1''':
* Casual/Easy: '''4 Torpedo Bombers/ Land Base Bombers''' (Range 6 Needed)
* Normal/Hard: '''0-1 Fighter , 3-4 Torpedo Bombers/ Land Base Bombers''' (Range 6 Needed)

At the boss node you'll encounter an enemy combined fleet consisting of a [[Battleship Water Demon]] (on hard mode, she'll start in her "damaged" form). along with a combined fleet consisting of CAs, CLs, and DDs.

In harder difficulties, her composition can include a CVL with high air power and even a Kai He-class flagship among the mix. Your fleet will need to be able to depend on the LBAS and achieving AS to have a chance to defeat the boss fleet. In addition, bringing historical ships will also give you a better chance at success along with bringing in a TCI DD (Preferably [[Ushio]] or [[Yukikaze]] to help wipe out the boss if necessary.

Once the HP bar closes near the end, you will face off against the Kai version of the Princess. Who will be more heavily armored and harder to take down without the assistance of your historicals. As per usual, night battle equipment is important and is necessary, bring a boss suport fleet to give you the edge you need to secure the win to complete the map.
