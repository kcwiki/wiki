===Analysis===
* Kai: '''Low'''
: She has low firepower for a light carrier which limits her damage potential. Her evenly distributed slots are not very good because they are all on the small side. This means her airstrike power isn't that good but it also means she can easily spread her damage more evenly against more targets. She'll work just fine for airstrikes against soft targets. Do keep in mind that she is slow so she'll have problems with speed restrictions.

* Kai Ni: '''High'''
: She gains a significant increase in firepower that makes her much better at combat. Her slots also get redistributed into a much more effective layout. She gains two larger slots with the largest slot being her first slot. This makes her a great shelling CVL. Do keep in mind that she is slow so she'll have problems with speed restrictions.

====Recommended Roles====
