===Analysis===
Priority: '''High'''

:A four slot light cruiser from the UK, similar to [[Ooyodo]], who brings lots of flexibility to the fleet.
:This turns her into an hard-hitting attacker against enemy installations when fitted with two [[WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)]].
:She has also a solid Firepower stat, making her a reliable daytime combatant with [[Artillery Spotting]], but her Torpedo stat is lower than average, reducing her usefulness at night.
:Her innate ASW stat is good, and the extra slots gives her an edge in the anti-submarine role, further increasing her versatility.

:No further remodels have been implemented for her yet (as of December 2020).


====Recommended Roles====
* Surface combat
* Anti-installation
* ASW

|origin =Town級軽巡洋艦、HMS Sheffield。軽巡と言っても、実際は重巡クラスの規模と火力を持つ重武装艦です。北極海での対ソ援助物資輸送船団の護衛、Bismarckの追撃戦など数々の戦いに参加しました。バレンツ海の戦いではドイツ艦隊を撃破、船団護衛に成功しています。
|translation =I'm the Town-class light cruiser HMS Sheffield. I'm classed as a light cruiser, but I'm as big and heavily armed as a heavy cruiser<ref>Due to limits on heavy cruisers imposed by the London Naval Treaty, the Town-class were armed with lots of 6" guns to make up the difference.</ref>. I participated in many battles, from escorting supply convoys to the Soviet Union in the Arctic to the pursuit of Bismarck. At the Battle of the Barents Sea, we defeated the German fleet and succeeded in our escort mission.

==Trivia==
*During the hunt for Bismarck, HMS Ark Royal's first attack wave of Swordfish torpedo bombers mistook HMS Sheffield for Bismarck and attacked her. Only faulty detonators on the torpedoes and fine ship handling saved her. It was Ark Royal's second wave (with different detonators) that crippled the Bismarck.
