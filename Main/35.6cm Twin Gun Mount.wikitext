==Introduction==
標準的な戦艦の主砲です。<br />
「金剛」型建造と同時期に英国に発注され、後に国産化、「伊勢」型までの標準的な戦艦主砲して運用されました。<br />
遠距離からの堂々たる艦隊砲撃戦を実現します。

A standard battleship main gun.<br>
It was ordered from the UK at the same time as Kongou. It was later produced domestically as the main gun of battleships up to the Ise-class.<br>
It is the grand realisation of long-ranged fleet artillery combat.

Originally being the 14 inch guns produced by Vickers, the Imperial Japanese Navy localized the gun under license and it subsequently equipped some of the earliest battleships of Japan, namely the Fuso, Kongou and Ise classes. The final main gun firing of the Imperial Japanese Navy during the war was recorded by this gun during the Kure air raid in July 1945, where a grounded Ise, Hyuga and Haruna fired their main guns in an anti-air role. Constantly modified and modernized throughout its lifespan, this was the very weapon that witnessed the Imperial Japanese Navy's rise and fall.

==Note==
Buildable. Stock equipment of all Kongou-class, Ise-class, and Fusou-class battleships.
