旧型駆逐艦に標準的主砲として搭載されました。<br />

''This is an old model small calibre gun. <br>It was equipped on older destroyers as their main armament. <br> Both loading and rotation was manual, but with its simple construction and low cost, it served a long time as main weapon of destroyers and coastal defense ships. It cannot be used for anti-air.''

This gun's basic structure was based on the British [[wikipedia:QF 4.7-inch Gun Mk I–IV|QF 4.7in. Mk.IV gun]], which was later produced domestically in Japan. The barrel of this gun was later mated to a high-angle mounting and served as AA guns for early Japanese heavy cruisers (ie. Furutaka-class to Takao-class. Both classes had their AA guns exchanged for [[12.7cm Twin High-angle Mount|12.7cm twin]] afterwards, but Chokai alone was equipped with 12cm singles throughout her career).
