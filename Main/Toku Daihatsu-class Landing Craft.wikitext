*'''Unbuildable.''' <br>
*September 2016 Rank Reward top 500 Equipment
*Can be modified from a [[Daihatsu]] via [[Akashi's Improvement Arsenal]] using [[Kinu|Kinu Kai Ni]]. 
*Increases expedition resources gain by 7% for each equipped Landing Craft, and can pass the 20% limit Daihatsu cap. 
*Toku Daihatsu do not a have a known existing cap to how much resources you gain from expeditions, however, they do still have a noted restriction that is dependent on how many Daihatsu and Toku Daihatsu you bring with you on an expedition.
* However, the resource gain when using Toku Daihatsu is still limited to 4 Toku Daihatsu.
* When using Toku Daihatsu along with the 20% resource gain from the [[Daihatsu]], the following results will occur to the resource gain.
**The First two Toku Daihatsu will give a 2% boost each to your resources, increasing your gain to 24%
**The Third Toku Daihatsu will give a 1% boost to your resources, increasing your gain to 25%
**The Forth Toku Daihatsu will give a 0.4% boost to your resources, increasing your gain to 25.4%
**If 4 Toku Daihatsu are used along with 4 [[Daihatsu]], they will aid in increasing the resource gain further but 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.1% and 0.1% respectively.
** This means that the overall base bonus resource gain you can earn from using '''4 [[Daihatsu]] and 4 Toku Daihatsu on the same fleet through expeditions is 26%'''. [https://twitter.com/Ex_witch/status/796644525317890048] [https://twitter.com/Ex_witch/status/797446805847822341]
*Applying 4 Maxed [[Daihatsu]] modification values ,you can '''reach up to 28%'''.
*Modification resource gain from [[Akashi's Improvement Arsenal]] with Toku Daihatsu are still unknown.
* Equipping these with a combination of a WG42 will add bonus damage against enemy installations where amphibious warfare mechanics apply (I.E 6-4)
