# Fixed graphics for [[Ushio]] and [[Ooshio]].
# 2 new destroyers [[Yayoi]] and [[Uzuki]]. Yayoi drops in Worlds 2 to 5, while Uzuki drops at boss nodes of Worlds 3 to 5. Yayoi can also be obtained through normal construction. (Note: It might be possible to construct Uzuki, but the staff is fixing this i.e. it's not supposed to happen.)
