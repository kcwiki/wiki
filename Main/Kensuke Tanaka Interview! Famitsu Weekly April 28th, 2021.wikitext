==8th Anniversary Interview==

'''Interviewer (I):''' Congratulations on KanColle's eight anniversary! We're now charging into the ninth year, huh.

'''Producer Tanaka (T):''' Thank you very much. For us in C2 Preparat, we've actually been together for ten years already if you start counting from the initiation of the project and development time. It all passed in the blink of an eye.

'''I:''' It's really been that long since the beginning of the project?

'''T:''' C2 has been working on it from the conception and planning stages, of course, to today in 2021, with the exception of the platform login and payment systems (handled by DMM-san). So we spent all that time doing this, that, everything. As we wrestled with doing new things or things we liked, we had to work nights and weekends and the weeks flew by. When I was a kid, the adults were always saying "time flies like an arrow" and I never believed them. Well, now I really get it.

'''I:''' Every so often C2 Preparat really will pull a rabbit out of its hat like its natural. More than once we've found ourselves saying, "They're doing what!?"

'''T:''' The reason we started the KanColle project was to share with people things they didn't know about the ships and people that fought on dark seas in the terrible war and were hurt or sunk, to make sure those ships and people weren't forgotten. Well, thanks to everyone's support we've basically hit 120% of that goal. I really am thankful to everyone that's supported us, those who lent their strength, and to all the admirals. Looking to the future, we're hoping to use KanColle as an opportunity to share wonderful or delicious things in life and to make opportunities to spend time with amazing people. Right now we're looking for wonderful things to experience beyond the screen. I'd be happy if KanColle could currently achieve even a portion of what I just mentioned.

'''I:''' Right! Everyone's got the names of not just the battleships and carriers, but also the individual destroyers down pat!

'''T:''' Indeed. CarDiv 1 and 2 are a given, but "Zuiun", "Special Type Destroyer", "DesRon 2" and more have all entered common usage among admirals, and I'm really glad about that. Plus, the areas around the old naval bases have been able to leverage KanColle to offer travel experiences, for people to find delicious food, expand their knowledge, and find new ways of thinking. I've been feeling more and more fulfilled as KanColle achieves its purpose and continues into its ninth year. Connecting past and present, and the future before us. That's my thoughts.

'''I:''' I see! In some way, that helps draw the line connecting the many events and collaborations C2 Preparat brings out with the game itself.

'''T:''' As for the game itself, Famitsu itself should be publishing information on this season's event toward the end of May. Preparations are proceeding apace to start we'll call the spring event. We're all looking forward to it!

'''I:''' What kind of event will it be?

'''T:''' The main operation highlights the journey of the Thirty-First Squadron starting from Taiwan and heading towards the Philippines, ending at Leyte.

'''I:''' The Thirty-First... Squadron?

'''T:''' A new surface ship division was assembled later in the war, as the damage inflicted by enemy submarines grew worse by the day, with the goal of finding and suppressing subs. The division was originally intended to carry equipment used to sweep for submarines, but by the final days of the war forces were so depleted that the division was employed to escort the mobile force, screen and patrol ahead of capital ships, and carry out transport missions under heavy fire. In other words, they were used in many ways.

'''I:''' I'll do some research on them before the event!

'''T:''' And as one of them, a Matsu-class destroyer will be implemented. Do look forward to this spring's new shipgirls! Halfway through the main operation, we transition to the Solomons. Starting with an air battle and the successes of submarine divisions there, before Lunga Point [Battle of Tassafaronga], where our elite torpedo squadrons' destroyers faced down cruisers many times their strength. The final map of the main operation will be based on that battle. 

'''I:''' Rabaul, the Rabaul Air Corps!

'''T:''' That's the ones! As our air corps suffered heavy losses day by day, the American pilots were being rescued by the well-crafted Catalina-class large seaplanes aggressively deployed around the front line, saving the lives of many skilled crew. The tactic and the crews are well worthy of respect. We're using this as the basis of the "Land-Based Air Corps Catalina Rescue" system which, if all goes well, we will be able to implement before the event and just before this issue of Famitsu.

'''I:''' So here's the Catalina's time to shine!

'''T:''' In the main operation there will also be a Yuugumo-class destroyer. The escort carrier whose back you can see a brief glimpse of now will come in the summer or later, but many more shipgirls such as an American heavy cruiser will be added! Do look forward to the extra operations as well!

'''I:''' We're almost out of time and page space, so please tell us a little non-game news as well!

'''T:''' The new KanColle anime with Engi-san and Kadokawa-san are well underway! We just had a recording session in the studio yesterday, and man, the voice actors were all wonderful, but (Fujita) Saki-san's Yamashiro was once again so wonderful... we're all so excited for it. As for the Kure Support Plan around the old Kure naval base, in order to continue under the present severe situation we're still working on local collabs remotely. If we get a chance and things calm down, we'd love if all the reading admirals could come visit!

'''I''': Thank you for all the discussion today! We'll be cheering on KanColle's ninth year!

'''T:''' No no, thank you!
