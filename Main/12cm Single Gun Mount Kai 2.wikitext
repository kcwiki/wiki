==Introduction==
旧型駆逐艦に標準的主砲として搭載された小口径主砲の改良型です。<br>装填・操砲も人力ですが、シンプルな構造で経済性も高く、駆逐艦や海防艦等の主砲として、長く使われました本兵装を戦訓を取り入れて改良、実戦時の運用性を大きく向上させています。<br>残念ながら対空射撃には不向きです。

An improved version of the small calibre main gun that was mounted as the standard main armament of older model destroyers.<br>
Although its loading and traverse mechanisms are still manual, its simple design and low cost has allowed it to remain the main gun of destroyers and coastal defence ships for a long time. This upgraded version incorporates lessons learned during the war to significantly increase its usability in combat.<br>
Unfortunately, it is unsuitable for anti-air combat.
