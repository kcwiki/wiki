{{:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Equipment Bonuses}}
{{clear}}
'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''
* She has accuracy and firepower bonuses when equipped with certain medium guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
'''Tenryuu Kai'''

Priority: '''Medium-Low'''

:At first remodel, she has destroyer-tier Torpedo, slightly higher Firepower but cannot equip seaplanes, making her one of the few light cruisers unable to perform [[Artillery Spotting]], thus limiting her efficacy in surface combat.
:Her low resource consumption makes her very suitable for expeditions, though.
:Furthermore, a decent ASW stat makes able to perform OASW at high-but-before-marriage levels with proper gear.


'''Tenryuu Kai Ni''' 

Priority: '''Low'''
:Her second remodel comes with only marginal stat increases except for a massive +40 AA boost, allowing her to perform in an anti-air role as well.
:Please note that, while she gains her own unique [[Anti-Air Cut-In]] attacks, those are inferior to the standard one and there's almost never a reason to use them.
:Unlike her sister [[Tatsuta]], she cannot be loaded with [[Daihatsu]].

====Recommended Roles====
* Expeditions
* ASW
* Anti-air (Second remodel)

===Important Info===
* Required for A8, A20, A24, A50, A51, A89, B11, B16, B41, B43, and B120.
* An option for BQ7.
