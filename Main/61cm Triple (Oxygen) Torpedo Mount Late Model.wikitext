''A large 61cm torpedo that was developed as the successor of the obsolete 53cm torpedo.''<br>
''The triple torpedo launcher was mounted onto various ships such as the special-type destroyers of the Fubuki-class as their main armament.''<br>
''This armament is an improved model where the original torpedoes were replaced with type 93 oxygen torpedoes and lessons learnt from actual combat were incorporated,''<br>
''resulting in a thoroughly improved and fine-tuned late-model oxygen torpedo equipment.
