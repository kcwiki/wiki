==Trivia==
The Fw 190 was arguably Germany's best fighter aircraft of WWII.  Fast, powerful, and well-armed, at its introduction in 1941 it was superior to the RAF's Spitfire Mk V in all respects save turn radius.  While no carrier-borne version was ever designed (the Messerschmitt Me 155 was designed during the brief resurgence in naval interest during 1942), naming it "Fw 190 T" is in line with the preceding [[Bf109 T Kai|Bf 109 T]].
