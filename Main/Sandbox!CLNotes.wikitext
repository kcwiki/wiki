Ships can be evaluated on a few factors:

Marginal improvement: The benefit of a ship over the alternatives (e.g. Abukuma is a humongous improvement over almost any other CL)

Performance Ceiling: The maximum performance of a ship, this is the main determinant of a list for hard mode. (e.g. Choukai is only marginally better than other CA, but with the highest maximum stats is the CA of choice for hard mode)

Niches: Any special roles a ship fills, especially if such a ship would be good even in the absence of that niche

Accessibility: The ease at which a ship can be obtained

For example, Jintsuu is significantly more powerful than Nagara, being superior in almost all areas. However, Jintsuu is a far lower priority than Nagara.

Nagara reaches peak performance at just level 20, while Jintsuu requires level 60 to fulfil her potential. For a relatively new player, being able to save time by training up a relatively capable CL who can still function in a second-line later on is woorth it.

Jintsuu in pure offensive terms has a much higher performance ceiling than Nagara, however, by the time a top-performing ship is required, Abukuma often serves the role of a high-performance CL and serves many niches far better than Jintsuu.


Examples for DDs: Akatsuki K2 is significantly weaker than Murasame K2 in almost all areas, such as firepower, armor, and carrying daihatsus. However, Akatsuki is a far more important ship to prepare because Akatsuki is far more capable and accessible for her role than Murasame is for hers.

Akatsuki is far easier to obtain (requiring only L70) and performs reasonably well for the early-mid game where she is relevant, and serves as a good second line past that.

In contrast, Murasame is far more expensive (L77 + Action Report) and outclassed by others such as Arashio (L67+BP) and Michishio (L77 only), who occupy her niche just as well and are cheaper than her. The additional need for a third daihatsu DD (Murasame) is rarely sufficient to justify her as a high priority.




CL Overall Writeup

Light cruisers (CLs) are often seen as the least required class of all ship types for events. This is because of the combined fleet mechanic, which only allows for one (and only one) CL in the escort fleet.

However, CLs are also the category of ships which possess the greatest power differentials (trophy ships aside). While one can often afford to substitute a CA for a weaker one, such as Choukai for Nachi, the same cannot be said of CLs, with the top tier CLs often possessing unique and features. 

For these reasons, choosing and training the right CLs is one of the most important tasks in preparing a fleet. Second and third tier DDs (e.g. Hatsuharu) frequently see use on less important maps, second and third-tier CLs rarely even see action.

* She has accuracy and firepower bonuses when equipped with certain medium guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority:

* Kai/Kai Ni: '''Low'''
: She is just an average light cruiser at Kai but is incapable of carrying seaplanes. This means she is unable to perform artillery spotting which hampers her combat effectiveness. This does not change upon Kai Ni. Although she gains an AACI, it has a low fixed shootdown and weak multiplier. Her best AACI also requires taking a subpar loadout that interferes with the optimum night battle loadout. She is one of the cheapest light cruisers to run which makes her suited to maximising expedition gains. Beyond that, she doesn't have much use beyond quests.

===Analysis===
Priority:

* Kai/Kai Ni: '''Very Low'''
: Tatsuta is incapable of carrying seaplanes, this prevents her from artillery spotting, greatly hampering her combat effectiveness. This problem is not fixed at K2 as she only gains the ability to carry autogyroes. Furthermore, her AACI has a low fixed shootdown and weak multiplier. She does gain the ability to carry Daihatsu Landing Craft which makes her a good expedition ship. In short, quests aside, she offers almost no utility to the fleet.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Medium''': Despite Tama's impressive-sounding versatility, she is extremely expensive to obtain and in general outclassed by most other cruisers at her price point. Unlike Yura, she misses out on opening torpedoes in exchange for more exotic niches. As CLs have the greatest differences between them in terms of ship capability, this makes Tama a relatively low priority.

* She has accuracy and firepower bonuses when equipped with certain medium guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority:

* Kai: '''Low'''
: She is just an average light cruiser at Kai. Her remodel level is lower than other light cruisers but not by much.

* Kai Ni: '''High'''
: Her Kai Ni lowers her firepower a little bit but comes with a significant increase to her torpedo and armour. She also gains special abilities that make her one of the most important light cruisers in the game. The most important of these is the ability to equip midget submarines so she can perform opening torpedo strikes. For all intents and purposes, she is a torpedo cruiser in disguise, resulting in significantly increased passing rates in events. 

This in itself makes her a candidate for best CL in the game, and a major asset that must be committed carefully. Her ability to equip Daihatsu Landing Craft makes her an asset for maximising expedition gains and for transport maps. Although she can also equip Ka-Mi tanks, her low firepower and her immense utility in other roles often precludes her use there.

* She has accuracy and firepower bonuses when equipped with certain medium guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority:

* Kai: '''Low'''
: She is just an average light cruiser at Kai with no compensating features.

* Kai Ni: '''Medium'''
: Her Kai Ni doesn't do much to improve her combat stats but she does gain a boost to her ASW and survivability. What she does gain is unparalleled versatility which is well worth the high remodel level and blueprint cost. She is certainly a "jack of all trades master of none". Her low overall stats means she loses out to more specialised light cruisers like [[Abukuma]] or [[Tama]] but her multi-role capability means she is still valuable in the long term. Critically, she is only the second CL capable of running opening torpedoes, allowing her to act as a substitute for when Abukuma needs to be saved.

Although she can carry both Daihatsu and Ka-Mi tanks, her low firepower means her effectiveness against installations is limited. It is also a waste of her capabilities. It does mean that she can be used to maximise expedition gains. Her AACI is, like like most other non-specialized AACIs, extremely mediocre. She is also one of the few ships where a Reinforcement Expansion is mandatory.

* She has accuracy and firepower bonuses when equipped with certain medium guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority:

* Kai: '''Low'''
: She is just an average light cruiser at Kai with no compensating features.

* Kai Ni: '''Medium'''
: She has a costly Kai Ni with a high remodel level and requiring a blueprint. For that, she doesn't gain much in the way of combat stats. Her ability to carry both Daihatsu and Ka-Mi tanks don't count for much in the anti-installation role because of her poor firepower. Her best AACI does have an average fixed shootdown and multiplier but she lacks any other benefit to justify bringing her along over a dedicated AACI ship. Her primary asset is that expeditions she is on have an innate 5% resource bonus, as if she was already carrying a daihatsu. This in itself makes her the best expedition leader in the game. As an important thing to note, this "built in" daihatsu does not count for anti-installation purposes.

===Analysis===
Priority:

* Kai/Kai Ni: '''Low'''
: She is just an average light cruiser at Kai with no compensating features. Her Kai Ni doesn't improve her combat stats and actually reduces her combat effectiveness by taking away her ability to perform artillery spotting. She requires the least effort to obtain OASW but that is a minor benefit compared to focusing on more combat oriented light cruisers. Her ASW capability does become more valuable as you progress in the game so you can save your more valuable ASW ships for later event maps. Her AACI has an average fixed shootdown and multiplier. It also requires an inferior equipment loadout so it is best you do not use it.
