==Introduction==
戦闘航海中の海上で燃料弾薬を補給することが可能です。
これを保持した状態で燃料が欠乏すると戦闘航海中に「洋上補給」が発動し、燃料弾薬が洋上で「補給」されます。
長期戦となる艦隊決戦のサポートにご活用ください。
(発動すると消滅します。)

''It's possible to perform resupply on the seas to ships performing combat sailing.''<br>
''When fuel is low while this is being held, "Maritime Resupply" will happen, and fuel & ammo will be replenished on the seas.''<br>
''Please use this well as a support for the final battle, which could become a war of attrition.''<br>
''(Will disappear when activated.)''

==Notes==
*'''Unbuildable'''. Stock equipment of [[Hayasui]] and [[Hayasui|Hayasui Kai]].
*Common reward from various event maps.
*When certain conditions are met, the resupply will activate, restoring '''25%''' of Max Ammo and fuel to each ship in single fleets. 
*It can also restore '''15%''' in combined fleets, which applies to both fleets in a [[Combined Fleet]] situation.
*Will activate regardless of where [[Hayasui]] (and [[Hayasui|Hayasui Kai]]) or [[Kamoi|Kamoi Kai Bo]] is in the fleet.
