===Analysis===
Priority: '''Medium'''
: She is just an average destroyer at Kai that doesn't have anything to set her apart from the rest. She gains a high amount of firepower, torpedo, asw and the ability to equip fleet command facilities and type 2 Ka-Mi tanks at Kai Ni. With her high firepower, she makes a good anti-installation ship. However, she does lose some effectiveness because she is unable to equip Daihatsu. She also requires an Action Report for her remodel which can be costly to newer players.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* ASW
* Anti-installation

===Important Information===
* Required for A67, B61, and B121.
* Comes with a [[Type 22 Surface RADAR Kai 4]]+4 at Kai Ni.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''High'''
: She is just an average destroyer at Kai that doesn't have anything to set her apart from the rest. Her Kai Ni remodel comes with improvements to her firepower and torpedo but she still has lower stats than the top combat destroyers, her main trait is her high luck and relatively low remodel level which makes her a good option for early torpedo cut-in use.
