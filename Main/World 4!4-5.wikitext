===Tips===
*Unlocked by clearing both 4-4 and 5-1
*It takes 5 kills to clear the map. Upon completion you are rewarded '''180 points''' and a '''medal'''. Boss's HP bar resets at midnight at the beginning of each month
**The boss comp will be reverted back to Initial Form post-clear until the next month reset
<br/>
*Regarding the boss, boss is [[Harbor Princess]], an installation-type enemy. Equipping [[Type 3 Shell]]s and [[WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)]] will deal extra damage to her.
**'''<span style="color:red">Warning: [[Harbor Princess]] becomes substantially stronger on final form!</span>''' The changes are, namely:
***HP increases from '''380''' to '''490'''.
***Base firepower increases from '''100''' to '''180'''.
***Armor increases from '''135''' to '''183''' (Counting equipment)
***This pushes her armor roll values from 128 to 236 (i.e. 183 (±30%)), above the daytime cap of 181. Barring low armor rolls, only critical hits will significantly damage her during the day.
***Base AA increases from '''150''' to '''170'''.
***She gains a completely different set of equipment: Two 15-inch Fortress Cannons, AP Shell, and what is suspected to be [[List_of_equipment_used_by_the_enemy|Abyssal Avenger Torpedo Bomber]]. As a side effect of her equipment, '''her range is increased to long'''.
***The changes allow her to hit harder and earlier during daytime. Since she's an installation-type abyssal ship, she uses the carrier damage calculation formula (even though it is displayed as shelling). Thus, her shelling damage, not counting her equipment or the bonus from AP shell, is already over the day battle cap even with <span style="color:red">Red T</span> engagement. She also gains double attack ability during night battle.
***On the final form, her escort ships also become tougher (Elite/Flagship Transports and Elite CA Ne-class replaces the DD Late Model).

'''Recommended Fleet'''
*<u>'''Standard Routing D-H-K-T : 3 CA(V) 3 CV(B) / 1 BB(V) 3 CA(V) 2 CV(B) / 2 BB 1 CVB 2 CA 1 CAV / 1 BB 2 CV(B) 1 CVL 2 CA(V)'''</u>
**Please beware that Node K has a chance to Heavily Damage your ships due to the presence of 1 or 2 Battleship Ru-Class Kai Flagship
**LoS required for the boss is '''71 Formula 33 Cn=2'''
<br/>
*<u>'''Fast+ Fleet Routing D-H-T : 3 CA(V) 3 CV(B) / 1 BB(V) 2 CA(V) 3 CV(B) (All Fast+)'''</u>
**All Ships are highly recommended to have been applied with Reinforcement Expansion and be equipped with Boiler and Turbine to reach '''Fast+''' speed
***Slow Ships must have 2x Boilers to become "Fast+", so unless you are using slow BBs who have 5 Equipment Slots, you are recommended to use FBBs.
**It will only go through the Submarine Node D and a Light Enemy Fleet in node H before going straight into the Boss Node, thus avoid going into node K completely, which contains a Heavy Enemy Fleet.
**The exchange is that your BB(V)/CA(V) won't be able to do Artillery Spotting due to being unable to equip seaplane, though as they will still be outfitted with 2 Main Guns, they will still be able to do Double Attack during Night Battle.
**It is highly recommended that the CV(B)s are all outfitted with Aircraft Cut-In setup to be able to deal with non-Installation Escort Ships quickly and efficiently
<br/>
*<u>'''CL and DD Routing'''</u>
**Like '''Fast+''' routing, you will also skip node K which contains dangerous enemies but it can be difficult to defeat [[Harbour Princess]] at boss, especially in her Final Form.
**Four-slot DD such as [[Tashkent]], or four-slot CL like [[Ooyodo]] are useful in this situation as they can carry two WG42 to deal significant damage to [[Harbour Princess]].
**Can be helpful should you do the quests that require you to take CL/DDs into 4-5 Boss or attempt to save cost from supplying and repairing ships.
***'''2 [(F)BB(V)+CV(L/B)] 1 CL 3 DD (Routes A-D-H-T or C-D-H-T)'''
***'''1 FBB 2 CVL 1 CL 2 DD (All Fast / Routes C-F-I-J-H-T or A-B-E-M-N-T)'''
