===Tips===
<br/>'''Recommended Fleet'''
*'''1 AV, 2 CVL, 2 DE, 1 CL''' routes '''C-E-F-H-K'''
**Takes a fixed route with 1 surface battle and a bauxite node '''F''' before routing directly to the boss. 
**Taking a CL that can carry '''{{Equipment/Link|Daihatsu Landing Craft|Toku Daihatsu Landing Craft|text=Daihatsu}}''' will allow you to maximize on resource pickup.
*'''1 AV, 2 DD, 3 XX (XX being any CLT, CA(V), CL or AV)''' routes '''C-E-K or C-E-F-H-K'''
**Avoid Node G, which contains Ru-class BBs
**Be sure your Seaplane Tenders and Aviation Cruisers (if used) bring enough {{Equipment/Link|Zuiun|text=Zuiuns}} or {{Equipment/Link|Type 2 Seaplane Fighter Kai|text=Seaplane Fighters}} to help overpower the boss composition's air power as there will be a {{Enemy/Link|Standard Carrier Wo-Class Elite|text=Wo-class Elite}} or {{Enemy/Link|Light Carrier Nu-Class Elite|text=Nu-class Elite}} present at the boss node in all compositions
**Path '''C-E-K''' is guaranteed if your fleet contains any CL, with the fleet being '''Fast'''.
<br/>'''Transport Kills'''
*This map is ideal for farming transport kills for [[Quests#Bw3|Bw3]] and [[Quests#Bw4|Bw4]], as node B contains 2 transports per run and can be reached consistently with the fleet '''3 CVL, 3 XX''' going '''C - B - A'''
**Having '''3 or more carriers''' in your fleet will '''always''' route you to B allowing you to fight 2 transports and score bauxite every run. With the right carriers and/or equipment, it is possible to break even on bauxite consumption (or even make a net gain) while farming the transports.
