==Introduction==
「長10cm砲」といわれる10cm連装高角砲と「94式高射装置」の組み合わせによる、艦隊防空システムです。<br>量産性が低く、また射撃装置は列強の最新鋭には劣りますが、<br>優秀な長10cm砲と高射装置の組み合わせは艦隊の傘として十分に活躍します。 

"A fleet air defence system created by combining the 10cm twin high-angle gun (Long 10cm Gun) and the Type 94 Anti-Air Fire Director. <br>It was unable to be mass produced and the fire director was inferior to the state-of-the-art ones used by the great powers,<br> but the combination of the Long 10cm Gun and the fire director was still able to function as an air defence umbrella for the fleet.

==Notes==
