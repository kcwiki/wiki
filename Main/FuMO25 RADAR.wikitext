かの国で開発された艦載用レーダー(電探)です。<br>科学の国の電子兵装、残念ながら、我が連合艦隊に装備された電探よりスペックは高いです。<br>主に巡洋艦以上の大型艦艇に搭載されました。 

''The FuMO25 radar is a ship-borne radar developed from another country. Developed from a country with expertise in military technology, it's unfortunate that our Combined Fleet radar is inferior compared to this radar. It is mainly used aboard cruisers or any other larger warships.''

FuMO stands for Funkmess-Ortung in German, and is a radar classification.

German radar used on capital ships. However, records state that Prinz Eugen carried the FuMO 81 ''Berlin-S ''Radar instead of the FuMO 25. Spec wise, the FuMO 81 was far superior, as it had a 50% wider range. It also had a higher frequency of 3300 MHz compared to the 368MHz the FuMO 25 used.
