==Introduction==
当時の世界水準を遥かに上回る艦上攻撃機傑作機。<br>
優れた航続距離を誇り、速度や防弾装備は劣るものの、初期の機動部隊艦載機の主力攻撃機として大活躍しました。<br>
「九七艦攻」と呼ばれ、雷撃・水雷爆撃をこなす主力艦上攻撃機ですが、徐々に現役を退いていきます。

''This aircraft is capable of long range cruising in the early days of the war. Despite being unarmored and slow, it had a great operational range, and at the early days of hostilities was the main attack aircraft of the Carrier Task Force. Called the Type 97 Attack Aircraft, it was mainly used for torpedo bombing of enemy ships, but was gradually phased out of that role.''
