[[File:Repair Team and-or Goddes on flagship.png|thumb|87x87px|You can select which Repair Team or Goddess to be consumed to advance.]]
'''Unbuildable.''' Event reward for clearing the following maps: [[May 2013 Event]] E-1, [[August 2013 Event]] E-2, [[Fall 2013 Event]] E-3, [[Spring 2014 Event]] E-4 and [[Fall 2014 Event]] E-3.<br>

When a ship that is equipped with Repair Goddess is sunk, the ship will be brought back to life with '''full HP'''. Ammo/Fuel bars '''are replenished fully'''.<br>

The Repair Goddess will '''ONLY''' repair the ship it is equipped on. It will '''NOT''' repair other ships which do not have their own Repair Team/Goddess equipped, even if they are in the same fleet. 

Also if this is equipped to a flagship, the player can use this before heading to another node, restoring the flagship back to full health as well as gaining the same benefits as said above. <br> 

This item is consumed upon activation.
