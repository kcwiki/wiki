'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''
* She has accuracy bonuses and penalties when equipped with certain large guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''High'''

: She has very high firepower for a fast battleship and her high defensive stats make her even better. Her drawbacks are that she is an event-only drop and she is very costly to run. If you do have her, and resources are not an issue, she is a top pick for a fast battleship.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Support Expeditions

==Drop Locations==
Currently limited to event-only.

==Trivia==
*She is named after the state of [[wikipedia:Iowa|Iowa]].
*She is the first American-based Kanmusu to be introduced into the KanColle franchise. 
*She debuted in KanColle Kai before making her way over to the browser game in the [[Spring_2016_Event|Spring 2016 Event]].
*She's also the first Kanmusu in which her ship she is based upon is both a survivor from WWII and still exists to this present day.
* In her browser release, Iowa had a bug that caused her stats to increase higher than originally intended, this bug was however fixed on May 13th, 2016.
*She speaks [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonin_English Bonin English].
*Based on Takana and Yoshinori's interview in the June 2016 Edition of Comtiq Magazine, they explained a few important key points regarding Iowa and her design.
** Yoshinori noted that Iowa's design concept started back a year and a half ago from the Spring 2016 Event. It involved a large amount of research at designs from WWII to come up with a design that would represent Iowa and making her appear American on first glance.
** Takana and Yoshinori noted that the main inspiration for Iowa design came from Airplane Nose Pin art. An example of such would be the art from the B-17 Bomber "Memphis Belle".
*Struck on March 17, 2006
*Became the last lead ship of all battleships in the US Navy during WWII.
*Recommissioned twice before she was finally struck and re-purposed as a Museum ship in Los Angeles
