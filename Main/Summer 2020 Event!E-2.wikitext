Branching compositions were reported over the course of the event.

|tips = <br> '''Disclaimer: The following guide is a preliminary release for this event map, it contains information from early tests, do note that some things are subject to change as more information is gathered over the event and thus the guide is subject to change.'''

'''Preparation'''

'''The event is likely to have several shiplocks (E-1 to E-4 already contain 4 separate locks), please plan your locks carefully.'''

For this operation, you will be organizing a combined fleet to fight against an installation with very high HP, along with achieving high air power and then facing off against a carrier fleet in the finale. As such you will make sure not only your ships are up to part for locking purposes, but to also make sure your equipment is capable enough to help take care of the installation.

The following things could be considered for this map:

# Do you have anti-installation equipment?
# Do you have enough anti-installation ships and equipment to construct at least 1-2 Anti-installation nukes?
# Do you have a majority of the carriers including weaker ones like the Unryuu-class and/or Aquila?


Below is a list of all the historical ships that have relevance to the Kure Naval District and Operation Ten-Go (in which this map takes place within.)

'''Ship Bonuses (Tentative)'''

{{:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/E-2/historical_ships}}

'''Ships marked with * have bonuses in other maps.''' [[Yahagi]], [[Sakawa]], [[Suzutsuki]], [[Hatsushimo]] and [[Verniy]] is  a safe choice to lock here. 

[[Yamato]] and [[Kitakami]] are also recommended, but are subject to debate due to use and practicality. Carefully decided if you wish to include them. 

The rest should not be used on this map.

'''Phase 1: Set New High Scores (Kill Supply Depot Hime)'''

In this phase you will mainly be using a fleet that will have to go through fights with submarines, some surface ships, air attacks and possibly some battleships depending on the route you take before you reach the boss node. You will need to prepare accordingly to handle each node depending on the route you take.

Depending on the difficulty, the [[Supply Depot Princess]] will be buffed considerably having up to '''2400 HP''' on Hard mode. While her HP has been buffed considerably and she now has an opening torp, her core weakness remains the same. She is escorted by a CVL and some light surface units.

Below is a list consisting of several possible methods that can be considered:

<tabber>
|-|TCF Method=
* Route: A-C-H-I-M
* '''Composition: TCF: 1AV 1CAV 4DD + 1CL 1-2CA(V) 3-4DD'''
* '''LBAS: 1 Base, 5 Range to boss. (Both to boss node)'''
** '''LBAS Recommendation: 1 Fighter, 3 Bombers or 4 Bombers'''
* Node C is a submarine node and H being a light surface engagement.
* Will completely above traveling to Node J.
* Speed is not a concern with this composition.
* Air Parity on Hard LD is around 125('''TBC, rough value''') Fighter Power.
* As the SDH's core weakness remains unchanged, any Ship with a [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tanks & Marines)|DLC (T89)]] + [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank|KaMi Tank]] + [[WG42]]/[[Shipborne Model Type 4 20cm Anti-ground Rocket Launcher|T4 Mortar]] (or concentrated variant) is capable of taking her out in a single shot if it hits. Therefore it is highly recommended to set up at least one of your ships in a way that is capable of doing so.
* Falling short of that, T3 shells and night-time Tank/KaMi Double attacks can help.

|-|STF CV Comp=
* '''Route: A-B-E-H-I-K-J-M'''
* '''Composition: STF: 1FBB 1 CV 2-3 CA(V) 0-1 AV 1-2 CL + 1CL 0-1 CA(V) 3-4DD 0-1 SS(V)''' (All Fast)
* '''LBAS: 1 Base, 5 Range to boss. (Both to boss node)'''
** '''LBAS Recommendation: 1 Fighter, 3 Bombers or 4 Bombers'''
* Node E is an air attack node and H being a light surface engagement, J is a surface battle against 2 battleships and escorts.
* ASW will not be needed along this route.
** An AACI ship along with some decent airpower is helpful along this route.
* A submarine in your fleet is optional, but effective for helping you with distract the enemy light carrier can appear in the boss composition.
* If you bring any slow ships, you will need to speed mod them to fast.
* Air Parity on Hard LD is around 125('''TBC, rough value''') Fighter Power.
* As the SDH's core weakness remains unchanged, any Ship with a [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tanks & Marines)|DLC (T89)]] + [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank|KaMi Tank]] + [[WG42]]/[[Shipborne Model Type 4 20cm Anti-ground Rocket Launcher|T4 Mortar]] (or concentrated variant) is capable of taking her out in a single shot if it hits. Therefore it is highly recommended to set up at least one of your ships in a way that is capable of doing so.
* Falling short of that, T3 shells and night-time Tank/KaMi Double attacks can help.

|-|STF CVL Comp=
* Route: A-C-H-I-K-J-M
* '''Composition: STF: 1FBB 1 CVL 2-3 CA(V) 0-1 AV 1-2 CL + 1CL 0-1 CA(V) 3-4DD '''
* '''LBAS: 1 Base, 5 Range to boss. (Both to boss node)'''
** '''LBAS Recommendation: 1 Fighter, 3 Bombers or 4 Bombers'''
* Node C is a submarine node and H being a light surface engagement, J is a surface battle against 2 battleships and escorts.
* Will not have to worry about air attacks.
* Speed is not a concern with this composition.
* Air Parity on Hard LD is around 125('''TBC, rough value''') Fighter Power.
* As the SDH's core weakness remains unchanged, any Ship with a [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tanks & Marines)|DLC (T89)]] + [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank|KaMi Tank]] + [[WG42]]/[[Shipborne Model Type 4 20cm Anti-ground Rocket Launcher|T4 Mortar]] (or concentrated variant) is capable of taking her out in a single shot if it hits.

With the combination of your LBAS, and a well put together fleet, it should be possible to clear the [[Supply Depot Princess]] easily even on last dance. As long as you have the Anti-installation nuke and have a means to wipe out the other units this of the battle should be cleared easily.

Once the supply depot princess has been defeated, the second boss gauge will appear and you will need to unlock the path to reach it.

'''Phase 2: Unlock the Second Boss:'''

The requirements needed will be to simply gain access to the boss (on Hard+) will require you to reach two air nodes (Node E and G) and get AS from them.

Medium and lower is suspected to only need Node E for completion.

* AS (for Hard) on Nodes E and G. Medium (and lower?) only requires AS on Node E. For this (54/198/293/359) Fighter Power is required on C/E/M/H.
* '''Composition: CTF: 2CV 0-1CV(L)1 0-1 AV 1-3 CA(V) 0-1CL/DD + 1CL 2DD 3XX'''
* '''LBAS: On Rest or 4 Fighter Sweeps to E/G''' if falling short of Fighter Power requirements
* '''Routes: A-B-E, A-B-D-G''', with E/G being Airstrike Nodes and D being a submarine node
* Load your CV(L), CAV, and/or AV full of fighters/SPF and give the escort fleet OASW/AACI

Once the conditions of Nodes E and G are met, the path will unlock.

'''Phase 3: Defeat the enemy Carrier Task Force:'''

In this phase, you are required to kill the enemy Wo-Class Kai 7 Times on Hard to clear the map. She herself is not particularly threatening, but is escorted by a BB Water Demon capable of soaking a lot of Damage as well as a CVL and some other light surface units.

CTF is the most preferred method to taking care of this segment . The path along the way will mainly have light ended ships but towards the end you'll face off against an enemy CVL unit before reaching the boss.

However, if you can also reuse the STF if used in previous phases, which goes through an additional surface battle node (R) that contains 2 enemy battleships (and possibly a CVL depending on comp).

* Setting up your CV for AS will require you to make your CV a fighter mule along with a CA(V) carrying some seaplane fighters and going for AP (~133 Fighter Power with losses accounted for) or AS (~299 Fighter Power with losses accounted for) should be sufficient for the main fleet.
* It is not worth setting up the fleet to be able to sink the BB Water Demon for clearing; it is better to increase the pass rate by taking OASW, AACI and DA on the escort fleet instead.

As noted above, the boss is not difficult; the flagship is a Wo-class carrier Flagship Kai. All you will need is a well placed double attack / CVCI to defeat her. The rest of the enemies will fall easily (save [[Battleship Water Demon Kai]]) so unless you have intent to farm this node for drops, clearing the map should be viable with minimal effort. Once you deplete the HP gauge and sink the flagship carrier, the map is considered complete.
