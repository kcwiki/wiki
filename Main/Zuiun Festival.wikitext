* [[Murasame]] is her favorite Shiratsuyu-class member , so she was kinda bummed about how she didn't get to appear in the Zuiun Festival

'''[[Motoko Kobayashi]]''':
* Kobayashi asked the audiece, "What day is it?". The Audience respond with a mixture of "Zuiun Day! Nenohi!". Kobayashi then respoded "Well this is getting chaotic..."  [[Saki Fujita]] then replied, "So which one did you like better?" Kobayshi would then respond with "Eh, both, I guess".

* all in all she has been teased a lot by  [[Saki Fujita]] (they even call her "Shū-chan")

'''[[Ayaka Imamura]]''':
