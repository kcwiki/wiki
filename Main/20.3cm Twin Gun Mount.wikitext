|notes = They can also be equipped on light cruisers, as there technically isn't a naval treaty in the Kancolle universe. However in the interview with Japanese Febri magazine the line appeared as "20.3cm guns equipped on light cruisers will not be able to show 100% efficiency", although there is no data to prove the fact.}}

==Introduction==
重巡に搭載された主砲、それが20.3cm連装砲です。<br />
条約上限一杯の8インチ（20.3cm）のこの砲は、中距離での砲撃戦はもちろん、
夜戦のような近距離での殴り合いでも十分にその威力を発揮します。<br />
限定的ですが、対空射撃も可能です。

''The 20.3cm twin gun was the main armament of heavy cruisers.<br> With a calibre at the maximum allowed by the Treaty of 8 inches (20.3cm), it has sufficient power for medium-range combat and close-range night battle brawls.<br> It also has limited anti-air capabilities.''

Equipped as standard main guns for all Japanese heavy cruisers. Initially it was developed as the 20.0cm single mount (as seen on early Furutaka-class cruisers) but was later modified to fit 8.0 inches (20.3cm). "''
