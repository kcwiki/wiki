==Introduction==

新型水上戦闘機の実戦投入までの繋ぎとして、零式艦上戦闘機をベースに急遽開発/実戦投入された水上戦闘機です。<br>
カタパルトによる艦上運用を考慮した機材ではありませんでしたが、本機は機体及びフロート強度を改良強化して投入です。

A new model of seaplane fighter thrown into combat in order add numbers to the fight, the base form of the Type 0 Zero Carrier Fighter has been hurriedly converted to a seaplane and put in service.
 
No extra equipment was added to the plane, instead the airframe and float devices have been strengthened to handle catapult assisted take-off.
==Notes==
* Can be obtained via upgrading '''[[Type 0 Recon Seaplane]]'''.
* '''Cannot be used to activate [[Artillery Spotting|daytime special attacks]]''' by itself as it no longer has recon function.
