==Introduction==
呉海軍工廠砲熕部で試作された純国産戦艦主砲の三連装砲、<br>
その改修改良型です。if兵装ではありますが、各部及び射撃装置を熟成改良し、砲弾誘爆防止措置も考慮した同砲を装備した改長門型戦艦は、当時世界列強の「ビッグ７」水準を遥かに凌駕した攻防のバランスと高い砲撃精度を実現します。

This is an improved version of the domestically made battleship main gun mount prototype that was designed by the artillery department of the Kure Naval Arsenal.<br>
The gun was refined in multiple areas, including improvements to the fire control system and countermeasures against shell explosions. Even though this is a "what-if" equipment, the Kai Nagato-class battleship with this gun mount surpasses the "Big 7" standard of great power at the time tremendously, achieving an excellent balance of offensive and defensive prowess as well as high shelling accuracy.
