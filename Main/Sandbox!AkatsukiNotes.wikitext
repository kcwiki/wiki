===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''
: She is just an average destroyer at Kai that doesn't have anything to set her apart from the rest. She gains significant increases to her firepower and torpedo stats that make her a good combat destroyer. However, she loses out to the other good combat destroyers in terms of power. Her high remodel level doesn't help her case either. 

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat

====Not Recommended Roles====
* ASW

===Important Information===
* Required for A10, A52, A53, B12, B42, B44, and B45.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''High'''
: She is just an average destroyer at Kai that doesn't have anything to set her apart from the rest. She gains a decent increase to her firepower and a significant increase to her torpedo, ASW, HP and armour stats at Kai Ni. This makes her an all round decent combat destroyer and a great ASW destroyer. In addition to this, she can carry Daihatsu and Ka-Mi tanks. This gives her great anti-installation capability. It also makes her good for expeditions. It also makes her a good choice for transport maps when taking into account her toughness.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* ASW
* Expeditions
* Anti-installation

===Important Information===
* Required for A10, A53, A54, A55, B12, B42, B45, B46 and B47.
