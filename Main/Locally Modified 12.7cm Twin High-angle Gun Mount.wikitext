==Introduction==
比較的簡易な構造で経済性も高く、実用的な対空高角砲として量産された両用砲。海を渡った奇跡の駆逐艦、その再武装時に前部主砲として装備運用されました。日本海軍の残した防衛兵装を、接収艦再武装時に現地で艦載用に改装した独自兵装です。

A relatively simple and cheap dual purpose gun that was mass-produced as a practical anti-air gun. The miraculous destroyer that crossed the seas had this equipped as her forward gun when she was refitted. This unique gun was locally modified for ship-borne use from defensive weapons left behind by the Imperial Japanese Navy and mounted on reparation ships during refitting.
