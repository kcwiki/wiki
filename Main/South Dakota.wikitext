==Trivia==

* She is named after the state of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota South Dakota].
* Her reputation as a jinx is possibly due to all of the following incidents:
** Her career started with an engine breakdown in August 1942, but repairs were completed the next morning.
** Following that, she struck an uncharted reef near Tonga in September 1942. Repairs and refits at Pearl Harbor took until October to be completed.
** At the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Santa_Cruz_Islands Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands], the only bomb that manage to strike her was a non-penetrating hit that still managed to take out her number 2 turret.
** She collided with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Mahan_(DD-364) Mahan] while returning to port after Santa Cruz.
** During the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Naval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal#Second_Naval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal,_14%E2%80%9315_November Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal], a problem with her electrical system in the middle of the night knocked out her RADAR and blinded her.
** In the same battle, she engaged enemies with her rear turrets and set her [[OS2U]]s on fire. The second salvo knocked 2 of the 3 burning planes overboard and put out the fire on the third.
** Her electrical systems were restored, but the shock from the subsequent salvo knocked out all her electrics again.
** In October 1944, she collided with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Aldebaran Aldebaran].
** In November 1944, anti-air fire from other ships in her task force killed some of her crew.
** In April 1945, some propellant exploded in her turret while resupplying from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Wrangell_(AE-12) Wrangell]. Her crew was forced to flood her turret to prevent a detonation.
