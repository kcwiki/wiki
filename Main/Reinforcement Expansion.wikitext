=Introduction=

Reinforcement Expansions (RE) are an item that was introduced during the [[Summer 2015 Event]]. They can be obtained from quests, events or the item shop. It is used to give ship girls an extra equipment slot that can equip certain auxiliary equipment.

''This item is very valuable and careful consideration should be given towards who to use it on. Please refer to [[Help:Reinforcement Expansion|the help page]] for advice.''

=Using Reinforcement Expansions= 

The following conditions must be fulfilled before a RE can be used:

# The ship girl in question needs to be at least '''level 30'''.
# There must be a Reinforcement Expansion in your inventory.

Not meeting either of these conditions will make you unable to even bring up the RE menu. Once both conditions have been met, follow the following steps:

# Proceed to the [[Remodel (Menu)|Remodel]] menu and select the girl you wish to use the RE on.
# Mouse over the right side of her card and a notification saying '''"Add Extra Equipment Slots (補強装備を増設改修する)''' will appear.
# Click on her card and a menu will appear asking you to confirm RE use.
# Click on the '''Add Reinforcement Expansion (増設改修する)''' button to confirm.
# An extra equipment slot will then be added to your ship girl.

=Uses=

Reinforcement Expansions are important because they allow your ship girls to carry utility equipment that would otherwise compromise their combat effectiveness. The chart below details what equipment can be equipped in the RE of a ship girl. Please refer to individual ship girl pages, individual equipment pages or [[Help:Reinforcement Expansion|the help page]] for more details.
