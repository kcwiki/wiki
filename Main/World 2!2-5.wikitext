===Tips===
*You are required to '''sink''' the flagship at boss node 4 times to clear the map. The reward for clearing the map is '''100 points''' and a '''medal.''' Boss's HP Bar will reset at midnight at the beginning of each month.
*This map requires your fleet to have a certain amount of Line of Sight (LoS) in order to route to the boss. It uses [[Line_of_Sight#Formula%2033|Formula 33 (F33)]] to calculate the LoS of your fleet to determine if you meet the LoS check.
** Fleets routing from '''I-O requires Cn1 = 34'''
** Fleets routing from '''J-O require Cn1 = 49'''
*[[Akashi]] can drop with a small chance in 2-5, but only for Admirals who have do not have her yet in their base. If you already have her, she will not drop in this map anymore.

<br/>'''Recommended Fleet'''
*There are 3 routes you can go
**The middle route is the preferred route used for clearing since it allows for 1 CV and 1 CVL to be brought, enabling powerful opening air strikes.
**The top north route should be considered for clearing quests such as [[Quests#Bm1|Bm1]], it can also be used for clearing despite the high cost
**The north-middle route should only be used for clearing quests that banned heavy ships and only allow up to 1 CA(V) such as [[Quests#Bm7|Bm7]]

<br/><u>'''Middle route C-E-I-O: 1 CV 1 CVL 1 CL 3 DD / 2 CVL 1 CL 3 DD (All Fast)'''</u>
* Attention should be given to fleet ordering to ensure you maximize for day battle performance. 
* Use CV(L) that are able to perform strong opening air strikes.
* Ensure that the fleet speed is '''fast'''.
* Ensure that you meet the required LoS to route to the boss node ('''>= 34 Cn1''')
*Carriers should be equipped to utilize '''CVCI''' to maximize accuracy and shelling power against the enemies at the boss node. 

<br/><u>'''Top north route B-F-J-O: 1 BBV 2 CAV 3 CA (each CAV carrying 1 drum canisters)'''</u>
*All enemy compositions before the boss do not have any air power making it easy to secure Air Supremacy (AS+) with a minimal of 1 Seaplane Bomber (SPB) on a CAV or BBV. 
*'''[[Artillery_Spotting|Artillery spotting]]''' should be used to increase the likelihood of reaching the boss node.
*Ensure that you meet the required LoS to route to the boss node ('''>= 49 Cn1''')
*This composition is recommended to be used when attempting to clear the monthly quest [[Quests#Bm1|Bm1]].
*The boss formation is random between 3 Ru class battleships or 2 Ru class battleships and 1 Wo class carrier. You are required to bring more seaplane bombers if you wish to secure AS at boss as well

<br/><u>'''North-middle route B-F-E-I-O: 1 CA 1 CL 4 DD - Fast Fleet'''</u>
*This composition is recommended to be used when attempting to clear the monthly quest [[Quests#Bm7|Bm7]].
*Ensure that you meet the required LoS to route to the boss node ('''>= 34 Cn1''')
*This route is difficult without access to ships that are able to equip seaplane bomber or seaplane fighter to gain some air power
**'''[[Zara|Zara Due]]''' is the ideal choice due to her large first slot ensuring that the seaplane bomber can survive until the boss node and potentially securing AS+ against the triple Ru-class battleship formation. You may also wish to include a seaplane fighter (along with the seaplane bomber) to ensure that you are able to secure AS in the event that you face the boss formation that contains a Wo class carrier.
**Otherwise any single '''Zara or Agano class''' with a seaplane bomber will be sufficient to secure [[Artillery Spotting]] for the pre-boss nodes.
*Please note that as your fleet for this route is pretty light, there is a good chance you will get heavily damaged before reaching the boss node. Sparkling is recommended for boss node reaching consistency
