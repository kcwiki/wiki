==Introduction==
夕雲型駆逐艦などに搭載された駆逐艦主砲のif改修型です。<br>
最大仰角を大きく設定しましたが、装填システムの基本構造は従来通りのため対空能力は限定的です。<br>ただし、数々の実戦の戦訓を取り入れた改修により、甲型及び丙型駆逐艦での運用において、優れた砲戦能力を発揮します。

A what-if upgrade of the destroyer main gun that was mounted on the Yuugumo-class destroyers.<br>
It has a much higher maximum elevation but because the loading system is more or less the same, it's anti-air capabilities are limited.<br>However, thanks to the improvements made by incorporating lessons learned in live combat, it will display excellent shelling power when equipped on Type-A and Type-C destroyers.
