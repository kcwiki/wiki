===Tips===
*'''Requires destroying the [[Aircraft Carrier Princess]] 6 times to clear.'''
*This map features multiple starting zone positions. The south route has nodes without enemy CVs and a night battle node, while north route is filled with enemy carriers
*Clearing this map rewards 1 Medal and 250 ranking points. The boss HP bar is reset at the beginning of each month.
*Air raids will appear once you get the second kill on the boss. However, these will stop after you deplete the bar.
*The enemy composition of the map will get harder after you get 3 kills (1 elite ship) and when you reach the final kill (all elite ships)
**The map reverts to all possible pre-final compositions after clearing until the next month reset.
*Do prepare a lot of fuel and bauxite for this map as it'll be a costly monthly EO.
Regarding the boss fleet, it is the first normal map that introduces [[Enemy Combined Fleet]]
*Having access to both of your [[LBAS]] for this map is highly recommended for the sake of being able to complete this map with relative easy. 
**[[LBAS]] setup should be 2 fighters and 2 Land Based Land Attack Bombers.
**[[LBAS]] should be set to target the boss node.
**If fortunate enough, it can be possible to take out the [[Aircraft Carrier Princess]] with the [[LBAS]] or take out a majority of her planes allowing for a chance to easily wipe out all of her bombers rendering her defenseless.
**You are required to have '''5 Range''' to reach the boss with LBAS planes
*Eliminating the entire Escort fleet at the boss node is the key so that you can have a high chance of getting a torpedo salvo on the main fleet. 
*If you are able to take out the enemy fleet's escort flagship along with any of the three enemy escorts, the escort fleet should be removed in night battle, leaving only the main fleet.
**Conditions to engage a night battle against enemy main fleet are not fully known yet, as there are some circumstances that enemy escort flagship is alive, but you still get to fight the enemy main fleet at night.

<br/>'''Recommended Fleet'''
====North Route====
*'''1 BB 1 CA(V) 2 CV(B) 1 DD 1 CLT''' routes '''ACDGM'''
**Node G is an Air Defense node.
**This comp gives the lowest remaining ammo modifier (36% fuel and 32% ammo) when you arrive at the boss, also consumes a lot of bauxite due to the presence of CL Tsu-Class on the way. Only use this comp if you can't use any of the other comps below.
**It is recommended to bring at least 1 ship with Anti-Air Cut-in setup to defend against the enemy Carriers (Akizuki, Maya Kai Ni, Fletcher, ...)
**The BB can be swapped for a 3rd CV(B). The 2nd CV(B) can be swapped for a 2nd BB. 
**The CA(V) can be swapped for a CL or DD. If so, Abukuma Kai Ni or Yuubari Kai Ni Toku is recommended.

====South Route====
*'''2 BB(V) 1 CA(V) 1 CL 2 DD''' routes '''BFIJM'''
**Node B is a Submarine node.
**Node J is a Night Battle node.
**You will arrive at the boss node with 42% fuel and 50% ammo left, there will be no damage penalty for your ships.
**It's highly recommended to bring at least one AACI ship such as Akizuki, Maya Kai Ni, Fletcher, ...
**Using the 5-slot BBVs Ise Kai Ni, CAV and seaplane fighter-carrying battleships such as Musashi Kai Ni, along with LBAS can enable Air Superiority or Air Supremacy to be achieved at the boss.
***With all 4 LBAS waves of Air Parity sent to boss, your fleet needs average '''275+ air''' ('''300+''' for safety) to ensure AS at boss.
****'''140+''' air is enough if you only want AP at the boss node while still ensuring AS+ preboss
**The enemies in this route are lighter and easier to break through except for the boss, will require good ships and equip to score a kill reliably
**The CA(V) can be swapped for a 2nd CL

====South-North Route====
*'''3 BB(V) 1 CA(V)/CL 1 CL 1 DD''' routes '''BCDGM'''
**Node G is an Air Defense node.
**This comp currently gives the best remaining fuel and ammo modifier when you arrive at the boss (48% fuel and 52% ammo)
**However, a lot of good ships are required to make this comp work reliably such as Ise Kai Ni, Hyuuga Kai Ni and good AACI ships like Atlanta, Fletcher, Akizuki class
**Touch attack can be used on node C to increase the passing rate.

====Middle Route====
*'''1 (F)BB(V) 1 CV(L/B) 2 (F)BB(V)/CV(L/B) 1 CL 1 DD''' routes '''ACEHGM'''
**Node G and H are Air Defense node.
**Arriving at the boss node with a slight ammo penalty (44% fuel 44% ammo), this comp is currently the strongest variant you can bring to the boss node with 4 heavy ships in total. It is also an option for any 6-5 related quests with CV(L) such as '''B154''' (Kaga Kai Ni quest).
**However, a full base of [[Prototype Toukai]] is required to increase the passing rate at node E due to the appearance of [[Submarine So-Class]] Elite and Flagship there. Like the South-North comp, a lot of good ships are also required to make this comp work reliably such as 5-slot BB(V), good AACI ships like [[Atlanta]], [[Fletcher]], [[Akizuki]] class.
**Touch attack can be used on node C to increase the passing rate.
