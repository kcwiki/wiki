===Preparation===

In this operation, many of the ships that will be used for E-6 and E-7 are linked between these two maps. You will need to carefully plan who you will be using for this map and make sure not to burn all of them as they could cost you the Hard mode run if this is what you intend to do.

Below is a list consisting of the following that must be considered for this map.

# Do you have Hiei and Kirishima in Kai Ni or Kai Ni C form?
# Do you have enough anti-installation equipment to make at least 3 Anti-installation nukes and some double Anti-Ground Rocket Users?
# Do you have enough Rocket Interceptors / Interceptors that can help you gain AS in air defense of your land base?
# Do you have a ship that can OASW?
# Do you have ASW planes for your land base such as Toukai?
# Do you have at least 3 TCI ships?
# Do you have [[Nelson]] or [[Colorado]]?
# If no to the above question, do you have [[Nagato|Nagato Kai Ni]] or [[Mutsu|Mutsu Kai Ni]]

If you said to all of the above, you are more than ready to take this map on hard. However please review the historical list below before jumping in.

If you said no to anything beside question 7 or 8, you may need to weigh your options. Especially if you lack good anti-installation gear.

If you said no to 7 but yes to 8. You can consider bringing said ship in this map to use her special attack. But be warned that you need to know who you will sacrifice here as to keep the other. As it could affect your overall success rate.

If you're lacking in several of the things on the list, consider dropping difficulty or begin making extensive preparations.

Below is a list of the ships which are historically tied to the battle of Iron Bottom Sound, review the list carefully as certain ships can be effective on certain nodes.

{{:Summer_2020_Event/E-6/historical_ships}}

From those on the list: The most recommended ships to consider for E-6 are [[Kirishima]], [[Hiei]], [[Choukai]], [[Maya]], [[Kinugasa]], [[Mikuma]], [[Atago]], [[Takao]],[[Tenryuu]], [[Michishio]], [[Asashio]], [[Fletcher]], [[Teruzuki]],  [[Shigure]], [[Murasame]], [[Ayanami]], and [[Yuudachi]].

[[Kongou]] and [[Haruna]] can be used as an alternative, however it's recommended to use [[Hiei]] and [[Kirishima]] here due to their stronger bonus. Also you specifically one group or the other. If you have one of them at Kai Ni C, you will want their respective partner to be the other fast battleship in the team.

While using a CAV is important for this map, you should limit yourself to 1 CAV, 1 AV (must be fast), or Italian CA that can carry Seaplane Fighters for the entirety of the map to reserve at least 3 of your CAVs for the final map.

Also due to the toughness of the final boss, a special attack is recommended to make the fight easier [[Nelson]] is the perfect go to choice for this map as she can be technically used for both bosses. Otherwise, Colorado is the 2nd best option for 2nd boss. [[Nagato]] or [[Mutsu]] are your last options is you lack in the other two. Weigh your options carefully before you take on his map.

===Introduction===

This map will have you doing a total of 6 phases which are while simple will involve extensive work depending on the difficulty:

#Destroy the [[Lycoris Princess]]
# Unlock the path to Node Z
# Unlock the shortcut from C - K
# Fight the [[New Southern Battleship Princess]]
# Debuff the [[New Southern Battleship Princess]]
# Finish the [[New Southern Battleship Princess]]

===Phase 1: Kill Lycoris Hime===
In this phase your fleet will be going up against the [[Lycoris Princess]] for the first phase of the map, for this section you will need a fast surface task force to tackle the operation. Below is the recommended comp:

* '''Recommended Fleet: 2 FBB 1-2 CL 2-3 CA (1 CAV at least) 0-1 AV + 1 CL 1 CA 4 DD (Fast Fleet)'''
** '''Route: A-C-G-K-N-S-X'''
* '''LBAS: Base 1-3 4 Bombers 6 Waves of AD/AP to Node X''' (Range 6)
* This is an Anti-Installation phase so the key things here is Nuke setup to see big damage
*** Node C is Submarine node
*** Consider bringing on OASW DD if possible.
*** Node S is a Yasen Node so it's recommended to use Vanguard formation
*** Organize your fleet your 3 of your DDs at the bottom which will likely survive the hits they take in vanguard formation
*** You will be fighting a total of 3 Battles with 1 SS Node and 2 Surface Node before fighting the boss
** Regardless of difficulty, bring at least 1-2 nuke setup dd or cl
** Your option for Escort Fleet CL should be a 4 slot CL for gun gun 2x wg42
** Have at least one or two ships prepared to fight PT imps by bringing [[Skilled Lookout]] or AA guns.
*** [[Ooyodo]] is a good option for this map as she can carry guns in her RE slots
*** Nuke setup: [[WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)]], [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tanks & Marines)]], [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank]]

Lycoris Princess is vulnerable to T3 shells and LBAS, it is recommended to take T3 shells. She is also accompanied by two Supply Depot Hime, so taking a Nuke-setup in the main fleet is recommended. There are also PT Imps present at that node. Getting Air superiority while helpful isn't entirely necessary, the boss can be beaten easily under air parity as well.

An organized fleet that can tackle with taking down the majority of these enemy units can easily win this section. Continue to attack until she is defeated.

Once the Lycoris Princess is defeated the phase is considered complete.

===Phase 2: Unlocking the path to Node Z===

In this phase of the map you will need to organize your fleet to go to various locations across the map to complete different objectives successfully. In this map, the requirements to reach some of these nodes ,'''especially Node V and node O can differ depending on the difficulty you choose to play'''. While this guide will focus primarily on Hard mode, we will try to node specific things needed for other difficulties if needed.

Below is a list of the requirements for this segment

{{:Summer_2020_Event/E-6/Unlocking_Guide_1}}

The most difficult node to complete these requirements will be node V which '''you will need to return to several times across the map for various requirements (up to 4 times on hard)'''. So prepared to especially revisit this node.


<tabber>
|-| Node B=
* '''Recommended Fleet: (Carrier Task Force) 2 FBB, 2 CV, 1-2 CA(V), 0-1 CL + 1 CL,2 CA 3-4 DD'''
* '''LBAS Recommendation: N/A '''
* '''Path: A-B'''

* You will need 267 Fighter power to get AS at most.
* Depending on the carriers you bring, you may or may not need to go with a fighter mule set up, otherwise you can do so while clearing Node V or O while in route using a standard set up.
<br>
Once the condition is met, a ding sound should occur once you return to homeport.
|-| Node V=
* '''Recommended Fleet 1: (Carrier Task Force) 2 FBB, 2 CV, 2 CA(V) + 1 CL,2 CA 3 DD''' '''(Hard Mode Only)''' (Fast Fleet)
* '''Recommended Fleet 2: (Carrier Task Force) 2-3 (F)BB, 2-3 CV, 1 CA(V) + 0-1 FBB, 1 CL, 1 CA 3-4 DD''' '''(All difficulties)''' (Slow Fleet)

* '''LBAS Recommendation: '''
** LBAS 1: 4 ASW Bombers/ Toukai''' (Target Node M) (Distance of 3 needed)
** LBAS 2 (Option 1): 1 Fighter 3 Bomber ''' (Target Node P and T) (Distance of 4 and 5 needed)
** LBAS 3 (Option 1): 2 Fighter 2 Bomber ''' (Target Node V) (Distance of 6 needed)
** LBAS 2 (Option 2): 2 Fighter 2 Bomber ''' (Target Node V) (Distance of 6 needed)
** LBAS 3 (Option 2): 1 Fighter 3 Bomber ''' (Target Node V) (Distance of 6 needed)
* '''Path: A-B-H-M-P-R-T-V'''

* Below Hard a fast fleet cannot reach Node O, you will need a slow ship in the fleet.
* You must only have 3 DD or less
* Fleet must also be relatively heavy to route to V (See Recommended Fleet 2)
* Node M is Submarines, Bring at least 1 ASW ship to help improve your survivability against the [[New Submarine Princess]]
* Node P and T are a surface fleet full of Torpedo Squadrons. Node P will also have additional battleships in the fleet along with a possible CVL.  Prepare for possible damage for your escort fleet.
** Bringing a FBB in Escort can help improve your survival chances
** In route support is highly recommended
* Node R is an air attack, consider an AACI DD
* Node V is a combined fleet that will consist of 2-3 CVLs, a Ne Kai, 2 Battleships and a possible transport in the main fleet and a pair of CLs and 4 DDs in the fleet.
** You will need to have a strong fleet along with a combination of your Land Base Air Squadron, and In-route support to take down this fleet.
**[[Nelson]], [[Colorado]], or [[Nagato]] can also be a good choice for Node V as she can use the Nelson Touch to help wipe out a fraction of the enemy fleets.
** TCI is also highly recommended to help wipe out the Ne Kai should it live into night battle.
<br>
This node is quite difficult both to approach and to fight through, but depending on the fleet you organize you can eventually take down the combined fleet. Do note you will need to revisit this section several times.
<br>
Once the condition is met, a ding sound should occur once you return to homeport.
|-| Node O=
* '''Recommended Fleet 1: (Carrier Task Force) 2 FBB, 2 CV, 1CA(V), 1 CL + 1 CL,1 CA 4 DD''' '''(Hard Mode Only)''' (Fast Fleet)
* '''Recommended Fleet 2: (Carrier Task Force) 2 (F)BB, 2 CV, 2 CA(V) + 1 CL, 1 CA 4 DD'''(Fast Fleet) '''(Medium or Lower Difficulty)''' (Fast Fleet)
* '''Path: A-B-H-M-L-O'''

* '''LBAS Recommendation:'''

** LBAS 1: 4 ASW Bombers/ Toukai''' (Target Node M) (Distance of 3 needed)
** LBAS 2-3: Rest or Standby

* CVs should be fighter mules
* DDs should bring OASW if necessary to survive Node M
* All other nodes are air attacks AACI is also recommended
<br>
Once the condition is met, a ding sound should occur once you return to homeport.
|-| LB Air Defense=

* '''LBAS: Land Base #3 - 2 Rocket Interceptors, 2 Interceptors (more Land bases needed if necessary) (set on Air Defense)'''

Can be done while doing other requirements as it's easy to complete with minimal effort (preferably while doing Nodes B or O). Just do a run until a land base air raid occurs and the reset should be simple.
<br>
Once the condition is met, a ding sound should occur once you return to homeport.
|-|
</tabber>

Once all conditions are met the path to Node Z will open and you can move on to the next phase

If you need additional help on how to clear these requirements within as few sorties as possible please look at the tips below:

<tabber>
|-| Sortie 1: S rank Node V, M and AS Node B=
** Fleet: 1 FBB 2 CV 1 CAV 1CA 1 AACI DD + 1 FBB 2 CA 1 CL 2 DD
*** Have 1-2 OASW Ship to deal with the Sub Loli Hime on the way to Node V
** Have 1 LBAS with Toukai and ASW Bombers and send them to Node M to S rank that Node as that Node is the New Submarine Hime (Sub Loli)
** Send the last 2 of your LBAS with fighters and Bombers to Node V
** It's Recommended that you bring Node Support Expedition to be able to clear out the Node before V and Node V for easier time to S rank
* TCI is also recommended to help clear Node V
*'''You need to S rank Node V Twice so use the same Sortie 1 again'''
|-| Sortie 2: AS LBAS Defense and AS Node O=
** Fleet: 1 FBB 2 CV 1 CAV 1CA 1 AACI DD + 1 FBB 2 CA 1 CL 2 DD
</tabber>

===Phase 3: Unlock Shortcut C->K===

While this phase is technically skippable, it's recommended to complete this requirement as this route will help you bypass Node G entirely making it so you will only need to bring 1 Seaplane fighter. Everything revolving around this guide from this point onward will assume you will have completed Node C -> K Short cut.

For this phase you will be need to revisit various nodes as well as continue to gain AS from from several nodes below is the following requirement needed to be completed depending on difficulty:

{{:Summer_2020_Event/E-6/Unlocking_Guide_2}}


<tabber>
|-| Node C=

'''Recommended Fleet : (Carrier Task Force) 2 (F)BB, 2 CV, 2 CA(V) + 1 CL, 1 CA 4 DD

* '''Path: A-C
* '''LBAS Recommendation:'''

** LBAS 1-3: N/A Set on Rest or Standby

* Can be done in conjunction with Node G
* CLs and DDs should bring OASW if necessary to clear Node C
* All other nodes are air attacks AACI is also recommended if you plan to go to G at the same time.
<br>
Once the condition is met, a ding sound should occur once you return to homeport.
|-| Node G=

'''Recommended Fleet : (Carrier Task Force) 2 (F)BB, 2 CV, 2 CA(V) + 1 CL, 1 CA 4 DD

* '''Path: A-C-E-G'''

* '''LBAS Recommendation:'''

** LBAS 1-3: N/A Set on Rest or Standby

* Can be done in conjunction with Node C
* CVs should be fighter mules
* Only consider bringing an LBAS full of fighters if for some reason you cannot successfully get AS
* CLs and DDs should bring OASW if necessary to survive Node C and E
* All other nodes are air attacks AACI is also recommended
<br>
Once the condition is met, a ding sound should occur once you return to homeport.

|-| Node O=

'''Refer to Phase 2 Fleet and Land Base Requirements for Node O'''

All steps in this phase are the same as beforehand. Once the condition is met, you will get a ding sound upon returning to home port.

|-| Node V=

'''Refer to Phase 2 Fleet and Land Base Requirements for Node V'''

All steps on this phase are the same as before, follow the same method and defeat the enemy fleet like before. Once the condition is met, you will get a ding sound upon returning to home port.

|-| LB Air Defense=

'''Refer to Phase 2 Land Base Requirements for AS Land Base Defense '''

Once the condition is met a ding sound will occur once you return to home port.
</tabber>

Once all conditions are met, the path to Node C -> K will open.

===Phase 4: the New Southern Battleship Princess===

The following guide section will assume you will have the C->K path unlocked:

In this section you will now be making your way to the final boss of this map, the [[New Southern Battleship Princess]]. In this phase you will be organizing a similar fleet like you used on phase 1 but with some additional changes with the new path unlocked which will make routing easier and allow you to bring in a 3rd battleship in your fleet to help contribute to the delivering the attack against the boss:

* '''Recommended Fleet: STF with 3(F)BB(V) 3CA(V)/AV/CL + CA CL 4DD''' (Fast Fleet)
* '''Recommended LBAS: LBAS 1-3: 4 Land base Bombers or 3 Land Base Bombers + 1 Land Base Recon
* '''Route: A-C-K-N-S-Z'''

** Note the fleet must be Fast to avoid going to the extra Node (Node Q)
** For BB, Use [[Nelson]], [[Kirishima]], [[Hiei]] is recommended here as the Touch on Nelson added with Kirishima and Hiei's historical bonus will wipe out the enemy fleet with ease.
*** For [[Nelson]] make sure she's Fast by equipping her with [[Enhanced Steam Boiler]] + [[Enhanced Steam Boiler]] to make Slow Ships goes Fast
*** If you lack [[Nelson]], [[Colorado]] can work as a good alternative.
*** If you lack either, [[Nagato|Nagato Kai Ni]] or [[Mutsu|Mutsu Kai Ni]] can use [[Kirishima]] as your second ship.
*** There is an option to have [[Nelson]], [[Colorado]], [[Nagato|Nagato Kai Ni]] or [[Mutsu|Mutsu Kai Ni]] with 1 Main gun + AP Shell + Type 3 Shell (Sanshiki) for buff stacking purposes when using her Touch mechanics.
** Use any of the Historical DD and have them setup for TCI with 2-3 Torpedoes to kill the boss quickly and efficiently.
**Bringing your [[Night scout]], [[Searchlight]] and [[Star Shell]] along with [[Skilled Lookout]] can be effective for helping you make it easier to proc TCI in night battle.
***Be aware of Node S's Night battle node, which might make passing with a searchlight user difficult.

The [[New Southern Battleship Princess]] comes with a fleet consisting of Battleship Princesses, Ne-Class Kai (Summer Mode) and an array of Light Cruiser, in Main Fleet, while escort will have Light Cruisers and Destroyers.

While the boss has no air power, it should be warned that due to the enemy combined fleet having many AA based units (such as the Tsu-class Flagship and the Ne-class Kai) it very possible for the boss to nuke your entire Land Base Air Squardron's plane ranks with ease.

Do however note that all you need to have is one Seaplane fighter to secure Air Supremacy. The boss fleet while tanky can be effectively taken down with the combination of your Land Base, Boss Support and hoping that one of your Big 7 Battleship member's special attack proc allows your fleet the chance to potentially wipe out at least 3 of the heavily armored units in the main fleet. Everything else will ride down to how much you can effectively damage the princess and the rest of her fleet.

If all goes well, but at night battle you ships that are armed with TCI should take care of the rest. Keep in mind, the [[New Souther Battleship Princess]] has armor that is very high on hard difficulty and will need several historical TCIs to finish her off.

Continue until you reach LD, once there, you can decide if you want to do the debuff or continue to attempt to deliver the final blow.

===Phase 5: Debuff the New Southern Battleship Princess===

The following guide section will assume you will have the C->K path unlocked:

From this point if you choose to commence with the debuff steps for this map, you will have a lot of steps that will need to be completed.

For this phase we will cover each step individually followed by the most effective method to try to clear several of the requirements at once.

The requirements needed for this phase are relatively large and a lot of steps are needed to complete the steps below is the list of requirements:

{{:Summer_2020_Event/E-6/Unlocking_Guide_3}}

* For Fleet Comps 1-3 partial or full fighter mule needed
* For Fleet Comp 3 please refer to other recommended comps to plan out a way to safely pass other nodes.
* Bring ASW for some DDs in escort
* STF method (Fleet Comp 4) is preferred as it will take an easier approach compared to CTF.
* Node Q is another torpedo squadron consisting of Heavy cruisers, light cruisers and DD.

Once the conditions are met a ding sound will occur upon returning to base.
|-| Node V=

'''Refer to Phase 2 Fleet and Land Base Requirements for Node V'''

All steps in this phase are the same as before, follow the same method and defeat the enemy fleet like before. DO note however that the enemy fleet especially on M have slightly increased in difficulty.

Once the condition is met, you will get a ding sound upon returning to home port.

|-| Node X=

* '''Recommended Fleet: 2 FBB 1 CL 2 CA (1 CAV at least) 1SS(V) or [[Shinshuu Maru]] + 1 CL 1 CA 4 DD (Fast Fleet)'''
** '''Route: A-C-K-N-S-X'''
* '''LBAS: Base 1-3 10-1 Fighter, 3-4 Bombers 6 Waves of AD/AP to Node X''' (Range 6)

*To be able to route to Node X in this phase you muse has an SSV or [[Shinshuu Maru]] in your fleet.
* Fleet must be fast
* All processes on how to fight Node X is the same as Phase 1.
**Please refer to phase 1 on how to handle the boss.

Once conditions are met, you will get a ding sound upon returning to Home Port.

|-| LB Air Defense=

'''Refer to Phase 2 Land Base Requirements for AS Land Base Defense '''

Once the condition is met a ding sound will occur once you return to home port.

Due to sheer complexity of the steps needed below is a guide with an example you can consider for meeting most if not all the requirements in 4 Sorties:

From here are the steps for taking care multiple requirements at onces:
<tabber>
|-|Sortie 1: Node X=
** To get to Node X use STF with [[Shinshuumaru]] or Speed Mod (Fast) a SSV in Main Fleet
** You can use the same fleet as you did when you fight SoDak Hime but just replace one ship for [[Shinshuumaru]] or Fast a SSV
|-|Sortie 2: Node M, P and V=
** Fleet: 1 FBB 2 CV 1 CAV 1CA 1 AACI DD + 1 FBB 2 CA 1 CL 2 DD
*** Have 1-2 OASW Ship to deal with the Sub Loli Hime on the way to Node V
** Have 1 LBAS with Toukai and ASW Bombers and send them to Node M to S rank that Node as that Node is the New Submarine Hime (Sub Loli)
** Send the last 2 of your LBAS with fighters and Bombers to Node V
** It's Recommended that you bring Node Support Expedition to be able to clear out the Node before V and Node V for easier time to S rank
|-|Sortie 3: Node F & Q & LBAS Defense Once=
* Use a Slow STF with 3 BB 1 CAV 1 CV 1 CL
** You can use anything in Escort fleet but the most important part is the Main Fleet
** This requirement doesn't rely on LBAS so you can set them up for Defense purposes while clearing out these requirements
|-|Sortie 4: Node L and LBAS Defense with Fast CTF=
** The Fleet must contain 6 CL/DD, 2 or less CA
*** Example: 2 FBB 2 CV 1 CL 1 CAV + 1 Cl 5 DD
** This requirement doesn't rely on LBAS so you can set them up for Defense purposes while clearing out these requirements
</tabber>
===Phase 6: Deliver the final blow against New Southern Battleship Princess===

* Fleet: Same as Phase 4

* Route: A-C-K-N-S-Y, Node Types see above

* LBAS: 6 Waves of 4LBAA or 3LBAA + LBAS Recon to Y.

* Notes: Abyssal South Dakota is accompanied by a lot of Sponge and new Na-Class Destroyers capable of Opening Torpedo attacks in the escort fleet. 2-4 historical TCI are recommended to be present in the Escort fleet, as are means to ensure their proc rate (Searchlight, Flares, Skilled lookouts in RE). If you are taking a searchlight with you, you might want to consider putting that ship into the 4th slot of the escort fleet to tank on Node S and equip them with a damagecon (LD only). The main Fleet will benefit from having a special attack like Nelson Touch or Colorado Broadside incorporating the Bonus ships Hiei and Kirishima into it for extra damage. T3 shells deal Bonus damage to the boss, but equipping Hiei and Kirishima with APCI will still be more beneficial. Only one SPF in the main fleet is needed to ensure AS+ on all nodes. Boss Support is recommended, Node support (Either ASW or Shelling Support) is optional.

* Editors note: Preserving Chevrons: If you are at LD and see that a failure is imminent and you dont want to lose your LBAS chevrons to the very high enemy AA on this node you can forfeit your drop on this node by refreshing the game page before the battle result screen is loaded. This will still have you pay the Bauxite and repair costs, but you save time as max proficiency LBAA has higher hit and crit rate which are needed on this boss.

Once the Princess is sunk, the event map is deemed complete.
