==Introduction==
熟練搭乗員によって編成された「二式水戦」装備の水戦隊です。新型水上戦闘機「強風」実戦投入までの繋ぎとして、零式艦上戦闘機をベースに急遽開発/実戦投入された水上戦闘機、二式水戦。元々は艦上運用を考慮した機材ではありませんでしたが、機体及びフロート強度を改良強化して投入です。

A squadron to Type 2 Seaplane Fighters operated by skilled crewman.  Intended as a holdover until the introduction of the new fighter "Kyoufu" (Reppu?) these are Type 0 Fighters hurriedly converted to and deployed as seaplane fighters, and called the Type 2 Hydro Fighter.  Although it was not originally designed with floats for shipboard operations, these aircraft have reinforced and improved seaplane floats.
