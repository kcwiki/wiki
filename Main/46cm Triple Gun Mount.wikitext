==Introduction==
呉海軍工廠砲熕部が極秘開発した世界最大最強の戦艦主砲です。<br />
敵戦艦に対してアウトレンジが可能な最大射程40kmを超える最新鋭のこの巨砲は、
機密保持のため公式には16インチ砲とされていました。<br />
「三式弾」を用いた強力な対空射撃も可能です。

Developed in absolute secrecy at the Kure Naval Arsenal's Artillery Division, this is the largest and most powerful battleship gun in the world.<br>
It is a state-of-the-art gun capable of outranging enemy battleships with it's maximum range in excess of 40km. To ensure secrecy, it is officially designated as a 16 inch gun.<br>
It is capable of strong anti-air fire when used alongside the Type 3 Shell.


Officially the largest calibered guns ever equipped on warships. In real world it was only equipped on purposely built Yamato class, but in Kancolle world even Kongou can carry this (the entire turret weighs some 2800 tons). After the war, the technologies used to rotate this turret was applied to the mechanicals of revolving restaurant on top of Hotel New Otani. The lathe used to machine the barrel of 46cm guns are still active today at Kure. 

==Note==
Buildable. Stock equipment of [[Yamato]] and [[Musashi]]. Has the longest shelling range.  

This is also the only main cannon other than the [[10cm Twin High-angle Mount]] that provides an additional bonus to fleet anti-air defense. 

This cannon is also speculated to have overweight penalties when used on fast battleships, decreasing accuracy by a certain amount. It is advised not to use two or more in a combined fleet because of the augmentation of accuracy penalties in combined fleets.
