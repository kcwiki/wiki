Speed {{Speed}} represents the speed of a ship girl. Ship girls are either '''slow (低速)''' or '''fast (高速)''' by default. As of the [[Game_Updates/2017/January_10|10 Jan 2017 Update]], ship girl speed can be further increased to '''fast+ (高速+)''' or '''fastest (最速)''' by using a combination of [[Improved Kanhon Type Turbine]], [[Enhanced Kanhon Type Boiler]] or [[New Model High Temperature High Pressure Boiler]].

[[File:Yamatofast.png|thumb|right|By equipping a Turbine and an Engine it's possible to make Battleship like Yamato go from slow to fast. As shown here, using a [[Improved Steam Turbine]] (shown in the expansion slot) and an [[Enhanced Steam Boiler]] will result in Yamato going to '''Fast''' allowing her access to path branching she would otherwise not have access to when she was '''Slow'''.]]
There are several effects of increasing ship girl speed:

* Meeting routing requirements.
** Slow ships can be sped up to fulfil certain branching requirements.
*** Note that this does not apply to ''ship type'' requirements. Eg a BB will not count as a FBB where FBBs are specifically required.
** Fast+ and fastest are required to fulfil routing requirements in some maps. Eg. [[World 3#3-2|3-2]] and [[World 4#4-5|4-5]].
* [[Combined Fleet]] composition.
** Slow battleships that are fast+ can be placed in the escort fleet.
* Evasion increase.
** Although this has been stated by the developers to occur, testing has not shown any significant increase in evasion.
* Because [[Destroyer Escorts]] cannot be equipped with a turbine, they are the only ship type that '''cannot be sped up'''.







=Speed Change Charts=

It is '''highly recommended''' that you have a [[Reinforcement Expansion]] on ship girls that you wish to speed up. It can '''severely degrade''' their combat efficiency if you attempt to speed up ship girls without one.

* {{Equipment/Link|Enhanced Kanhon Type Boiler}} = +10 Boiler
* {{Equipment/Link|New Model High Temperature High Pressure Boiler}} = +13 Boiler

'''''All synergies listed below already include 1 {{Equipment/Link|Improved Kanhon Type Turbine}} because it is an absolute requirement for speed ups.'''''
