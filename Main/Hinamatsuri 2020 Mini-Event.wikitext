The '''2020 Hinamatsuri Mini event''' is scheduled to begin on '''March 3rd, 2020''' and is expected to last for 3 weeks. According to this [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/1237177209451769856 Tweet], it will end in the '''second half of the week of 22-28 March 2020'''. This event serves as a substitute/filler for the Winter 2020 Event. The title of this event is '''Peach Festival! Offshore Waves'''

Unlike previous events, this event will not contain any new ships but will instead offer players a chance to '''earn items to use for remodels'''. To further top it off, the mini-event is planned to have its own limited time event map location much like a traditional event.

The event map area will consist of 1 map only. And will consist of 3 phases: 1 Transport Phase, 1 Anti-installation Phase, 1 Carrier Task Force Interception Mission.

===Fleet Formations===
Friend Fleets will now come with a new function which will allow players to choose if they wish to bring in a Friend Fleet to aid them in battle or not. They can also choose to also decide if they want a normal Friend Fleet come aid them in battle or if they wish to use a powerful Friend Fleet that will require the cost of '''6 Instant Constructions''' [[File:Instant_construction-0.jpg]] to allow you call in a more powerful Friend Fleet to aid you into battle. 

If you choose to opt in for the powerful Friend fleet, the '''Instant Constructions''' [[File:Instant_construction-0.jpg]] will not be consumed unless a powerful Friend Fleet appears.

==Mechanics==
===Participation requirements===
*Must have a 75% sortie win ratio.
*Must have 5 empty ship slots for new ships.
*Must have 20 free equipment slots.

===Special Mechanics===
#The difficulty system first used in [[Spring 2015 Event]] returns: you can choose between Operation A ({{lang|ja|甲}}, Hard), Operation B ({{lang|ja|乙}}, Medium), Operation C ({{lang|ja|丙}}, Easy) or Operation D ({{lang|ja|丁}}, Very Easy) .
#*Choosing A or B requires certain HQ Level (HQ Lv 35 for B / 80 for A in Spring 2015 Event).
#*'''An important note''' to all Admirals intending to clear the event on Hard difficulty - further (new) conditions now apply:'''
#**When switching difficulty from ''any other difficulty'' to Hard, the map's debuff mechanism (where applicable) will be reset.
#***Switching between any other difficulties will not reset the debuff mechanism.
#The debuff system from [[Summer 2015 Event]]'s final map, where certain nodes had to be attacked and other conditions fulfilled to reduce boss armor, will return.
<!---# It is possible that a fleet with '''seven''' ships ('''[[Striking Force Fleet]]''') will be allowed to sortie to certain event maps that permit '''single fleet operations'''.
#*The Striking Force '''cannot''' be sortied during exercises or sent on expeditions while it contains seven ships.
#*The Striking Force can only be created and used in the '''third''' fleet in the menu (out of a total of four fleets).
#*A Striking Force with a flagship that carries a new piece of equipment, the '''[[Striking Force Fleet Command Facility]]''', will be able to make use of the new '''Single Ship Evacuation''' mechanic.
#**The new Striking Force Fleet Command Facility will become obtainable and useable via the old [[Fleet Command Facility]] and the '''Action Report'''.
#***Note that the [[Quests#F64|relevant quest]] will consume the [[Fleet Command Facility]] in order to convert it into the new [[Striking Force Fleet Command Facility]].
#**Supplementary information regarding the new [[Striking Force Fleet Command Facility]] and the Single Ship Evacuation it allows when carried by the striking force's flagship:
#***The evacuation does not require an escort destroyer.
#***The evacuation consumes the ship's entire fuel & ammo reserves. 
#***Only one ship can be evacuated per battle.
#***'''The damage the ship suffered may become worse during the evacuation, but she will never sink.'''--->
# Returning this event, the '''Vanguard Formation''' can be used .
#*This formation will organize the fleet such that the 3rd-6th/7th ships protect the Flagship and 2nd Ship of the Fleet.
#**In addition, the formation allows for ships to become more evasive in combat situations, especially with well-trained Destroyer.
#** This formation is also available '''only during the duration of the event.'''
#**The formation will be usable by [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/930623111862435841 both] normal fleets as well as the Striking Force Fleet.
#'''NPC Friend Fleets''' have been introduced into the game.
#* Friend Fleets act as another unit that appears in particular battles to help aid your fleet when attacking the enemy at the start of night battle.
#** NPC Friend Fleets are selected from a randomized preset list of ship.
#** Depending on who you have in your fleet can also influence who will be arrive to aid you in battle.
#'''Enemy Radar Ambush Nodes''' have been introduced into the game.
#* Entering this node will result in your fleet facing off against an enemy fleet that will ambush and attack your fleet 
#** Your Fleet will not be able to fight against the enemy Fleet.
#** By meeting certain conditions, you can evade these nodes.
#[[Repairs#Emergency_Anchorage_Repair|'''Emergency Anchorage Maintenance/Repairs''']] 【緊急泊地修理】
#*Both [[Akashi|Akashi Kai]] and [[Akitsushima|Akitsushima Kai]] will be capable of conducting emergency repairs; however, Akitsushima has more limited capabilities compared to Akashi.
#*See under [[Repairs#Emergency_Anchorage_Repairs|Emergency Anchorage Repairs]] for details.
#[[Land-Based_Air_Squadron#High_Altitude_Air_Raid|'''High-Altitude Abyssal Bombers''']] that are resistant to all types of interceptors other than the new land-based jet interceptors may also return this event.

==Quests==
In this event there are a total of 13 quests that can be completed. These quests are all tied to the Hinamatsuri Event. Some quests will provide [[Hishimochi]] as rewards, which are required and consumed by others in exchange for other rewards. Clearing the map on any difficulty also rewards [[Hishimochi]] (the exact number varies according to difficulty).

Due to the number of [[Hishimochi]] consumed by certain quests, as well as the various overlapping unlock requirements for respective quests, it is important to take into account which quests unlock others, what difficulty you intend to clear the map on, as well as the weekly reset at 0500 JST on Mondays. For example, some players may find it useful to rush quest '''[[Hinamatsuri_2020_Mini-Event#20WiB3|20WiB3]]''' to unlock the weekly '''[[Hinamatsuri_2020_Mini-Event#20WiB4|20WiB4]]''', before resetting the map to clear on a higher difficulty.

It is also inadvisable to consume [[Hishimochi]] via the items menu, as the number of Hishimochi available during this event is '''very''' limited and the rewards from quests that consume them are more likely to pay off in the long run.

Please see [[Talk:Hinamatsuri_2020_Mini-Event]] for the breakdown of Mochi rewards vs consumptions.

'''Preparations'''

As this event does not have any shiplocks, there is no restriction on who you can use for the event. Therefore, you are welcome to use all ships available.

As of this time, the following ships are known to have historical bonuses:
<tabber>
|-|Nodes A, D, E, I=
1.15x
*Rei-Gou Ships: [[Kasumi]], [[Ashigara]], [[Ooyodo]], [[Kiyoshimo]], [[Asashimo]]
*[[Kiso]], [[Ushio]], [[Akebono]], [[Hatsuharu]] 

1.2x
*[[Akishimo]],[[Okinami]]
|-|Node J (Boss #2)=
1.25x
*Rei-Gou Ships: [[Kasumi]], [[Ashigara]], [[Ooyodo]], [[Kiyoshimo]], [[Asashimo]]
|-|Nodes L, Q, R=
1.15x
*[[Chikuma]], [[Choukai]], [[Johnston]], [[Kasumi]]

1.2x
*[[Asashimo]], [[Naganami]], [[Hatsushimo]], [[Shimakaze]], [[Ushio]]
|-|Node T (Boss #3, after Q->T unlock)=
1.4x
*[[Chikuma]], [[Choukai]], [[Samuel B. Roberts]], [[Johnston]]

1.52x
*[[Naganami]], [[Kiyoshimo]], [[Asashimo]], [[Okinami]], [[Yuugumo]], [[Makigumo]], [[Kazagumo]]

1.17x
*All Other Ships

</tabber>

This map contains 1 TP bar and 2 HP bars that must be depleted in order to complete the map.
*Phase 1: Deplete the TP bar by securing multiple A or S ranks at Node I
*Phase 2: Deplete the first HP bar by damaging (then sinking) the [[Supply Depot Princess II]] at Node J
*Phase 3: Open the shortcut Q-T 
*Phase 4: Deplete the last HP bar by damaging (then sinking) the [[Aircraft Carrier Princess]] at Node T.
2 LBAS are available for you to sortie (Airbase defence is also possible)

'''Phase 1: Transport Operation'''
Transport Combined Fleet '''1CAV 1CL 4DD + 1CL 2CA(V) 3DD'''<br/>
Transport Combined Fleet '''1CVE 1AV 4DD + 2CL 4DD'''
*Routes BADFHI
*As this is a Transport Operation, you are recommended to bring as many Drum Canisters and Daihatsu Landing Craft as possible
*LBAS: 1 Base of ASW bombers to Node D , another base of all bombers to Boss Node
'''E -> J''' route will be revealed once this phase is over

'''Phase 1 Boss post-clear farming'''

On Hard mode, once this phase has been completed, you can always go back to this boss node to farm a lot of rare ships such as [[Sado]], [[Tsushima]] and [[Maruyu]]. A '''single fleet such as 1CVL 2CLT 1CL 1CL/(F)BB(V) 1AV''' should be strong enough to S rank the boss node reliably (Routes ADFHI)

'''Phase 2: Defeating Supply Depot Princess B'''

The boss in Phase 2 is a newer version of the [[Supply Depot Princess]], accompanied by some [[Artillery Imp]]s and [[PT Imp]]s. Refer to the [[Combat/Anti-Installation|Anti-Installation]] page for details.

Single Fleet '''1CA 1CL 4DD'''
*Routes ADGJ
*Avoiding the E node that contains Ne Kai, but will have to go through [[New Submarine Princess]] node, followed by an air raid node.
*There are PT Imp Groups at the boss node, certain equipment such as [[Skilled Lookouts]] may be required to counter them
*LBAS: 1 Base of ASW bombers to Node D , another base of all bombers to Boss Node

'''Phase 3: Opening the shortcut'''

**S rank node J: Same comp as Phase 2
**AS node G: 1BB 2CAV 3CV(B)
*Carrier Task Force 
**AS node C: 1FBB 2CAV 3CV(B) + 1CL 2CA 3DD
**AS node O: 1FBB 2CAV 2CV Akitsushima Kai + 1CL 2CA 3DD ('''All Fast''')
*Transport Combined Fleet, S rank node D and I: Same comp as Phase 1
*Surface Task Force / Carrier Task Force, S rank node R: 1FBB 2CVL 2CAV Akitsushima Kai + 1CL 2CA(V) 3DD ('''All Fast''')
*Achieve AS during LBAS defence

'''Phase 4: Defeating Aircraft Carrier Princess'''

Now that Friend Fleets have been added to the map, please be aware that using certain ships (e.g. [[Akagi]], [[Iowa]], [[Saratoga]], [[Johnston]], etc.) may lock you out of stronger FF compositions.

Carrier Task Force '''2FBB 2CV(B) 1CAV Akitsushima Kai / Akashi Kai + 1CL 1CLT 2CA(V) 2DD (All Fast)'''
*Routes BDKLMOPQT
*On Hard mode, the boss node has very high air power. You may need 700 air or more to be able to score AS there, which is not strictly required (especially prior to LD)
*M node is the anchorage repair node
*L node contains a lot of PT Imp Groups, certain equipment such as [[Skilled Lookouts]] may be required to counter them
*LBAS: 1 Base of ASW bombers to Node D , another base of all bombers or 1 [[Type 2 Land-based Reconnaissance Aircraft]] + 3 bombers to Boss Node
**It is possible for LBAS to obtain AD at the boss, if [[Type 2 Land-based Reconnaissance Aircraft (Skilled)]] + [[Type 1 Fighter Hayabusa Model II (64th Air Squadron)]] + 2x [[Type 1 Land Attacker Model 34]] (at least one must have +4 stars) are used
**On the Final Kill, it may be more preferable to send both bases full of LBAA to the boss node instead (Adding [[Type 2 Land-based Reconnaissance Aircraft]] is also an option)


Surface Task Force '''3BB 1CV 1CAV Akitsushima Kai + 1CL 2DD 1AO 2CA(V)/CLT''' (or other possibilities)
*Routes ABDKLMOPQT
*Arguably better pass rate along the route, but faces one additional surface battle node at node A
*Should '''only be used for LD''' due to higher difficulty
**1-2 [[Maritime Resupply]] may be required to avoid the ammo penalty, depending on route
*Other variations exist:
**E.g. routing through air raid node N instead of M by dropping Akitsushima for another ship
**AO in main fleet instead of escort to allow for more night battle ships
**[[Atlanta]] in main fleet for AACI, using [[Ise|Ise Kai Ni]] to provide supplementary FP
**Etc.
