==Ship Bonuses (Tentative)==

{{:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/E-3/Historical_Ships}}

==General Information==

This map has three ship locks:
*{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag4}}Orange Tag: 2nd Torpedo Squadron (Single Fleet)
*{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag6}}Grey Tag: 8th Fleet (Single Fleet, '''with CA(V) flagship''')
**Starting point unlocks after Phase 1 is cleared
**Only really used for one unlocking gimmick
*{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag5}}Yellow Tag: Combined Fleet (Combined Fleet)
**Same starting point as Orange Tag, but tagged with Combined Fleet Tag when sortied as a Combined Fleet (STF or CTF)

* There are three LBAS Bases available to you, with 2 for offensive operations and one for base defense

==Phase 1: TP Phase==

Phase 1 is a TP Phase, with 350/350/500/750 points required on Casual/Easy/Medium/Hard at HQ 120

*Composition:{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag4}}{{ToolTip|[Orange Tag]|'''2nd Torpedo Squadron'''}} 0-1 CL, 5-6 DD
**A fleet with CL will off-route to {{MapRoute|E|red}}
*Route: {{MapRoute|A|blue|C|red|G|red|F|blue|I|blue|J|red|L|purple|M|green|N|red}} with 0 CL
**{{MapRoute|A|blue|C|red|E|red|G|red|F|blue|I|blue|J|red|L|purple|M|green|N|red}} with 1 CL
*'''A total of 0/2/3/4 drum-equipped ships are required on Casual/Easy/Medium/Hard for this route.'''
*LBAS:
**2 LBAS with 4x LBAA each to boss (7 Range); OR
**1 LBAS with 4x Toukai/ASW to {{MapRoute|C|red}} (2 Range), 1 LBAS with 4x LBAA to Boss; OR
**Fighter sweep {{MapRoute|E|red|G|red}}
*Notes: 
**Support expeditions are optional, vanguard formation can be used to increase passing rate. Generic AACI is sufficient for the Air Raids.
**S-Ranking the boss is not strictly necessary, but if desired, the new Torpedo/SLO+/Torpedo and/or Torpedo/SLO+/Drum cut-ins may be useful.
***With a [[Reinforcement Expansion]] unlocked, a Torpedo/Torpedo/Drum/[SLO+] set-up may be utilized.
***SLO+ refers to [[Torpedo Squadron Skilled Lookouts]].
**This phase has '''no LoS check'''.

==Phase 1.5: Unlock the 2nd Boss Node==
Unlocking {{MapRoute|W|Red}} has 4 total requirements. The dabber will show you a composition that you can use to complete multiple nodes in a single sortie.

** Fleet must be '''FAST''' to avoid routing to the extra node: {{MapRoute|O|red}}
</tabber>

==Phase 2: Defeat the Enemy Combined Fleet==
The objective here is to take down the enemy combined fleet at Node {{MapRoute|W|Red}}

<tabber> 
|-|STF=
* Composition:{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag5}}{{ToolTip|[Yellow Tag]|'''Combined Fleet'''}} Surface Task Force (STF): 2 CVL, 2 FBB, 1-2 CA(V), 1-2 CL + 1 CA, 1 CL, 4 DD

</tabber>

==Phase 2.5: Unlock the Route to Node Z==
To unlock {{MapRoute|Z|Red}}, you will need to do the following requirements depending on your difficulty with the map.

! G

|-
| Hard

|}
* Composition:{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag5}}{{ToolTip|[Yellow Tag]|'''Combined Fleet'''}} Transport Combined Fleet (TCF): 0-1 CVE, 1CAV/AV, 4-5 DD + 1 CL, 3 DD
* Route: {{MapRoute|A|blue|C|red|E|red|G|red|F|blue|H|red}}
* Alternatively you can run{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag4}}{{ToolTip|[Orange Tag]|'''2nd Torpedo Squadron'''}} 1 AV 5 DD in order to save locks as the fleet is similar to Phase 1 and 3.
** If using the single fleet method, you need to use a 4-slot AV like [[Commandant Teste]] or [[Nisshin]]. 3-slot girls will struggle to take AS against all but the weakest enemy composition. 
** Route: {{MapRoute|A|blue|C|red|E|red|G|red|F|blue|H|red}}
* LBAS: Range 5, AP/AS for Hard: 160/359
* Note: Set up your LBAS with fighters only and send them to Node H to help secure AS.
** 1 CVE and 1 CAV with full fighter & SPF set-ups can almost certainly attain AS without the need for LBAS swapping.
* Note: '''EASY/CASUAL''' will have node {{MapRoute|Z|Red}} unlocked as soon as you beat phase 2 without doing these steps

==Phase 3: Defeat Lunga Hime==
This is the final phase for this map and the MO. The objective is to sink the Lunga princess at {{MapRoute|Z|red}}. There is a boss debuff available for unlocking once LD is reached, if so desired. 
* Composition:{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag4}}{{ToolTip|[Orange Tag]|'''2nd Torpedo Squadron'''}} Single Fleet: 6 DD ''' OR''' 1 CL 5 DD ('''EASY AND CASUAL ONLY''')
**A fleet with CL will off-route to {{MapRoute|E|red}}
* Route: {{MapRoute|A|blue|C|red|G|red|F|blue|I|blue|X|red|M|green|Z|red}} with 0 CL
** {{MapRoute|A|blue|C|red|E|red|G|red|F|blue|I|blue|X|red|M|green|Z|red}} with 1 CL
* LBAS: Range 8, no Airpower 
* Note: '''Fleet must have 0/3/4/5 drum-equipped ships on Casual/Easy/Medium/Hard.'''
*LoS Requirement: About '''Cn3 48+/38+/29+/23+''' is required on '''Hard/Medium/Easy/Casual''' to route from {{MapRoute|M|green}} to {{MapRoute|Z|red}}.

==Lunga Hime Debuff Phase==
You can do all these steps in any order. There are 6 requirements that must be met once Last Dance threshold has been reached:
* LBAS raid - AS x1
* {{MapRoute|O3|red}} - S rank x1
* {{MapRoute|E|red}} - AS x1
* {{MapRoute|W|red}} - S rank x1
* {{MapRoute|K|red}} - S rank x1
* {{MapRoute|N|red}} - S rank x1 (use TCF to reach)
