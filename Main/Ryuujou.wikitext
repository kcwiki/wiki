===Analysis===
* Kai: '''Low'''
: She has low firepower and plane count combined with a terrible slot distribution. Her single large slot isn't enough to make up for the rest of her slots being very small. Being the 2nd slot, it also means she can lose the plane proficiency bonus or artillery spotting easily. Her slots don't allow her to do much than be a fighter mule.

* Kai Ni: '''Medium'''
: She gains a significant improvement to her firepower and plane count. Her slot distribution also improves a bit with the top slot increasing in size. It's still risky to bring her against heavy anti-air but her slots are usable now. Her slot setup allows her to bring both a decent airstrike and fighter power to sorties. 

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat - Kai Ni
* Air Support - Kai Ni
* Shelling Support - Kai Ni

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Combat - Kai
