==Trivia==
* First appeared during [[Winter 2015 Event]] as the E-3 boss flagship. Also appeared at E-5-A.
* Next appeared in the [[Spring 2015 Event]] as an escort ship in E-1's boss final form on hard as well as E-3-E.
* Now constantly appears at [[World 4#4-5|World 4-5]], node H. (Both the stronger and weaker forms can appear.)
* Her weaker form is based on [[Naka]] while her stronger form is based on [[Agano]], as hinted by their artwork and a branching rule in E-4 of the [[Winter 2015 Event]].
