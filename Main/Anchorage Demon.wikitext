==Trivia==
Was the first initial boss type Abyssal introduced in the game. While technically was an installation, due to game mechanics lacking in them back in the [[Spring 2013 Event]], she was easy to enough to take down with just with just regular shelling attacks.
*E-3 Boss (May 2013 Event)
*E-2 Boss (Fall 2013 Event)

===Arcade Version===
The Arcade Version of Anchorage Demon functions more like an installation and while can be still defeated with just regular shelling attacks, she is more vulnerable to [[Type 3 Shell]] attacks.
