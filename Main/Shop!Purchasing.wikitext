==Introduction==
There are in-game items that can be acquired only by using real money in the [[Shop]]. This is a tutorial on how to "''hatemyour money, love your ship girls''".

There are two relevant currencies that are intertwined, but different from one amother.

* '''DMM Money''' is the monetary amount you have on your DMM account. This is real-world money that DMM has in your name. It cannot yet be used to purchase in-game items.
* '''DMM Points''' are the currency with which you buy in-game items. Thus, you will need to convert DMM Money into DMM Points in order to purchase in-game items.

==FAQ==
===Does DMM accept Debit Cards?===

Yes. The amount you spent will be deducted from your bank account within 2 weeks. 

===An error occurred when I input my Credit Card!===
Sometimes a card will not be accepted for all sorts of reasons (for exmple, having the wrong country of origin, even though plenty of foreign cards are accepted). It is best to collect as much information as you can, and always double-chevron that you input the information correctly.

===WebMoney is expensive!===
Yes it is. It is better to use a credit/debit card.

===Does DMM allow refunds?===
You may be refunded when you unsubscribe from their site.

=== Why does the WebMoney-as-payment option not appearing in the DMM site? ===
Consult with this guide: http://bit.ly/HateYourWebMoney

=== Why is there no purchase popup after I buy an item?  The page just seems to hang. ===
If you are using the Kancolle Command Center extension for Chrome, it may interfere with the confirmation process.
Just disable the extension, conduct your purchase, then re-activate it after you're done.  This has been resolved in the upgraded version known as KC3改.
