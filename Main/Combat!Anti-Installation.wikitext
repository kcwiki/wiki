=Introduction=

Installations are an enemy type in game that is characterised by high armour and high HP. They are difficult to handle using normal anti-ship setups and require specific setups in order to destroy. Installations are typically found as bosses or as boss escorts. 

=General Characteristics=

* They cannot be targeted by torpedoes.
** Opening and closing torpedoes will fail to trigger if only installation targets remain.
* The torpedo stat is '''ignored''' when calculating night battle damage against installations. Please see [[Night Battle]] for more details.
** This makes destroyers, light cruisers and heavy cruisers much weaker unless equipped with anti-installation equipment.
* Submarines can attack installations during shelling if equipped with a {{EquipmentLink|Special Type 2 Amphibious Tank}}.
** They will be able to attack installations at night regardless of equipment.
** Their low firepower makes them poor anti-installation ships.
* Only '''dive bombers''' will attack installations during the air strike phase.
* Carriers will only attack installations in the shelling phase if equipped with '''torpedo bombers or [[:Category:Anti-Installation Dive Bomber|anti-installation dive bombers]]'''. 
** The special dive bombers are:
*** [[Type 99 Dive Bomber Model 22]]
*** [[Type 99 Dive Bomber Model 22 (Skilled)]]
*** [[Ju 87C Kai]]
*** [[Ju 87C Kai Ni (w/ KMX)]]
*** [[Ju 87 C Kai 2 (w/ KMX / Skilled)]]
*** [[Prototype Nanzan]]
*** [[Suisei Model 12 (634 Air Group w/ Type 3 Cluster Bombs)]]
*** [[Suisei Model 12 (w/ Type 31 Photoelectric Fuze Bombs)]]
*** [[FM-2]]
*** [[F4U-1D]]
*** [[SB2C-3]]
*** [[SB2C-5]]
** Any other dive bomber will completely disable shelling against installations even if the carrier has a torpedo bomber equipped.
** This can be very useful to '''manipulate the targeting mechanic so the carriers attack important targets'''.
* Carriers are '''unable to perform cut-ins''' on installations, even if equipped with anti-installation dive bombers.
* They have different damage statuses instead of the normal ones used for ships.

=Installation Classification=

Installations are classified by two categories, Ship Type (BB, BBV, CV) and skin toughness (Hard, Soft). 

===Ship Type===
'''Battleship (BB)'''
* Examples are [[Artillery Imp]]s and [[Central Princess]].
* They use the [[Damage_Calculations#Surface_Shelling|surface shelling formula]] for calculating damage.
* They use the shelling attack animation in day and night battle.
* They '''can continue attacking''' when moderately damaged.

'''Aviation Battleship (BBV)'''
* Most installations fall under this category. 
* They use the [[Damage_Calculations#Carrier_Attacks|carrier attack formula]] for calculating damage.
* They use the shelling attack animation in day and night battle.
* They cannot attack during the day if heavily damaged.
* They are forced to attack submarines if they have equipment with an ASW {{ASW}} stat.

'''Carrier (CV)'''
* Example is [[Lycoris Princess]].
* They use the [[Damage_Calculations#Carrier_Attacks|carrier attack formula]] for calculating damage.
* They use the carrier attack animation in day battle and the shelling animation at night.
* They cannot attack during the day if moderately damaged.
* They do not enable the 2nd shelling phase if there is no battleship present.

===Skin Toughness===
'''Soft Skin'''
* Examples are [[Supply Depot Princess]], [[Harbor Princess]], and [[Northern Princess]].
* Take a lot of damage from [[:Category:Anti-Aircraft_Shells|anti-aircraft shells]] and less from other anti-installation equipment.
** They still take a decent amount of damage from other anti-installation equipment.
** This weakness allows battleships and heavy cruisers to easily deal with these installation types.

'''Hard Skin'''
* Examples are [[Isolated Island Demon]], [[Artillery Imp]], and [[Summer Harbor Princess]].
* Take more damage from anti-installation equipment like [[:Category:Landing Craft|landing crafts]], [[:Category:Amphibious Tank|amphibious tanks]], [[:Category:Anti-Ground Rocket|anti-ground rockets]], and [[:Category:Mortars|mortars]].

=Damage Bonuses=

Please see [[Damage_Calculations#Anti-Installation_Attacks|Damage Calculations]] for more details on how anti-installation damage is calculated.

* During day, damage is capped at 220 so any ship with a proper anti-installation setup will be able to hit the cap.
** When facing hard-skinned installations, it is better for battleships to have AP shells instead of Type 3 because they will hit the day cap anyway.
* Anti-installation is very important during night battle when the cap is raised to 360.
* Torpedo stat is always counted as 0 when attacking installations. This applies to both airstrikes and night battles.
* [[Supply Depot Princess]] is the only known installation that takes post-cap damage from anti-installation equipment.
** This makes her vulnerable to getting one shot by nuke setups. See [[#Equipment Setups|below]] for details.
* Pairing rockets or mortars give better multipliers than using them individually. Eg. WG/WG instead of WG/T4.
* While dive bombers have a post-cap bonus during the air-strike, the low base damage means it is of limited effectiveness against high armor installations.

=Equipment Setups=
Below are recommended equipment setups for anti-installation. If a setup is not listed, it means that it is subpar and not worth considering. The order of the equipment is for illustrative purposes only. It '''does not''' matter what order the equipment are in.

!style="width:40%;"| '''Equipment Setup'''
!style="width:60%;"| '''Notes'''
|- 
|{{RedGunHeavy}}{{RedGunHeavy}}{{Seaplane}}{{RedAmmo}}
|This setup is the basic setup for battleships. Because battleships can hit the damage cap easily, they do not benefit much from anti-installation equipment. The standard artillery spotting setup will allow them to be effective against all other targets including the installation. 
|-
|{{RedGunHeavy}}{{RedGunHeavy}}{{Seaplane}}{{GreenAmmo}}
|This is an option where you will be facing soft-skinned installations. Taking a Type 3 shell will limit the battleship's effectiveness against all other targets. Careful consideration must be made into whether it is worth it.
|-
|{{RedGunHeavy}}{{RedGunHeavy}}{{Seaplane}}{{LandingCraft}}'''/'''{{Amphibious Tank}}
|An alternative setup for [[Nagato|Nagato Kai Ni]] and [[Mutsu|Mutsu Kai Ni]]. The landing craft/amphibious tank will make their Touch attacks deal significant damage to installation enemies. Keeping the seaplane, allows them to perform artillery spotting to maintain some effectivenes against other targets.
|-
|{{RedGunHeavy}}{{RedGunHeavy}}{{Seaplane}}{{GreenAmmo}}{{RedAmmo}}
|This is a unique setup available to [[Musashi|Musashi Kai Ni]] that allows her to have the best of both worlds.

|-
!style="width:40%;"| '''Equipment Setup'''
!style="width:60%;"| '''Notes'''
|- 
|{{RedGunMedium}}{{RedGunMedium}}{{Seaplane}}{{GreenAmmo}}
|This is the standard anti-installation setup for all heavy cruisers. It allows them to artillery spot and deals decent damage against installations.
|-
|{{RedGunMedium}}{{RedGunMedium}}{{AntiGroundArtillery}}{{GreenAmmo}}
|This is an alternative setup only for '''aviation cruisers'''. It removes the ability to artillery spot for much more powerful anti-installation damage at night. 
|-
!colspan="2"| Light Cruisers
|-
!style="width:40%;"| '''Equipment Setup'''
!style="width:60%;"| '''Notes'''
|- 
|{{LandingCraft}}{{Amphibious Tank}}{{AntiGroundArtillery}}
|This is the standard "nuke" setup. It has powerful anti-installation power against all installations but is hampered by the daytime damage cap. It performs best at night or when up against [[Supply Depot Princess]].
|-
|{{RedGunMedium}}{{RedGunMedium}}{{AntiGroundArtillery}}{{AntiGroundArtillery}}
|An alternative setup for 4-slot light cruisers. This preserves their ability to double attack at night while giving them significant anti-installation power.

|- 
|{{LandingCraft}}{{Amphibious Tank}}{{AntiGroundArtillery}}
|Same as the "nuke" setup used by light cruisers. It has powerful anti-installation power against all installations but is hampered by the daytime damage cap. It performs best at night or when up against [[Supply Depot Princess]].
|-
|{{RedGunLight}}{{RedGunLight}}{{LandingCraft}}'''/'''{{Amphibious Tank}}
|This is an alternative setup that preserves their ability to double attack at night while maintaining decent anti-installation power. This setup works best if the Landing Craft or Amphibious Tanks are upgraded to maximise damage. It also allows them to perform well against non-installation targets at night.
|-
|{{LandingCraft}}'''/'''{{Amphibious Tank}}{{AntiGroundArtillery}}{{AntiGroundArtillery}}
|An alternative "nuke" setup if you are lacking Landing Craft or Amphibious Tanks. It will still deal significant damage to [[Supply Depot Princess]].
|-
|{{RedGunLight}}{{RedGunLight}}{{AntiGroundArtillery}}{{AntiGroundArtillery}}
|This setup is currently unique to [[Tashkent]]. It functions much like the light cruiser setup with a powerful night battle double attack.

|-
!style="width:40%;"| '''Equipment Setup'''

|- 
|{{RedPlane}}{{BluePlane}}{{GreenPlane}}{{GreenPlane}}
|This is only to be used if you have one of the [[:Category:Anti-Installation Dive Bomber|anti-installation dive bombers]]. It will allow the carrier to still perform CVCI against other targets.
|-
|{{BluePlane}}{{BluePlane}}{{GreenPlane}}{{GreenPlane}}
|The numbers of torpedo bombers and fighters in this setup can be varied depending on the amount of fighter power required. This is the standard carrier anti-installation setup. While it does sacrifice CVCI, the carrier shelling formula and proficiency bonuses still ensures that carriers will do significant damage to installations and other targets.

|{{LandingCraft}}{{Amphibious Tank}}{{AntiGroundArtillery}}{{WildCard}}
|Same "nuke" setup used by light cruisers. For 4-slot AVs, they can either take a 2nd anti-ground rocket or a seaplane fighter as the wild card. It has powerful anti-installation power against all installations but is hampered by the daytime damage cap. It performs best at night or when up against [[Supply Depot Princess]].
