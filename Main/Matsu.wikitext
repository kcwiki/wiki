|translation = I'm the 1st of the Type-D destroyers, the Matsu-class, Matsu! As part of the last mass-produced destroyer class, I had many little sisters built. In the rush of emergency wartime production, our survivability was boosted by a change in our engine layout<ref>The Matsu-class were the only Japanese vessels to be laid out fire room - engine room - fire room - engine room without cross connections between the sides of the two systems, eliminating a single point of failure. This is similar to the "unit system of machinery" layout.</ref>, and we were equipped with weapons focused on anti-air and anti-submarine warfare! Ueh? Did you call us a mixed forest<ref>Each ship of the Matsu-class is named after a different kind of tree.</ref>!? What are you talking about! Just leave things to me!
