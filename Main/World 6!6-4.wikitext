===Tips===
'''Requires destroying the [[Isolated Island Princess]] 5 times to clear.'''
<br/>
This map features '''multiple starting zone positions''' which were introduced in the [[Winter 2016 Event]].
*Fleet consisting of a Torpedo Squadron (i.e. mostly DDs or CL and DDs) will start on left side of the map
*Existence of any carrier will start on the east, as will any two battleships, or three CA(V)s (Obviously [[Nagato]] and [[Mutsu]] Kai Ni is the exception)
*Not having two destroyers will also start on the west
*You cannot bring no more than 2 CV(L)(B)
*You cannot bring more than 2 (F)BB
<br/>'''Regarding Boss Fleet'''
*Boss Fleet is heavily effected based on your HQ level.
**Admirals below HQ level 103 will not feature a 6-enemy composition in the boss composition outside of the last kill, but will have a chance of appearing if your HQ level is '''103 or higher'''.
**Admirals below HQ level 113 have a chance of rolling a 5-enemy composition with the Late Model DDs (This is the easiest comp). But once your HQ is '''113 or higher''', this composition will disappear completely and can no longer be rolled.
*Boss fleet's flagship is the [[Isolated Island Princess]]
**Isolated Hime will usually have [[Battery Imp]]s and [[Supply Depot Princess]] with her.
**Dev tweet says [[Battery Imp]]s are immune to [[Type 3 Shell]]s but there are many reports of CAs and BBs doing high damage to them in yasen.
**Using [[WG42]] and [[Daihatsu]] will do decent damage to them.
**If you have enough [[WG42]] then you may want to use [[Ooyodo]] or [[Gotland]] and equip her with 2 of them as they stack and can deliver severe damage and can easily one shot an Imp or one of the Hime.
**Stacking [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank]] and [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tanks & Marines)]] upgraded with [[WG42]] can do a lot of damage to [[Supply Depot Princess]] and [[Battery Imp]].
<br/>'''Regarding [[Land-Based Air Squadron]]s'''
*You are permitted to use 1 [[Land-Based Air Squadron]]. There are no air raids on this map.
*Upon completing the quest B80 and F43, you will earn a Construction Team to gain access to your [[Land-Based Air Squadron]], which is '''highly recommended''' to help simplify the battle on the boss node for this map.
*It's recommended to bring 2 Land Based Bombers and 2 Fighters if you have access to your [[LBAS]].
**3 Land Based Bombers and 1 Fighters is an alternative recommendation, if you want to have a better shot at damaging the installations, but may result in your losing planes more and also will likely lose your Land Based Attack Bombers' expertise in the process.
**Another alternative is to bring 4 Land Based Bombers and focus them on C node instead of the boss node.  Plane loss here is minimal.  This can significantly improve the pass rate of an [[Akitsushima]] / [[Nagato]] Kai Ni fleet which emphasizes anti-installation over anti-ship performance.
*The Distance your Land Based Planes can travel on this map is calculated from Start Point 1 and heading eastward each node.
*Bring planes with a distance of 5 or more in order for this to support an attack on the boss node.
*If your Land Based planes focus on targeting the [[Artillery Imp]]s and [[Supply Depot Princess]], the battle will be significantly easier.
*This map can also serve as a good location to train your Land Based attack planes to max expertise. Bring only Land Based Attackers with a distances of 8 or more as they will reach enough distance to allow you to use Maruyu solo on the submarine node on Node M which your planes should target in order to train them.
<br/>'''Recommended Fleet'''
*'''1 CL flagship, 1 (F)BB, 3 DD, 1 CAV / 1 (F)BB, 4 DD, 1 CAV / [[Nagato]] Kai Ni, [[Mutsu]] Kai Ni, 4 DD / 1 CL flagship, [[Nagato]] Kai Ni, [[Mutsu]] Kai Ni, 3 DD''' routes '''B-D-C-F-N'''
**Gives the shortest and easiest route to boss, '''but requires Fast fleet''', this means if you are using slow BB, you have to speed them up by the help of Turbine + Boiler Synergy.
**Highly recommended only if you have enough [[WG42]]s, [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tanks & Marines)]] and [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank]] and had constructed a Seaplane Fighter.
**Fleet has the best chance of reaching the boss node while maintaining fuel and ammo to allow for a better outcome in the boss fight.
** It's highly recommended to have a seaplane fighter or an Italian ship to help aid you in maintaining air superiority / air parity over the fights on your way to the boss. However, if you have her, Ise Kai Ni can pretty much guarantee air superiority, and even give a good chance for air supremacy at the boss when combined with the aforementioned (and still have two free slots after making fast, if given the RE slot).
**DDs and CLs are recommended to have [[WG42]]s and [[Daihatsu]] as these are the only effective ways to do damage to the [[Battery Imp]]s and do decent chipping damage to the [[Isolated Island Princess]], CAs and BBs should be armed with a [[Type 3 Shell]] against the installation bosses. BBs may also bring AP shells to help aid in doing daytime battle damage.
*'''1 BB(V), 1 CAV, 1CL, 2 DD, and [[Akitsushima]] / [[Nagato]] Kai Ni, [[Mutsu]] Kai Ni, 1 CAV, 2 DD, [[Akitsushima]] / [[Nagato]] Kai Ni, [[Mutsu]] Kai Ni, 1 CL, 2 DD, [[Akitsushima]]''' routes '''A-D-C-F-N'''
**[[Akitsushima]] allows for the shortest possible path on the west entrance going from A,D,C,F and N.
**In this case Akitsushima should be armed with at least 2 seaplane fighters as her role will serve to be a distraction and to maintain a degree of air superiority at the boss node depending on the formation.
*'''2 CAV, 1CL, and 3 DD''' routes '''A-D-C-F-N'''
**More powerful set up in compared to [[Akitsushima]] fleet but will require some luck to ensure you'll deliver damage.
