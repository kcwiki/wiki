The event will take place in the '''West''' and is a hypothetical '''"What If" Operation'''. The event will be a '''Large-Scale Event'''.

As of current, details regarding the upcoming event note that note that there will be a '''large and diverse variety''' of new ship girls which will be introduced within this event which includes '''Submarines, Destroyers, Aircraft Carriers and Battleships''' along with '''several recent rare foreign kanmusu from Britain, France, and Italy''' as well as a slew of foreign ships which will be returning as drops over the course of the event. The total number of maps invovled in this event will include '''4 Main Stage Operations''' and '''3 Extra Operations''', overall making '''7 Event Maps''' in total.

#September's Comptiq Magazine revealed that some foreign ships can be farmed multiple times, while others are restricted drops. 
#Dev Tweets have noted that [[Yamakaze]] will be obtainable as a drop on E-1.

===New Equipment===
June's Rank Rewards revealed two planes which served as a hint regarding about one of the ships appearing in the upcoming event.

#[[Swordfish]]
#[[Swordfish Mk. II (Skilled)]]

===New Enemy Vessels===

===New Enemy Equipment===

==Mechanics==
===Participation requirements===
*Must have a 75% sortie win ratio.
*Must have 5 empty ship slots for new ships.
*Must have 20 free equipment slots.

===Special Mechanics===
#The difficulty system first used in [[Spring 2015 Event]] returns: you can choose between Operation A ({{lang|ja|甲}}, Hard), Operation B ({{lang|ja|乙}}, Medium) or Operation C ({{lang|ja|丙}}, Easy).
#*Choosing A or B requires certain HQ Level (HQ Lv 35 for B / 80 for A in Spring 2015 Event).
#*'''An important note''' to all Admirals intending to clear the event on Hard difficulty - further (new) conditions now apply:'''
#**When switching difficulty from ''any other difficulty'' to Hard, the map's debuff mechanism (where applicable) will be reset.
#***Switching between any other difficulties will not reset the debuff mechanism.
#The debuff system from [[Summer 2015 Event]]'s final map, where certain nodes had to be killed to reduce boss armor will return.

'''Recommended Fleet:''' 1 BBV, 1CL, 1CVL, 2-3 DD, 0-1 DE <br>
'''Path:''' I -> J -> G -> D -> P 

A healthy balance of Surface Combat and ASW equipment is recommended. Although the boss is a Submarine, Nodes '''G''' and '''D''' along the way will have fleets consisting of DDs, CLs, CAs, and CLTs. You may want your BBV and CVL (and perhaps the CL) armed to deal with surface ships, while the rest of your ships carry ASW gear, preferably to the point that they can use Opening ASW.

'''Dealing with the [[New Submarine Princess]]'''

*The [[New Submarine Princess]] has a large amount of HP, but is vulnerable to ASW gear. Having a set of Sonars, Depth Charge Launchers and Depth Charges is recommended to maximize your damage output.
*The [[New Submarine Princess]] can come accompanied with a [[Light Carrier Nu-Class|Nu-class Light Carrier or Kai variant]] along with some DDs and other subs.
* A proper fleet should be able to take out the Princess with ASW during day battle, and finish off any surviving DDs and CVLs at night.

'''Going to Node S for [[Sagiri]]'''

*The new Ayanami-class destroyer [[Sagiri]] drops from Node S, but Node S is not available when you first enter the E-1 map.
*#First, you must visit the resource Node M. You can do this with the same 1BBV + 1CVL + CLs/DDs/Escorts fleet you use to attack the boss. Just choose to go north instead of south from the starting node I.
*#Visiting Node M will unlock Node Q, which you must then visit. Getting to Node Q requires an all-fast fleet with no BBVs or CVLs. CAVs are allowed.
*#Visiting Node Q will unlock Nodes R and S. Node R can be reached with the same fleet you used to visit Node Q.
*Nodes R and S are populated by [[PT Imp Group]]s, who are good at dodging shelling attacks. A ship equipped with two small caliber guns and either a [[List of Anti-Air Guns by stats|Machine Gun]] or [[Skilled Lookouts]] will be able to hit the Imps reliably despite their evasion.

'''Unlock Locking path to bypass Node K''' - 3 CV/CVL, 1 CL, 2DD 
*Fleet will travel D -> E -> G -> I
*Node I features the [[Summer Harbor Princess]] along with a batch of DDs (Can also have [[Artillery Imp]]s as well) 
*Score an '''A rank''' is needed to unlock the new path node that goes from L -> O

'''Boss Killing Fleet''' - 1FBB, 2CV, 1 CA, 2DD
*A good strong fleet for doing decent damage and gaining air control along the path.
*However, will be forced to go to Node K which can be run your fuel down to a very low point making it hard to evade.

''Alternative Boss Fleet'' - 1FBB, 1CV, 1CVL, 1CL, 2DD
* While not as strong as previous mentioned fleet, it can help you reach the Boss node via path from L -> O without engaging the Sub Node resulting in having more fuel which will mean having additional evasion.
* Using a pre-emptive launching CL like [[Yura| Yura Kai Ni]] or [[Abukuma|Abukuma Kai Ni]] may be recommended to help pick off weaker enemy ships.

'''Dealing with the [[Heavy Cruiser Ne-Class|Ne-Class Flagship]]'''

The [[Heavy Cruiser Ne-Class|Ne-Class Flagship]] will be in a combined fleet consisting of mainly destroyers with 1 CL and 1 CVL depending on the difficulty. 

It should be noted the Ne-class Heavy Cruiser Flagship has a very large amount of HP, is very strong in combat, and has the ability to launch Abyssal Falcon Planes in the opening stages of battle. (Think of it as like a CAV of sorts.)

Since the enemy fleet consists of mainly DDs, it should be possible to take out most of the ships without worry. However, in the final kill on harder difficulties, one should prepare for an encounter with the [[Old Destroyer Princess]], which has the ability to launch a pre-emptive torpedo strike at the start of battle. Most of the other ships in the combined fleet should be the same as before, and if you are able to deliver a strong amount of damage to the Ne-class Heavy Cruiser Flagship, it should go down without issue. 

Bring Support Fleets for the Boss node and In-route if there are any difficulties along the way.

'''Transport Phase'''

The advice below is written for Hard difficulty. Adjust your expectations accordingly.

Fleet(s) will travel A -> C -> D -> E -> H / F -> I -> K -> L.

'''Transport Fleet:''' 1 LHA / Taiyou, 1 CAV, 4 DD; '''Escort Fleet:''' 1 CL 3 DD 2 CA

*[[Taiyou]] or [[Akitsu Maru]] is recommended due to how difficult it is to obtain even just Air Parity in this map en route to the boss node (the boss node itself has 0 FP).
**While there is another Transport Phase in E6, that map also offers access to LBAS, and has no FP requirements other than at the boss node itself.
**However, plan your shiplocks carefully - the Transport Phase in E6 requires anti-installation equipment and ships for its boss node, as well as ships that are capable of equipping Daihatsu or other transport equipment (E6 has a total TP bar of '''2000''' on Hard). Take this into account when deciding which ships to sortie to E3.
*Using either of the above ships requires the use of an '''[[Improved Steam Turbine]]''' and a '''Boiler''' in order to increase their speed from Slow to Fast. Otherwise, the fleet will have to go through additional nodes on Hard. (Refer to the Branching Rules above for details.)
**This Slow speed penalty does '''not''' apply to easier difficulties.
**Taiyou has 4 slots from her Kai form onwards. This allows her to equip both pieces of equipment without requiring the use of a Reinforcement Expansion, while still contributing significantly to FP.
**Akitsu Maru Kai only has 3 slots, all of which are smaller than Taiyou's largest slots. Depending on how much FP you can squeeze out of your CAV, you may or may not want to use a Reinforcement Expansion to reduce the number of slots taken up by engine equipment.
**However, she does contribute as an LHA to depleting the TP bar, while Taiyou does not.
**Finally, while you should '''not''' expect your Main Transport Fleet to contribute much during combat (if at all), note that Akitsu Maru is still capable of attacking even with only fighters equipped, while Taiyou is not.

Alternatively, 2 CAVs may be used instead.

(i.e. '''Transport Fleet:''' 2 CAV, 4 DD; '''Escort Fleet:''' 1 CL 3 DD 2 CA)

*However, depending on how many Seaplane Fighters you have (as well as how high/low their Fighter Power is), you may find it more difficult to obtain Air Parity.
**Use of Seaplane Bombers to contribute to FP should be '''avoided''', as they are highly likely to get wiped along the way due to the small slot sizes on most CAVs.
*Nevertheless, CAVs are relatively more resilient than the above ships, and have better firepower (assuming they hit anything).

Finally, BBVs may be used instead of Akitsu Maru / Taiyou / CAVs (if you ''really'' have no other options, for whatever reasons). Again, however, engine equipment will be necessary to increase their speed to Fast if they are Slow. Otherwise, the fleet will still have to go through additional nodes on Hard.

*Once again, the speed penalty does '''not''' apply to easier difficulties.

AACI is recommended. Depending on how many Akizuki-class DDs you have, you may wish to conserve them for later maps; if this is the case, a generic DD AACI set-up should suffice. If unsure, wait for more information to be released before committing to a decision.

Both support expeditions are also recommended.

| Notes = 198/396 for AS/AS+ at boss; Due to the high number of air nodes, a healthy buffer is recommended

'''Boss Phase'''

The advice below is written for Hard difficulty. Adjust your expectations accordingly.

'''Carrier Task Force:'''

'''Main Fleet:''' 1 Kongou-Class FBB, 2 CV (Hiryuu & Souryuu), 3 CA(V); '''Escort Fleet:''' 2 CA, 1 CL, 0-1 CLT, 2-3 DD.

Fleet(s) will travel A -> C -> D -> E -> H -> M / N -> Q.
*As of this time, the routing from H -> M / N appears to be random. This page will be updated if and when a workaround is discovered.
**While Node M is tougher than Node N, it is still survivable, and the fleet will proceed to the boss node afterwards.
*CLTs suffer from a branching penalty in the second half of E-4, and are only really necessary in the second half of E-6 (E-7 has no shiplock). If you are having difficulty at the boss node - and have enough CLTs to spare - it may be useful to bring one along to this phase of the map.
*You may wish to bring CAVs instead of CAs in your Main Fleet in order to provide supplementary Fighter Power.
*Once again, AACI and both support expeditions are recommended.

'''Main Fleet:''' 1 Kongou-Class FBB, 2 CV (Hiryuu & Souryuu), 1CVL, 2 CA(V); '''Escort Fleet:''' 2 CA, 1 CL, 0-1 CLT, 2-3 DD.

Fleet(s) will travel the same route as above, but '''have a chance to off-route to both nodes M and N''' before reaching the boss node. Use at your own risk.

Whether or not this is affected by the presence of enough "historical" ships has yet to be determined.

'''Surface Task Force:'''

Pending Write-Up (assuming this is viable).

Planning this map will require you to plan your fleet out well in advance since you'll be killing two enemy units on this map. Whenever possible, try to use as much of the fleet in the first fight for the second fight. Do note however that slow ships can work on this map so try to make use of them as you can.

'''First Kill Phase'''

'''Recommended Fleet:'''<br>
'''Carrier Task Force: 2 BB, 2 CA, 2CVL + 1 CL, 2 CA, 3 DD''' 

Path: A -> B -> C -> G -> H -> I

CTF is recommended as it'll help you avoid '''Node D''' (which has submarines) for this part of the operation. Most enemies along the route will consist of torpedo squadrons and a group of Nu-class light Carriers Kai which may be manageable, however the biggest issue will generally come at Node C where you'll face a Battleship Squadron which you may want a [[Land-Based Air Squadron]] for to help wipe out some of the units there. 

Boss node itself will features a [[Summer Aircraft Carrier Demon]] along with a combined fleet of various ships. Using the help of your [[Land-Based Air Squadron]] and Boss support Fleet is recommended to make short work of the Carrier Boss. 

'''[[LBAS]] Recommendations:'''

1 Fighters/ Land Base Fighter + 3 Land Based Bombers / Torpedo Bombers

The distance required to reach node C and I is very short (a distance of '''3'''), so you're welcome to load up your more powerful bombers in there if needed to whip out any enemy units. If you happen to have Land Based bombers, use them in thier place as they're more preferred. 

'''Dealing with the [[Summer Aircraft Carrier Demon]]'''

As mentioned above, a  [[Land-Based Air Squadron]] and Boss support is recommended to take care of most of the enemy units in battle. In addition, while it may be possible to fight the [[Summer Aircraft Carrier Demon]]'s fleet using only your light Carries are part of your main fleet units, you may need to set up Standard Carriers for the final kill to help gain Air superiority over her.

'''Second Kill Phase'''

'''Recommended Fleet:'''<br>
'''Surface Task Force: 2 BB, 2 CA, 2CVL + 1 CL, 2 CA, 2 DD, 1 CLT'''<br>
'''Recommended European Ships:''' 1 for Easy / 2 for Normal / 3 for Hard

'''Surface Task Force without European Ship: 2 BB, 2 CA, 2CVL + 1 CL, 2 CA, 3 DD'''<br>
Path: D -> G -> H -> J -> K -> M -> N

In this part, your fleet will be traveling up the Suez Canal to battle against the '''[[French Battleship Princess]]''' along the way, expect to be dealing with [[PT Imp Group]]s (AA based guns recommended), and a mixture of strong surface ships with PT Imps. Upon passing these you'll face off against the [[French Battleship Princess]] who will be in a combined fleet featuring 1 Carrier, 2 Battleships, and a set of DDs, and light cruisers. 

'''[[LBAS]] Recommendations:'''

1 Fighters/ Land Base Fighter + 3 Land Based Bombers / Torpedo Bombers

A distance of '''6''' is needed to reach the boss

'''Dealing with the [[French Battleship Princess]]'''

It has been noted that the boss may possess a vulnerability to certain foreign ships (e.g. [[Prinz Eugen]], [[Warspite]], etc.), granting them firepower or damage bonuses against the boss. The exact mechanisms of this vulnerability are not known as of yet.

}}

This maps consists of battles that will mainly consist of fighting smaller ships, and going through various air strikes. To ensure the safest path towards the boss node, consider using the following fleet:

'''Recommended Fleet''': 2CV, 2BB, 2 DD (''Fleet must include several '''European ships''' see detail on this below'')

'''Path:''' A -> B ->C/D -> E -> F -> I -> K -> M

Depending on the difficulty, you will need to bring the following number of '''European ships''' in your fleet to meet the requirements to go this path:

*1 '''European ship''' on Easy
*2 '''European ship''' on Normal
*3 '''European ship''' on Hard

'''European Ships'''
* European ships refer to any foreign ship that is not American or Russian
** Regia Marina: Libeccio, Zara-Class, Littorio-Class (Italia included), Aquila
** Marine Nationale: Commandant Teste, Richelieu
** Kriegsmarine: Type 1934 (Z1 and Z3), Prinz Eugen, Bismarck, Graf Zeppelin
** Royal Navy: Warspite

* The following do '''not''' count as european ships
** Gangut, Verniy
** Iowa, Saratoga

* Whether U-511/Ro counts as a foreign ship remains to be investigated

* If you're new and lack in foreign ships, consider training [[Richelieu]] to fill in the European ship requirement (if playing on Easy). As using the European ship fleet requirement is easier to play through the map compared to the alternative.

*In terms of ships to bring, bring a destroyer that is capable Anti-Air Cut in (Especially the Akizuki class to help with the Air Attack nodes)

* If the Submarines of Node A present an issue, consider bringing a DD that has strong ASW and has the ability to do preemptive ASW attacks on the node. Consider [[Libeccio]] if you have her well trained and need her to help assist with the European ship requirements.

'''Alternative Recommended Fleet:''' 1 BBV/FBB, 1 CVL, 1 CL, 3DD

'''Path:''' A -> B ->C/D -> E -> I -> K -> M

Travels the same path as above fleet without the requirements of '''European ships''', but due to the low air power and fire power, it will become very difficulty to deal with most of the battles and Air attack nodes in general. 

All other information from above should be considered.

'''Weakening the Boss Fleet'''

As noted in Ooyodo's mission briefing notes it's possible to cut the enemies defense line (resulting in reducing the boss's fleets defenses). To do so, the following nodes must be completed with the following conditions:

* '''A rank Node C and D on Easy/ Normal'''
* '''S rank Node C and D on Hard'''

* Node C consists of a [[Supply Depot Princess]] along with some [[PT Imp Group]]s use Type3 and AA guns to help take out as many of the enemies there.

* Node D consists of a Light enemys Ships along with some [[PT Imp Group]]s use AA guns to help remove the imps quickly.

If possible, consider using a concentrated LBAS air strike on node C and D to help you win the fights and earn complete the requirements.

If the requirements are met, you will hear a chime which indicates that the boss fleet has been weakened.

'''Dealing with the [[Battleship Summer Princess]]'''

The [[Battleship Summer Princess]] is within a combined fleet that consist of no carriers in battle so bringing a full set of land base bombers is recommended take down as many members of the fleet as possible to that you can focus more on the [[Battleship Summer Princess]].

AP shells are recommended for your battleships to help them deliver a strong blow against the [[Battleship Summer Princess]]

Boss Support is also recommended to help make things easier in the process. 

'''Recommended LBAS Setup'''

'''4 Land Based bombers''' or 3 Torpedo bobmers + Flying Boat

*The Distance needed to reach the boss node is '''8'''. A full set of [[Type 1 Land Attacker]]s should allow you to reach the boss node with no assistance from a flying boat type seaplane. 

*Due to the fact the boss has almost no air power, using this set up should be more than helpful taking out as many of the enemies as possible on the boss node.

'''4 Type 21 fighters'''

* Only consider using if you have issues with the Air attack nodes on F and K, as it'll help improve your chances of surviving those nodes, but will also mean making the boss node slightly more difficulty to beat.

The following maps consists of two phases which you need to complete in order to successfully to the final operation. These phases are a '''Transportation Phase''' and a '''Kill Phase'''.

'''Transportation Phase'''

The '''Transportation phase''' is a short, but relatively tough run through some battles consisting of  PT imps and a battleship fleet till you enemy harbor which you must successfully score an A or S rank in order deplete a TP gauge. Note that the TP gauge on this map is long and it will take time to deplete. To help speed up the process, consider bringing in [[Daihatsu]] if you have any. 

'''Recommended Composition'''

'''Transport Combine Fleet'''
1 BBV, 1CAV/LAH, 4 DD + 1 CL, 2CA, 3DD

'''Path:'''A -> B -> D -> F -> H

*Have your BBV armed with thier typical combat set up along with a Zuiun and a seaplane fighter to help aid in air combat. If you consider bringing a CAV do the same with them. If you bring an LAH such as [[Akitsu Maru]], consider arming her with fighters to help gain a stronger aerial advantage by the time you reach the boss node. 
*DDs in the main fleet should be armed with as many drums / Daihatsu (which Daihatsu should take priority over the drums) as possible.
*Escort Fleet should be armed for combat and should use Type 3 shells and WG42s if you have any. 

Land Base Air Squadron should be planned to be carefully divided up to assist with Node D and the boss node in the process. 


'''Carrier Combine Fleet'''<br>
2CV, 4 DD + 1 CL, 2CA, 3DD

'''Path:''' A -> B -> D -> F -> H

*CVs should be armed with a 2 torpedo bombers / 2 fighters set up to help aid in take out some of the enemy's units especially in Node D.
*DDs in the main fleet should be armed with as many drums / Daihatsu (which Daihatsu should take priority over the drums) as possible.
*Escort Fleet should be armed for combat and should use Type 3 shells and WG42s if you have any and possible an AA gun to deal with imps. 

This fleet is easier to manage and will more likely reach the boss node with far less difficulty. However due to the lack of transports related ships it'll have, the TP gauge will likely not drain nearly as quickly as it would in a Transport Combined Fleet.

This composition however with the assistance of In-route and Boss support more than likely help you score an S rank on the boss depleting the gauge far more easier. 

Both Compositions should consider using In route and boss support fleets, as they are recommended since you will have a need as much assistance on Node D and the boss node. 

'''[[LBAS]] Recommendation for Transport Phase'''

'''Squadron 1'''<br>
2 Land Based Fighters / Fighters, 2 Land Based Bombers / Torpedo Bombers

'''Squadron 2'''<br>
4 Land Based Bombers / Torpedo Bombers 

Since the distance to the boss node is relatively short '''(Distance of 3)''' , you can use your most powerful interceptors or fighters for this part of the phase as they should be able to do more air assistance compared to the usual set up.

'''Squadron 1''' on should be considered for targeting entirely on the boss node to wipe out some enemy planes as well as some enemy units while '''Squadron 2''' can be used with either the boss node, or split between the boss node and Node D. 

Since Node D lacks lacks in much air defense, your planes shouldn't suffer a loss from that fight. 

'''Dealing with the [[Harbour Summer Princess]]'''

If you use the following advice that is mentioned above (particularly with a Carrier Task Force) you Land Base Air Squadron should be able to wipe out most of the enemy fleets in the combine fleet. And mostly leave a few if any survivors remaining outside of the princess herself in the combined fleet.

Since the fleet will consist of imps, make sure to have a AA gun of some kind on your ship in order to take them out and with your type 3 shells and WG42s you should eventually either beat down the [[Harbour Summer Princess]] of defeat her with little effort. 

Once the TP Gauge has been depleted, you can then proceed on to the kill phase.

'''Kill Phase'''

Kill phase will involve your fleet having to fight the [[Summer Aircraft Carrier Princess]]. You will need to go through a series of carrier battles and submarines fights before reaching her, but in addition to these there is a way to weaken the boss fleet so they can become more vulnerable to attacks. The following information below consist of how to debuff the boss first followed by taking her down.

In addition, '''LBAS''' has a distance of '''0''' on all the western parts of the map making it possible to use your strongest bombers and fighters where every you want in that area.

'''Weakening the Boss Fleet'''

This boss fleet has an '''Armor Reduction''' Mechanic just like the prior boss and requires you do to two things:

*Score an A or S on Node H (Post Transport Phase)
*Score an S on Node O

Once the conditions are complete you will hear a ding sound at the base indicating you have successfully completed the debuff.

'''Going to Node H'''

Since the requirements needed for the debuff only occur after transport phase, you will need to return to the [[Harbour Summer Princess]] once more to score an A or S rank on her node. Repeat the same process as mentioned above in the transport phase to score an A or S rank.

'''Going to Node O'''

'''Recommended Composition'''

'''Carrier Task Force'''<br>
3-4 CV, 1-2CA 1-2(F)BB(V) + 1 CL, 2CA, 3DD

'''Path:''' K -> J -> L -> O

To go up this path, you will need a fleet consisting of several large ships or a fleet that has at least 4 Large Ships and a slow ship to go up this path. So consider bringing a BBV or BB to meet the requirements.

You may want to consider possible air support along the way from your LBAS and Support fleet as you make your way to Node O. However, concentrate attacks on Node O to help gain an easy victory. 


'''[[LBAS]] Recommendation for Kill Phase against the boss'''

'''Squadron 1'''<br>
2 Land Based Fighters / Fighters, 2 Land Based Bombers / Torpedo Bombers

'''Squadron 2'''<br>
1 Land Based Fighter / Fighter , 3 Land Based Bombers / Torpedo Bombers 

Concentrate all attacks on the Boss node. As you'll need to weaken her air power and take out enemies in the fleet. You can bring your best planes here as you can use them here with no punishment on distance. 

'''Dealing with the Summer Carrier Princess'''

'''Recommended Composition'''

'''Carrier Task Force'''<br>
3 CV(B), 3CA(V) + 1 CL, 2CA 1CLT , 2DD

3 CV(B), 2CAV, 1 CA + 1 CL, 3CLT , 2DD

The boss Fleet will consist of a [[Summer Aircraft Carrier Princess]] along with additional carriers and some stronger ships such as BBs and CAs in the main fleet, while the escort fleet will consist of smaller ships. 

By concentrating your [[LBAS]] to attack the boss node, you should be able to easily take out most of the enemy fleet without much effort. Use boss support if you need to try to help make things quicker and easier. 

If you have managed to complete the debuff requirements, the [[Summer Aircraft Carrier Princess]] and her boss fleet will become more vulnerable to all attacks, making it quite possible to take her down easily during day battle. 

If done correctly, you should be able to easily defeat the fleet up to the final kill.

With the final kill, with a little bit of luck you should be able to still repeat the same process with little effort. 

If you need a little extra help with taking out more enemies, considering bring extra CLT (unless you have plans to use them in earlier maps for farming or have used them in earlier maps)

If you do not manage to beat the [[Summer Aircraft Carrier Princess]] in day battle, depend on a torpedo cut-in to finish her off.

Dealing with the final operation will involve your fleet having to deal with a constant gauntlet of Princess type abyssals through almost every node which you will have to go through and as noted by Ooyodo, will involve going through a large series of battles which will involve taking out an enemy harbor, a supply line, and a series of subs.

As noted in Ooyodo’s notes, your objective will be to:

* '''Destroy an Enemy Harbor''' - '''Node P (Score an A Rank)'''
* '''Destroy an Enemy Supply Line''' - '''Node R (Score an S rank)'''
* '''Suppress the Enemy Submarines''' - '''Nodes H, J, K (Score S Rank on each  [Hard Mode Only])'''

Completing this will '''unlock a shortcut''' path for your fleet to advance more easily to the boss.

Each of these segment will involve organizing your fleet in a particular way, setting up equipment designated to complete each of the tasks, and setting up your LBAS to attack the specific nodes so your fleet can tackle the objectives.

Due to the complexity of this event map, there are many approaches to how to go about playing the map, below are only a few options that have been done that have resulted in success. 

Please feel free to experiment with other compositions, if you have composition that work for you, feel free to report them.

'''Taking out the Enemy Harbor (Node P)'''

'''Recommended Fleet Composition:''' 

'''Surface Task Force:'''
3 FBB, 2 CL, 1 CV(B) + 2 CA, 1 CLT, 1 CL, 2 DD 

'''Path:''' C ->G ->H ->O ->L ->P

4 FBB/ BB , 1 CL, 1 CV(B) + 2 CA, 1 CLT, 1 CL, 2 DD 

'''Path:''' C ->G ->D ->F ->H ->O ->L ->P

Heavier Fleet that will go the long path, but will present a stronger firepower for the boss node.

Fleet should be organized to perform combat mostly in the main fleet. Depending on who you bring, consider bring a mixture of combat capable ships, ASW capable ships a ship with AACI capabilities and some ships armed with AA guns/ [[Skilled Lookouts]]. 

To summarize on one possible way to set up your fleet. Here is one way to consider organize your fleet.

'''Main Fleet: '''

FBB  - 2 main guns + Seaplane + Type 3 Shells <br>
CV(B) - 2-3 Fighters and 1-2 Torpedo Bombers<br>
CL #1 - If you have Yura Kai Ni or Kinu Kai Ni, consider an AACI set up or set them up with loads of Seaplane fighters. Or if Submarines are the bigger concern, use ASW gear to free up other's equipment to help manage taking out imps. <br>
CL #2 - ASW set up to take out enemy subs<br>

'''Escort Fleet: '''

CA - 2 Main Guns + Seaplane + Type 3 Shells<br>
CLT - Midget Sub + 2 Yellow / Red Guns<br>
CL - Midget sub (if Abukuma Kai Ni) or Seaplane + 2 Main guns<br>
DD - ASW set up (arm with AA guns/ skilled lookouts to help take out imps is possible)

Do consider bringing an Fleet Command Facility for your Flagship.

'''LBAS Recommendations (For Node P run):'''

'''Land Base Air Squadron #1 '''

4 Land Base Fighters / Fighters

* Consider all attacks to be placed entirely on Node L or partially on Node L and P.
* Air defense is especially needed for Node L due to the high plane power the enemy bases will have that they may use to attack your fleet, thus Eliminating as many of the bombers will help improve your chances of survival on Node L.
* You can use this to help cripple Node P’s air power as they will have a Summer Harbor Princess and a possibly other installations that can use bombers as well.

'''Land Base Air Squadron #2'''

* 0-2 Land Base Fighters / 2-4 Land Based bombers / Torpedo Bombers

* Concentrate all attack on the Node P to reduce air power and do damage against the enemy fleet.

'''Land Base Air Squadron #3'''

* 4 Land Based bombers / Torpedo Bombers

* Concentrate all attack on the Node P to attempt to do damage against the enemy fleet.
* If using a Carrier Task Force, consider Node G as another location to target if it presents some issues.

'''Dealing with the [[Harbour Summer Princess]]:'''

The [[Harbour Summer Princess]] will have a fleet consisting of mostly PT imps, Submarines, a few transport ships and and possibly a supply depot princess. If you have organized you equipment and arranged your LBAS properly you should be able to complete this battle with an A rank or Higher with little issue. It can also be possible to complete the submarine node (H) while doing this at the same time.

'''In-route Support Fleet is highly recommended.'''

'''Destroying the Enemy Supply Line (Node R)'''

'''Recommended Fleet Composition:'''

'''Surface Task Force'''

2-4 FBB/BB, 0-2 CA(V), 1 CV(B),1CL + 1-2 CA, 0-2 CLT 1 CL, 3-5 DD 

(This is dependent on if you’re trying to reach the sub nodes while playing this route.)

4 BB/ FBB, 1 CV(B), 1CL + 1 CL, 1-2CLT, 1 CA, 2-3DD

'''Path:''' C-> A-> B -> E -> (J -> N / I -> K) ->O -> R

Will take you the long path, but will allow you to bring a powerful fleet to node R to help you gain an easier victory.

Most fleet members should be armed for combat, 1CL from the main fleet and 2 DD from the escort fleet should be prepared for ASW combat to help minimize damage from subs.

2 FBB, 2CAV, 1 CV, 1CL + 1 CL, 1-2 CA, 3-4 DD

'''Path:''' C-> A-> E -> (J -> N / I -> K) ->O -> R

Takes a shorter path, can consider arming ships to tackle subs as well in route.

Most fleet members should be armed for combat, 1CL from the main fleet and 2 DD from the escort fleet should be prepared for ASW combat to help minimize damage from subs.

Otherwise if you’re planning to kill subs (for hard mode) consider arming as many DDs with ASW gear and have them Pre-ASW capable. 

'''LBAS Recommendations:'''

'''Land Base Air Squadron #1 '''

3-4  Land Base Fighters / Fighters + 0-1 Land Base Bombers / Torpedo Bobmers

*Consider all attacks to be placed entirely on Node E as you will be dealing with attacks a heavy attack against Wo-class Carriers.  Using a surface Task force will require defending your fleet from the air attacks since your air strength will be somewhat weak in a surface Task Force. 

'''Land Base Air Squadron #2 '''

1-2 Land Base Fighters / Fighter 2-3 Land Based bombers / Torpedo Bombers

*Concentrate either all attacks on the Node N to reduce air power and do damage against the enemy fleet. Do divide evenly among N and R to allow for a chance to do extra damage on Node R to help you gain an S rank on Node R.

'''Land Base Air Squadron #3'''

4 Land Based bombers / Torpedo Bombers

*Concentrate all attack on the Node R and do damage against the Supply Line Fleet. 

'''Dealing with the Supply Line Fleet:'''

If you organize your fleet accordingly and make it to Node R. You should be able to take most of the ships with little issue with your LBAS and possibly defeat the enemy fleet while your fleets attack them.

To successfully complete the requirements, you will need to score an S rank on this node.

Prepare to have a strong attack fleet in place in the event a Destroyer Water Demon appears in the flagship position. Otherwise, if the enemy fleet consist of a Nu-class Carrier, it should be manageable. 

'''In-route Support fleet is highly recommended.'''

'''Suppressing the Enemy Submarines: (Required for Hard Mode Only)'''

The Submarine fleets are easy once you reach their location '''(Node H, J, K)''' and have the ASW gear to take them out. You will need to score an S rank on each node.

Keep in mind that getting to Node J and K are random and may require multiple attempts to successfully reach both node. 

As usual, ships with '''Pre-ASW capabilities''' will benefit more in these battles over those that don’t. So if you have any DDs with ASW over 100, consider using them. 

'''Node H''' <br/>
'''Carrier Task Force: '''

1FBB/BB, 3-4CV, 1-2 CL + 1 CL, 1CA, 4DD

'''Path:''' C->G -> D -> F ->H

Surface Task Force:
3 FBB, 2 CL, 1 CV(B) + 1 CL, 0-1 CA 2-5 DD 

'''Path:''' C ->G->H

'''Node J and K'''

'''Surface Task Force: '''

2 FBB, 2CAV, 1 CV, 1CL + 1 CL, 0-1 CA, 4 DD

'''Path: '''C-> A-> E -> (J  / I -> K)

DDs and CL in both fleets should be armed for ASW combat (unless it’s Abukuma Kai Ni who should at least keep her Hiyoteiki or be combat focused.) Everyone else should remain combat focus.

'''LBAS Recommendations:'''

'''Land Base Air Squadron #1 '''

3-4  Land Base Fighters / Fighters + 0-1, Land Base Bombers / Torpedo Bombers for Node G And E

* Depending on the path you take Consider all attacks to be placed entirely on Node E or G as you will be dealing with attacks a heavy attack against Wo-class Carriers to help reduce carrier power.

'''Land Base Air Squadron #2 '''

2 Land Base Fighters / Fighter, 2 Land Based bombers / Torpedo Bombers

* Depending on the path you take Consider all attacks to be placed entirely on Node E or G as you will be dealing with attacks a heavy attack against Wo-class Carriers to help reduce carrier power.

'''Land Base Air Squadron #3'''

4 Land Based bombers / Torpedo Bombers

*Concentrate all attack on the Node G to take out as many of the ships from the Destroyer Princess's Fleet.  

If you have completed all requirements outside of the sub nodes and are on route to node P or R after the shortcut is open, you can '''attempt to go to these nodes work on the “Debuff phase” since it’ll count toward that phase once the path is open. '''

'''Debuffing Phase:'''

Once the path is unlocked, you will need to go to Nodes P and R once more to activate and score a minimum of an A rank to debuff the enemy fleets along nodes Q, T, and U. 

However the path to P has changed and you will need to re-organize a fleet so they can reach Node P.

'''Dealing with the Supply Line Fleet Again:'''

'''Recommended Composition:''' 

'''Surface Task Force: '''

4 BB/ FBB, 1 CV(B), 1CL + 1 CL, 1-2CLT, 1 CA, 2-3DD

Path: C-> A-> B -> E -> (J -> N / I -> K) ->O -> R

'''Alternative Surface Task Force:'''

2 FBB, 2CAV, 1 CV, 1CL + 1 CL, 1-2 CA, 3-4 DD

Path: C-> A-> E -> (J -> N / I -> K) ->O -> R

The process for tackling this fight should be the same as before. Please refer to “Destroying the Enemy Supply Line (Node R)” for more details.

'''Carrier Task Force: (Preferred)'''

1FBB, 4 CV(B), 1 CL+1CL , 1-2 CA, 0-1 CLT, 2 DD

Path: C -> G -> H -> O -> R

With the new path open, you can now take an easier path to node R with less effort needed to reach it. As a result you can concentrate more LBAS on G and R to score an easy victory.

Most fleet members should be combat focus and you may consider having some DD be ASW prepared to help minimize damage from subs. 


'''Land Base Air Squadron #1'''

4 Land Based bombers / Torpedo Bombers

*Concentrate all attack on the Node G to take out as many of the ships from the Destroyer Princesse’s Fleet.  

'''Land Base Air Squadron #2 and #3'''

1 Land Base Fighters / Fighter, 3 Land Based bombers / Torpedo Bombers

*Consider Targeting Node R with these two squadrons to maximize the damage you can deliver upon them. 

'''Taking out the Enemy Harbor (Node P) Again:'''

Unlike before hand, the Harbor Princess node will be harder to reach with the new short cut but with some proper management, you can be able to reach the node without much trouble:

'''Recommended Composition: '''

'''Transport Combined Fleet:'''

Taiyou, 1 CAV, 4DD + 1 CL, 2 CA, 3DD

0-1 LHA, 0-1 BBV, 1-2 CAV, 4 DD + 1 CL, 2 CA, 3DD

'''Path:''' C-> G ->H->L->P

Will make a straight shot to a boss node. Fleet is advised to be armed with mostly for combat while some ships should use various weapons such as Daihatsu, WG42, Type 3 Shells to fight the installations, and AA guns to deal with PT imps.

'''Surface Task Force:'''

1 FBB, 2CVL, 1AV, 2CL + 1 CL, 1 CA, 1 CLT 3 DD
Path: 

'''Path:''' C-> G ->D->H->L->P

A more heavier fleet that will need to travel one extra node. But has a better chance at taking out some of the boss fleet. Again, Fleet is advised to be armed with mostly for combat while some ships should use various weapons such as Daihatsu, WG42, Type 3 Shells to fight the installations, and AA guns to deal with PT imps.

'''Recommended LBAS:'''

'''Land Base Air Squadron #1 '''

2 Land Base Fighters / Fighters, 2 Land Based bombers / Torpedo Bombers
* Consider all attacks to be placed entirely on NodeP since you’ll need to do what damage you can to the enemy Harbor’s fleet and units

'''Land Base Air Squadron #2 '''

0-1 Land Base Fighters / 3-4 Land Based bombers / Torpedo Bombers

* Concentrate all attack on the Node P to reduce air power and do damage against the enemy fleet.

'''Land Base Air Squadron #3'''

4 Land Based bombers / Torpedo Bombers

* Concentrate all attack on the Node G to take out as many of the Enemy’s fleet’s ships. Unless you feel your surface task force can efficently take out the ships on this node. Otherwise focus on Node P.

'''Dealing with the [[Harbour Summer Princess]]:'''

Unlike beforehand, the [[Harbour Summer Princess]] should now be without subs  in her fleet. But will be slightly stronger and have a [[Artillery Imp]] in her fleet. If you use your LBAS and Support fleets accordingly you should be able to take out most of her fleet with little effort. 

Any surviving imps can be picked off with the AA gun/ Skilled Lookouts and per usual, equipment that are generally weak to installations such as the [[Harbour Summer Princess]] should be do high damage against her.

Also bringing your Battleships with [[Type 91 AP Shell]] or [[Type 1 AP Shell]] can help with artillery Imps. 

'''Scoring an A rank''' is needed to meet the requirements to help activate the debuff.

Once Node P and R have both gotten an A rank, you will hear a '''“Ding” sound''' upon returning to your base indicating that you have completed the requirements. 

'''Key Terms'''
LBAA - Land Based Attack Aircraft<br/>
TB - Torpedo Bomber<br/>
Taitei - [[Type 2 Flying Boat]]<br/>
Catalina - [[PBY-5A Catalina]]<br/>

'''Recommended LBAS Setup for Boss Route''' <br/>
Base #1: 4x LBAS or 3x TB + Taitei or Catalina
* The land base must have a range of '''8''' in order to reach node '''T'''.
* [[Type 96 Land Attacker]] will be able to reach the node without assistance, while '''6''' range Torpedo Bomber will be required to reach '''8''' range with a Taitei or Catalina equipped.

Base #2: Taitei/Catalina + 1/2x Fighter + 1/2x LBAA/TB
* The land base must have a range of '''9''' in order to reach node '''U'''.
* A minimum of a [[Type 1 Land Attacker]] will be required to reach the node without assistance.
** [[Type 1 Land Attacker Model 34]] has a base of 8 range.
** Using a Taitei will allow for '''6''' range planes to be used in the land base.
** Using a Cataline will allow for '''7''' range planes to be used in the land base.
** Note: This is useful for mainly hard mode difficulty. For lower level players or those playing on easy or normal consider an all fighter LBAS on Node Q instead.

Base #3: 4x LBAA or Taitei or Catalina + 3x LBAA/TB
* The land base must have a range of '''9''' in order to reach node '''U'''.
* A minimum of a [[Type 1 Land Attacker]] will be required to reach the node without assistance.
** [[Type 1 Land Attacker Model 34]] has a base of 8 range.
Base #3 Alternative: 4x Fighter
* The land base must have a range of '''6''' in order to reach node '''Q'''.
* Attempt to reach at least Air Parity with 4 fighters.
* Two fighter waves should be sent to Q (CV Hime) node in order to reduce fighter power requirements and reduce the number of abyssal bombers.
