==Phase 1: Transport Phase==

During this phase of the operation, you will be depleting a TP gauge (~750 TP on Hard). It is not very difficult, merely tedious (also depending on equipment and/or ships used).

* '''Composition:''' '''1CL/DE,4-5 DD'''
* '''Route: A-B-C-D-G-(H+I/J)-K-L '''
* D and G being Submarine Nodes, H/J light surface engagements and L the transport boss with a Submarine Flagship.
** I is an additional submarine node which you may be routed to depending on fleet composition (see routing rules).
** But it is not a particularly dangerous node and is probably worth taking to reduce the TP gauge more quickly with more ships overall.
* [[Daihatsu]]s and [[Drum Canister]]s help accelerate emptying the TP gauge. Keep in mind that this may take a while depending on the difficulty and you may wish to preserve Daihatsu carrying ships to later event maps.
* One or two OASW Ships are useful for the sub nodes and Boss.

Boss at node L is a Submarine along with a team of destroyers, if you bring the recommended gear, you should be able to pass the node successfully under double line. Repeat until TP gauge is clear.
