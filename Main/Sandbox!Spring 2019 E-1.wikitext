==Soloblast's Proposal==
*Nodes D & L are choice nodes.
*Nodes S & W (boss node) have LoS checks (â‰ˆ 21 Cn1 LoS for boss node?).
*Nodes C, O, Q, S, and W are surface nodes. Most other nodes are sub nodes, choice nodes, or blue nodes.

'''Unlocking The Boss Node:'''
*Reach Nodes G & U
*S-Rank(?) Nodes O & S

*4DE 2DD to reach Node U.
*1CL 2DD 3DE to reach all other required Nodes.

Supports are not necessary. LBAS may help with passing surface nodes if there is any difficulty there.

'''To Boss Node:'''
*Ensure sufficient LoS to pass the LoS check.
*1CL 2DD 3DE will reach the boss node.
*All LBAS to boss node.

==Totaku's Proposal==

E-1 is relatively simple to do on this event even on hard difficulty with a moderately trained fleet. As most of the map will require you to engage against simple surface fleets and submarines. 

A good general recommendation for who to choose for this map if you play on normal or hard difficulty is avoid using fleets affiliated with '''Pearl Harbor''', the <span style="color:Yellow; text-shadow:0px 0px 2px black;">'''2nd Fleeta and Operation Ten-Go Members'''</span>, and '''fleets that made up <span style="color:Blue; text-shadow:0px 0px 2px black;">Operation AL and Northern Forces'''</span>. Most other standard ships that are not key ships and are average in combat are suitable for this map.

'''Objective'''

Over the course of this map you will need to complete a patrolling operation around 4 major key points:

* Patrol around the Stugaru Strait and reach the base in '''Northern Hokkaidou (Node G)'''
* Patrol and '''take out all enemy forces (S Rank)''' in the '''outer Hokkaidou Sea (Node O)'''
* Patrol and '''take out all enemy forces (S Rank)''' near '''Hitokappu Bay (Node S)'''
* Patrol and reach '''Hitokappu Bay (Node U)'''

Note that all condition as of current are based on Hard Difficulty and can vary in lower difficulty. Most of these nodes can be done without the assistance of LBAS at this point unless you need assistance.

'''Patrol around the Stugaru Strait and reach the base in Northern Hokkaidou  (Node G) and take out all enemy forces (S Rank) in the Outer Hokkaidou Sea (Node O) and Hitokappu Bay (Node S)'''

'''Recommended Fleet'''<br>
'''1CL, 4DD, 1DE'''

'''Path: D-B-C-F-G'''<br>
'''Path: D-H-I-L-O-R'''<br>
'''Path: D-H-I-L-Q-P-S''' '''LoS of 27 (Cn2)[https://ch.nicovideo.jp/lambda/blomaga/ar1765248] needed'''

* Bring a Fleet with a mix of combat and ASW for Node G.
* Use line abreast against subs and use vangard against surface fleets
* Your fleet should eventually reach G with little to no difficulty.

* For '''Node O''' and '''Node S''' fleet will need to be more armed for Surface combat.
* Use line abreast against subs and use vanguard against surface fleets while making your trip to the nodes you need to target
* Use Line Ahead on both node to ensure you can eliminate the enemy fleet in the area and get an S rank.
* Be sure to bring enough Radars and Seaplane Scouts to meet the requirements to go to '''node S'''

'''Patrol and reach Hitokappu Bay (Node U)'''

'''Recommended Fleet'''<br>
'''1CL, 3-4DD, 0-1DE (5 ships only)''' 
'''4-6 DD, 0-2 DE''' 

'''Path: D-H-I-J-L-Q-T-U'''

* Bring a Fleet with a mix of combat and ASW for Node G.
* Use line abreast against subs and use vangard against surface fleets.
* Your fleet should eventually reach U with little to no difficulty.

Once all conditions are met the '''path to Node W''' will be revealed.

From there all you need to do is defeat the main enemy fleet lead by the new '''[[Light Cruiser Tsu-Class|Tsu-class Flagship]]'''

'''Recommended Fleet'''<br>
'''0-1 CAV, 1-2 CL, 4DD'''<br>
'''1 CL, 5 DD'''

'''Path: D-H-I-J-L-O-W''' '''LoS of 50 (Cn3)[https://ch.nicovideo.jp/lambda/blomaga/ar1765248] needed'''

* Bring a surface combat focused fleet to help provide a chance to stand up against the enemy fleets in boss node.
* It's optional to begin a CAV (which can provide an edge in both Node O and W) or use (2 CL to conserve CAVs for possible later operations) 
* You will need a relatively good LoS (about 50 (CN 3)''(verification required)'') to avoid hitting node V and go straight to W. 
* Node O may present the only problem with your fleet at Node O due to it's strong torpedo squadron. Using an LBAS on this can be considered if necessary.
* On Medium Difficulty or higher, you'll need to bring 3 or more Surface Radars

The boss will be a '''[[Light Cruiser Tsu-Class|Tsu-class Flagship]]''' which has HP on par to a Flagship Transport, and the combat strength similar to a battleship along with a much higher AA which will give it's fleet stronger AA in general. The Tsu-class will have several other CLs and DD in tow (and more elite Tsu-classes on higher difficulty.)

Bringing an LBAS to the boss may present some risks for you planes as they may get shot down and possibly loose rank but otherwise should help you clear out most of the enemy ships easily. If you bring name squadron planes like the '''Nonaka Squadron''' and other various named or skilled planes, it'll be more likely to survive the surface AA attacks. 

If your [[LBAS]] clear out enough it should result in an eays fight where you wipe out almost everyone and finish off the Tsu-class in night battle. Repeat until the operation is complete. 

'''LBAS Recommendation'''

'''4 Ryuusei or 4 Land Base Bombers (Range 5)'''

* Everything on this map will have no air power, so bringing only bombers here is a good way to take out any problems that may appear and due to how easy the map is, it's possible to use this place to rank up planes as well.

==DarkHeron's Proposal for Easy/Casual Mode==

'''Tips'''
*You could potentially make use of the comps in medium or hard mode
*East and Casual Mode omits Ship Locks so it allows a lot of flexibility to try and use your best ships here

'''Land Base:'''
*Boss node has 0 Airpower. Use 4 land base bomber and send them there
**The boss is a Tsu class boat so be warned that planes might have the potential to be shot down by Tsu
*Alternatively, you can send land base to the pre-boss node if you're not confident with sending them to the boss-node
*Sending Ryuuseis to the boss is fine as the range isn't too high and you don't have 4 land base bomber to use in land base.

'''Equipment'''
*Equip your DD and CL with the best guns you have in your base and make sure to be able to have Radars on them for routing
*There is a LOS Check. Use CA or CL in order for you to be able to have high LOS from recon planes if you don't have enough radars to put on each ship

'''Suppport Expeditions'''
*It is recommended that you utilized support expeditions in the fleet in case you can't kill the boss with your fleet firepower
**Boss Expedition is required and Node Support Expedition is optional
*Recommended Support Expedition Setup
**3BB, 1 CV, 2DD
***Have BB with 3 Guns/radar and CV with your Dive Bombers and Radars.

==Combined Proposal==

E-1 is relatively simple to do on this event even on hard difficulty with a moderately trained fleet. As most of the map will require you to engage against simple surface fleets and submarines. 

A good general recommendation for who to choose for this map if you play on normal or hard difficulty is avoid using fleets affiliated with '''Pearl Harbor''', the <span style="color:Yellow; text-shadow:0px 0px 2px black;">'''2nd Fleet and Operation Ten-Go Members'''</span>, and '''fleets that made up <span style="color:Blue; text-shadow:0px 0px 2px black;">Operation AL and Northern Forces'''</span>. Most other standard ships that are not key ships and are average in combat are suitable for this map.

If you are a newer player who only just recently started playing KanColle, playing on Easy or Casual difficulty omits Ship Locks. This allows you lots of flexibility as you can use your best ships while attempting to clear the map without heavy resource depletion.

'''Node Summary'''
* Nodes D & L are choice nodes.
* Nodes S & W (boss node) have LoS checks (see boss node details below).
* Nodes C, O, Q, S, and W are surface nodes. Most other nodes are sub nodes, choice nodes, or blue nodes.

* Patrol and reach '''Hitokappu Bay (Node U)'''

Note that all condition as of current are based on Hard Difficulty and can vary in lower difficulty. Most of these nodes can be done without the assistance of LBAS at this point unless you need assistance.

* Bring a fleet with a mix of combat and ASW for Node G.
* Use Line Abreast against subs and use Vangard against surface fleets
* Your fleet should eventually reach G with little to no difficulty.

* For '''Node O''' and '''Node S''' fleet will need to be more armed for Surface combat.

* Be sure to bring enough Radars and Seaplane Scouts to meet the requirements to go to '''node S'''

'''Patrol and reach Hitokappu Bay (Node U)'''

'''Recommended Fleet'''<br>
'''1CL, 3-4DD, 0-1DE (5 ships only)''' 
'''4-6 DD, 0-2 DE''' 

'''Path: D-H-I-J-L-Q-T-U'''

* Bring a Fleet with a mix of combat and ASW for Node G.
* Use Line Abreast against subs and use Vanguard against surface fleets.
* Your fleet should eventually reach Node U with little to no difficulty.

Once all conditions are met the '''path to Node W''' will be revealed.

From there all you need to do is defeat the main enemy fleet led by the new '''[[Light Cruiser Tsu-Class|Tsu-class Flagship]]'''.

'''Recommended Fleet'''<br>
'''0-1 CAV, 1-2 CL, 4DD'''<br>
'''1 CL, 5 DD'''

'''Path: D-H-I-J-L-O-W''' '''LoS of 50 (Cn3)[https://ch.nicovideo.jp/lambda/blomaga/ar1765248] needed'''

* Bring a surface combat focused fleet to help provide a chance to stand up against the enemy fleets in boss node.

If your [[LBAS]] clear out enough enemy ships it should result in an easy fight where you wipe out almost everyone and finish off the Tsu-class in night battle. Repeat until the operation is complete. Alternatively, you can target Node O if it provides difficulty or if you're concerned about plane ranks and would prefer to use a support fleet on the boss.

'''Support Fleets'''

* Using a Support fleet at the boss node is not entirely necessary as the boss is easy enough to defeat without it, but if for some reason you experience problems setting up a support fleet can be considered with a fleet consisting of '''3BB, 1 CV, 2DD''' and having your BBs with Guns/radar, CV with your Dive Bombers and Radars and DDs with Radars. 

* Alternatively you can also consider '''4 CA, 2 DD''' in support fleet in a similar set up since it'll be cheaper and can kill most of the lighter enemy ships.

'''LBAS Recommendation'''

'''4 Ryuusei or 4 Land Base Bombers (Range 5)'''

* Everything on this map will have no air power, so bringing only bombers here is a good way to take out any problems that may appear and due to how easy the map is, it's possible to use this place to rank up planes as well.
