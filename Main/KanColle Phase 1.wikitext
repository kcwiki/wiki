'''KanColle Phase 1''' also known as the '''"Flash Era of KanColle"''' began in '''April 23rd, 2013''' and has lasted for a total of 5 years. Approximately around '''April 23rd, 2018''' KanColle will end "Phase 1" of its development cycle and will begin to move into '''[[Phase 2]]''' of it's game development which will begin with ditching the flash based system KanColle has used up till now as its main platform. Due to the recent changes in which flash become a less desired platform by even web browsers, KanColle has recently made an announcement that the game will end it's run of Flash by its 5th Anniversary and will be migrated to HTML 5. All content and data has been announced to be migrating with the transfer.  

The purpose of this page will be to cover the entirety of KanColle's Phase 1 development history regarding the '''Browser Version''' of KanColle from it's beginning all the way to when the game end's it's run on Flash.

===Development History===

KanColle's history has been a long and interesting development that began with lots of early planning that based on some interviews started approximately around Late 2011 and would be released in it's basic form around '''April 23rd, 2013'''. The following history chart will use info gathered from the mentioned interviews, along with the KanColle 4th Anniversary issue from Comptiq Magazine, and update note history gathered over the course of it's development cycle. 

All development notes will be updated till the end of '''Phase 1''' has been reached.
