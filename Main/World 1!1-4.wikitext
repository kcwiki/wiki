===Tips===
*This is the first map in which the enemy fleets possess carriers (with at least one node of carriers in every route). If you do not bring your own carriers, your ships must deal with aerial bombing prior to being able to counter-attack during the shelling phase(s). You have a few ways to deal with enemy carriers:
# Ignore the enemy carriers' bombing, which is possible with durable ships (at least CLs, preferably CAs or higher);
# Bring a submarine-only fleet (likely from construction as there are no submarine drops between 1-1 and 1-4) as only enemy CL and DDs can attack submarines; or
# Bring your own carriers, which can be obtained through either remodeling [[Chitose]] and/or [[Chiyoda]] at Level 15 to CVL or through normal construction.
*The third method will also help in completing the quest chain which rewards [[Akagi]]: [[Quests#A11|A11]] (have a CV(L) and 3 destroyers in your second fleet) and [[Quests#B10|B10]] (sink an enemy carrier).
*This map is also convenient for completing [[Quests#Bw2|Bw2]], preferably with a fleet of three subs. The echelon formations here hurt them far less than those in [[World 2|2-2]].

'''Recommended Fleet'''
*'''1 AV 1 CL 2 DD 2 XX'''
*'''4 DD 2 XX'''; No SS(V) in fleet.
