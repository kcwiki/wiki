The '''"Summer 2019 Event"''', '''European Counterattack Operation! Commence "Operation Shingle"''' is scheduled to begin on ''' August 30th'''. The scale of the event is Small Scale, and it consists of 3 maps (2 Main Operations and 1 Extra Operation).

Currently, only Main Operation maps are accessible. The Extra Operation is scheduled to be released on '''September 4th, Wednesday'''.

The theme of the event will be a '''"European Interception / Counterattack Operation'''. The first operational area will have your fleet sortieing from the naval base in Brest, France to intercept Abyssal forces heading to Brittany, France. Eventually, your fleet will travel to Italy, where the final operation will be an amphibious landing operation. Expect to use Anti-Installation equipment for the final part of the event.

==Historical Background==

'''Disclaimer: The following information is based upon a summary of World War II history and may not have any bearing on in-game mechanics. This is for historical reference only.'''

'''Operation Shingle'''

[[wikipedia:Battle of Anzio|Operation Shingle]]

Operation Shingle AKA, the Battle of Anzio served as a major battle front at the beginning of 1944 where the British and the American Forces proceeded to storm and land in Anzio, Italy. To attempt to gain control of the Italian costal front. 

E-3 mainly represents the naval battle that took place in Anzio, Italy leading to the storming of the city. Because there it not many historical ships tied to this event outside of [[Jervis]] and [[Janus]], in place of this, ships that have national ties to Britain, America, Italy, and Germany will have greater importance here.

Each rocket interceptor modifies your entire land base air strength by the following (0.3/0.3/0.1)

==Friend Fleet==
===Fleet Formations===
Friend Fleets will now come with a new function which will allow players to choose if they wish to bring in a Friend Fleet to aid them in battle or not. They can also choose to also decide if they want a normal Friend Fleet come aid them in battle or if they wish to use a powerful Friend Fleet that will require the cost of '''6 Instant Constructions''' [[File:Instant_construction-0.jpg]] to allow you call in a more powerful Friend Fleet to aid you into battle. 

If you choose to opt in for the powerful Friend fleet, the '''Instant Constructions''' [[File:Instant_construction-0.jpg]] will not be consumed unless a powerful Friend Fleet appears.

==Mechanics==
===Participation requirements===
*Must have a 75% sortie win ratio.
*Must have 5 empty ship slots for new ships.
*Must have 20 free equipment slots.

===Special Mechanics===
#The difficulty system first used in [[Spring 2015 Event]] returns: you can choose between Operation A ({{lang|ja|甲}}, Hard), Operation B ({{lang|ja|乙}}, Medium), Operation C ({{lang|ja|丙}}, Easy) or Operation D ({{lang|ja|丁}}, Very Easy) .
#*Choosing A or B requires certain HQ Level (HQ Lv 35 for B / 80 for A in Spring 2015 Event).
#*'''An important note''' to all Admirals intending to clear the event on Hard difficulty - further (new) conditions now apply:'''
#**When switching difficulty from ''any other difficulty'' to Hard, the map's debuff mechanism (where applicable) will be reset.
#***Switching between any other difficulties will not reset the debuff mechanism.
#The debuff system from [[Summer 2015 Event]]'s final map, where certain nodes had to be killed to reduce boss armor will return.
# It might be possible, that they will allow a fleet with '''seven''' ships ('''[[Striking Force Fleet]]''') to sortie to certain event maps that allow '''single fleet operations''' starting from '''E-2''', and also includes the '''final''' map of the event.
#*The Striking Force '''cannot''' be sortied during exercises or sent on expeditions while it contains seven ships.
#*The Striking Force can only be created and used in the '''third''' fleet in the menu (out of a total of four fleets).
#*A Striking Force with a flagship that carries a new piece of equipment, the '''Striking Force Fleet Command Facility''', will be able to make use of the new '''Single Ship Evacuation''' mechanic.
#**The new Single Ship Evacuation mechanic that will become available for the Striking Force as of E-4 allowing a single ship in the fleet to retreat from the battlefield after an enemy engagement if she suffered heavy damage.
#***It is possible for the damage to become even worse during a Single Ship Evacuation.
#***Unlike the Combined Fleet's evacuation mechanic, it does not require an escort destroyer.
#**The new Striking Force Fleet Command Facility will become obtainable and useable via the old [[Fleet Command Facility]] and the '''Action Report''' that can be earned in the upcoming Fall Event. The [[Fleet Command Facility]], as well as the new Action Report item, will be obtainable on all difficulty levels, including Medium and Easy Mode.
#**Supplementary information regarding the new [[Striking Force Fleet Command Facility]] and the Single Ship Evacuation it allows when carried by the striking force's flagship:
#***The evacuation does not require an escort destroyer.
#***The evacuation consumes the ship's entire fuel & ammo reserves. 
#***Only one ship can be evacuated per battle.
#***'''The damage the ship suffered may become worse during the evacuation, but she will never sink.'''
# Returning this event, the '''Vanguard Formation''' can be used .
#*This formation will organize the fleet such that the 3rd-6th/7th ships protect the Flagship and 2nd Ship of the Fleet.
#**In addition, the formation allows for ships to become more evasive in combat situations, especially with well-trained Destroyer.
#** This formation is also available '''only during the duration of the event.'''
#**The formation will be usable by [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/930623111862435841 both] normal fleets as well as the Striking Force Fleet.
#'''New:''' '''NPC Friend Fleets''' have been introduced into the game.
#* Friend Fleets act as another unit that appears in particular battles to help aid your fleet when attacking the enemy at the start of night battle.
#** NPC Friend Fleets are selected from a randomized preset list of ship.
#** Depending on who you have in your fleet can also influence who will be arrive to aid you in battle.
#'''New:''' '''Enemy Radar Ambush Nodes''' is introduced into the game.
#* Entering this node will result in your fleet facing off against an enemy fleet that will ambush and attack your fleet 
#** Your Fleet will not be able to fight against the enemy Fleet.
#** By meeting certain conditions, you can evade these nodes.

*Node '''L''' is a Surface Combat Node

</tabber>

Completing these tasks will unlock Node N containing the Boss

'''Phase 2: Fighting [[Summer French Battleship Princess]]'''

To clear the map, you are required to deplete the HP Bar by damaging the [[Summer French Battleship Princess]] and sink her on Last Dance. As she has up to '''254 Armour''' on Last Dance, bringing TCI or Ships with historical Bonus is highly recommended.

As the Preboss nodes are fairly weak, you can send a 5 Range LBAS to the Boss. You are required to have 58 Fighterpower to meet Air Denial on all compositions.

AS on the boss itself ranges from 108-257, so plan the Aircraft of the LBAS and your Fleet accordingly

There are two routes:

<tabber>
|-|North=
*Recommended Composition is 1(F)BB(V) 1CA(V) 1CL 3DD
*Recommended LBAS for First Land Base is 1-2 Fighter / 2-3 Torpedo Bomber or Land Base Bombers
*The Route is '''C-E-F-G-M-N''' 
**Nodes '''C, G''' being unimpressive torpedo squadrons, '''M''' being a subnode, '''E''', '''F''' being choice nodes and '''N''' being the Boss node
**There is a '''RADAR-Check''' requiring you to bring at least '''2 Surface RADARs'''
**There is a '''LoS-Check''' at node '''G'''
*This approach limits the Airpower you are allowed to bring to the boss, so you might not be able to make use of Daytime Special Attacks
*Bringing Boss Support is recommended
|-|South=
*Recommended Composition is '''1(F)BB(V) 1CL 1-2CVL 2-3DD''' or ''''1(F)BB(V) 1CL 1CVL 1CA(V) 2DD'''
*Recommended LBAS for First Land Base is 1 Fighter / 3 Torpedo Bomber or Land Base Bombers
*The Route is '''C-E-H-L-N''' 
** Nodes '''C''','''H''' and '''L''' being surface combat nodes, '''E''' being a choice node and N being the Boss node
**There is a RADAR-Check requiring you to bring at least '''2 Surface RADARs'''
**There is a '''LoS-Check''' at node '''H'''
*This approach allows you to bring more daytime firepower to the boss as achieving Air superiority and using special attacks will help your Damage. However, you will be arriving under a slight Ammo Penalty as you are facing three preboss-nodes.
*Bringing Boss Support is recommended

'''Locking Recommendation'''

On Hard difficulty, several considerations should be taken into account (as these will also affect your potential options for E-3, the final map).

# Do you have [[Nagato|Nagato K2]], [[Mutsu|Mutsu K2]], and/or [[Nelson]]?
# Do you have the majority of Allied ships, i.e. [[Nelson]], [[Iowa]], [[Saratoga]], [[Jervis]], [[Warspite]], [[Ark Royal]], [[Intrepid]], [[Johnston]], and [[Fletcher]]? ([[Richelieu]] if she is not locked to E-1?)
# Do you have other Axis force ships such as [[Prinz Eugen]], [[Italia]], [[Roma]], [[Bismarck]], [[Pola]], [[Zara]], and [[Garibaldi]]?
# Do you plan to challenge Hard on E-3 after this?
# If so, how do you intend to split your existing resources between E-2 and E-3?

If you are confident that you have sufficient resources to split between E-2 and E-3, you can consider using the guide below as it will cover mostly Hard mode preparations. Otherwise, if you plan to do Medium or less, there is no reason to hold back on who your bring to get the best out of your fleet as E-3 will have '''no lock''' on Medium or below. A rough outline of possible asset allocation (hello, economics 101, scarcity) follows.

Also note that current research suggests that [[Ark Royal]], [[Jervis]], and Italian ships in general have the highest bonus modifiers for the E-2 P2 boss (E-2 P1 boss is essentially an anti-installation equipment check). Allied ships generally appear to have higher bonus modifiers for the E-3 P2 boss. The E-3 P1 boss is generally vulnerable to anti-installation set-ups, and also takes torpedo damage into account.

*[[Nelson]]: More suited to E-3 due to her versatility in triggering her special attack with other ships. Mutsu and Nagato require a BB to do so (which is arguably much less useful in E-3, given the amount of anti-installation combat involved).
**She will need a speed boost set-up (turbine + boiler) for E-3 P1, however, due to speed restrictions.
*[[Mutsu]]/[[Nagato]]: More suited for E-2 Part 2, as it is a typical surface combat node (no anti-installation combat involved).
**If not speed-boosted and/or running a superheavy fleet, they will take a longer route, however.
*[[Garibaldi]]: The case can be made for use in both E-2 as well as E-3.
**If locked to E-2, her sister [[Duca degli Abruzzi]] can be powerlevelled relatively quickly post-clear to fill in for E-3 instead.
*[[Italia]] and [[Roma]]: Generally more useful here due to the higher Italian bonus modifier, as well as the Fast fleet requirement for the shortest route.
*[[Ark Royal]]: Very high bonus modifier on E-2, useful here.
*[[Johnston]] and [[Fletcher]]: Bonus modifier on E-3 (none apparent on E-2?), although it may be viable to split 1 each between E-2 and E-3 if there is a need for this.
*[[Jervis]]: Could be used in either E-2 or E-3, depending on what other resources you have available.
**In both cases, main utility is TCI potential due to high boss armour.
*[[Prinz Eugen]]: Again, could be used on either map.
**In both cases, main utility is TCI potential due to high boss armour.
*[[Iowa]]: More useful for E-3 due to higher modifier there. No apparent bonus on E-2(?).
*[[Colorado]]: Same as Iowa, although her very specific requirements for her special attack to trigger limit her usefulness there (especially given that E-3 requires anti-installation equipment).
*[[Saratoga]] and [[Intrepid]]: More useful for E-3 due to higher modifier there. No apparent bonus on E-2(?).
*[[Pola]]: Probably more useful for E-2 (higher modifier), somewhat viable in E-3.
*[[Zara]]: Higher modifier for E-2 as well, but depending on locks, may be more useful in E-3 instead.
*[[Bismarck]]: Whatever.


'''LBAS'''
*You have '''two land bases''' to sortie available on this map
*The required Range to the first boss is '''2''', the Range to the second phase boss is '''6'''
*Be aware that LBAS Range starts at '''2''' on this map. If you have [[Prototype Shuusui]], [[Me 163B]] or [[Shuusui]] in your LBAS deployed to Sortie, you will not be able to enter the map as the game will notify you your LBAS range is too short to participate. 

'''First Phase: Going through Gibraltar'''

The E2P1 boss is essentially an anti-installation equipment check.

There are three approaches to defeat the Boss. One involves a Surface Task Force allowing you to bring more firepower, the other a Transport Combined Fleet, enabling you to skip a dangerous Preboss Node

<tabber>
|-|
Light Surface Task Force=
*Main Fleet: '''1 FBB 1 CVL, 2CA(V),2XX(CA(V)/AV/DD)'''
*Escort Fleet: '''1CL, 2 CA, 3 DD'''
*Fleet path will go '''B-D-G-K-M-N'''
* All ships will need an ''' initial speed of fast''' otherwise you will go to node F
* You cannot speed modify ships to take this route.
* The Main threat on this node will be node K which will feature some battle ships and carriers in the fleet that can possibly damage your fleet.
*In your main fleet, FBBs should use an AP shell, any CA(V)should use Type 3 Shells, AVs/ DDs in the main fleet should use a combination of Daihatsu, Tanks, WG42, Anti Ground Rockets or Mortars.
* Escort fleet should be armed to do double attack set ups. Any 4 slot CL should consider a 2 gun + WG42 / Anti-Ground Rocket set up, CAs should use a Type 3 shell and DDs should use a double attack with 2 guns + WG42 / Anti-Ground Rocket if possible.
*If necessary bring AA guns/skilled lookout to pick off any PT imps that survive the LBAS air strikes.
|-|
Heavy Surface Task Force=
*Main Fleet: '''2-3 (F)BB 1-2 CVL ,2XX(CA(V)/AV/DD)'''
*Escort Fleet: '''1CL, 2 CA, 3 DD'''
*Fleet path will go '''B-D-F-J-K-M-N'''
* All ships will need an '''speed of fast''' otherwise you will go to node G
* You can speed modify ships to take this route.
* The fleet's strength is overall strong, but will be expensive to run.
* In your main fleet, BBs should use an AP shell, any CA(V)should use Type 3 Shells, AVs/ DDs in the main fleet should use a combination of Daihatsu, Tanks, WG42, Anti Ground Rockets or Mortars.
* Escort fleet should be armed to do double attack set ups. Any 4 slot CL should consider a 2 gun + WG42 / Anti-Ground Rocket set up, CAs should use a Type 3 shell and DDs should use a double attack with 2 guns + WG42 / Anti-Ground Rocket if possible.
*If necessary bring AA guns/skilled lookout to pick off any PT imps that survive the LBAS air strikes.
|-|
Transport Combined Fleet=
*Main Fleet: '''2CAV 4DD OR 1CA(V)/AV 1CVL 4DD'''
*Escort Fleet: 1CL 3DD 2CA
*LBAS: 4x Bombers to boss node, both bases
*About '''150 FP''' is needed for AS at the boss node, assuming 4 waves of AD LBAS prior to fleet's air battle phase
*This fleet is more vulnerable than an STF fleet, but takes the shortest route to the boss ('''B-A-C-E-M-N''')
*Along this route, you will mainly face off against torpedo squadrons and submarines.
*On LD, support expeditions may help with pass rate, as well as with clearing out the boss' fleet prior to the surface combat phase
*Equip your escort fleet for anti-installation DA attacks during the night battle phase
**The [[Toku Daihatsu Landing Craft + 11th Tank Regiment]] is useful for these set-ups, if available, due to its high damage modifier
*If neesary bring AA guns/skilled lookout to pick off any PT imps that survive the LBAS air strikes.

'''Second Phase: Killing the [[Abyssal Mediterranean Princess]]'''

There are two options: Fast STF and Superheavy STF. Both will reach the boss fairly consistently, but expect LD to be more difficult to clear due to the boss' high armour on LD.

LD on hard mode is especially difficult as you will be pitted up against a powerful [[Heavy Cruiser Princess]] along with the [[Abyssal Mediterranean Princess]]. Both which will have extremly high armor (278 and 288 resepctively)

Friend Fleets may make LD somewhat easier once implemented. Until then, however, expect to face some difficulty in clearing as you are effectively rolling for crits against the boss' armour.

<tabber>
|-|
Fast STF=
*Main Fleet: Ark Royal 2FBB 2CA(V) 1CL
**CA(V)s and CL should be able to equip SPFs to supplement FP
**It may be preferable to save [[Zara|Zara Due]] for E-3 Hard, sortieing [[Pola]] here is fairly safe
**FBBs should be FBBs with bonus damage modifiers (ideally [[Roma]] & [[Littorio]] due to Italian modifiers; also [[Bismarck]], [[Richelieu]], etc.)
**[[Ark Royal]] is preferred due to her very high damage modifier
*Escort Fleet: 1CL 2CLT 1CA 2DD
**As many TCI set-ups as you can fit here (less CLTs for obvious reasons) due to boss' high armour, especially on LD
**'''TBC''': It may be preferable(?) to save [[Jervis]] and [[Prinz Eugen]] for E-3 instead.
**It may be viable to use [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] here, and subsequently train [[Duca degli Abruzzi]] post-clear for use in E-3 instead (assuming she has a bonus modifier on that map as well).
*LBAS: 1 LBAS fighter/interceptor + 3 LBAS bombers, both bases to boss
**Exact amount of FP your fleet requires depends on the quality of LBAS fighter/interceptors & bombers that engage the boss' fleet prior to fleet's air combat phase, use a calculator such as [http://kancollecalc.jp/air_supremacy.html this] to run estimations
**For the fleet, about 270+ FP should be safe (again, depending on quality of LBAS equipment)
*Support Expeditions will help with pass rate and clearing out the boss' fleet
*Route: '''O-P-T-V'''
|-|
Superheavy STF=
*Main Fleet: 4(F)BB(V) + Ark Royal + 1AO
**Speed does not matter for this fleet, but make sure that you have no more than '''6''' (F)BB(V) + CV(L/B) + CA(V) total (across both Main+Escort Fleet)
**This fleet does not care about your feelings, assumes you are okay with the sheer amount of resource burn, and is fundamentally designed for maximising damage at the boss node
***Even then, it can and will fail to clear, simply because the boss' armour is very high and difficult to penetrate without bonus modifiers and/or crits
**[[Nagato|Nagato Kai Ni]] and [[Mutsu|Mutsu Kai Ni]] are preferred here for their special attack, along with 2 other BBs (probably [[Littorio]] and [[Roma]] due to their bonus modifiers)
***Save [[Nelson]] for E-3, as she has more flexibility and can trigger her special attack even with ships with anti-installation set-ups
**The AO should have 1 [[Maritime Resupply]] to replenish the fleet prior to engaging the boss, so as to negate the ammo penalty from the 3 surface battle nodes + 1 air raid node prior to the boss.
*Escort Fleet: 1CL 2CLT 1CA 2DD
**As many TCI set-ups as you can fit here (less CLTs for obvious reasons) due to boss' high armour, especially on LD
**Variations upon this theme exist:
***It is possible to replace the CA with a night CVL, although its utility is debatable (it will help with FP, at the very least)
***(Anything else? AACI DD in place of CLT, esp. if said CLT is Kiso?)
**'''TBC''': It may be preferable(?) to save [[Jervis]] and [[Prinz Eugen]] for E-3 instead.
**It may be viable to use [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] here, and subsequently train [[Duca degli Abruzzi]] post-clear for use in E-3 instead (assuming she has a bonus modifier on that map as well).
*LBAS: 1 LBAS fighter/interceptor + 3 LBAS bombers, both bases to boss
**Exact amount of FP your fleet requires depends on the quality of LBAS fighter/interceptors & bombers that engage the boss' fleet prior to fleet's air combat phase, use a calculator such as [http://kancollecalc.jp/air_supremacy.html this] to run estimations
**For the fleet, about 270+ FP should be safe (again, depending on quality of LBAS equipment)
*Support Expeditions will help with pass rate and clearing out the boss' fleet
*Route: '''O-R-T-Q-V'''

'''Preparing for E-3'''

E-3 will require you to be well prepared in terms of Interceptor equipment, anti-installation equipment and specific ships that will help you turn the tides of battle more easily for the higher difficulties. Below is a list of important questions you may want to ask yourself prior to deciding upon what difficulty to challenge yourself with.

#Do you have plenty of anti-installation equipment that includes [[Type 3 Shell]]s, [[Type 91 AP Shell|AP Shells]]s, [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank]], [[Daihatsu]], [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tanks & Marines)|Daihatsu with Type 89 Tanks]], [[WG42]].[[Shipborne Model Type 4 20cm Anti-ground Rocket Launcher]]? (a minimum requirement for this map would be 2 Ka-Mi Tanks, 2 Daihatsu /w Type 89 Tanks, and 2 WG42 or Anti-ground rockets.)
#Do you have more rare anti-installation equipment such as the [[Toku Daihatsu Landing Craft + 11th Tank Regiment]] amd [[M4A1 DD]]?
#Do you have have '''at least 2 rocket interceptors''' from this event or from ranking?
#Do you have a way to achieve 1365 Air power with 3 land base groups set to Air Defense? (rank your Rocket interceptors and calculate the bonus they provide before hand)
#Do you have decent amount of foreign ships left over that come from Italy, Germany, America, or Britain?

* If you said said to all of the above, you may be more than ready to tackle E-3.
* If you for some reason said no to question 3 specifically, you can forget about Hard mode, and Normal difficulty may also be questionable due to the lack of Rocket Interceptors you own. You may have to consider only easy so you can earn another Rocket Interceptor to help give you edge in future event.
* If you cannot successfully achieve question 4, you may want to question about doing hard more, but it may be still possible to beat, but you will need to skip the final debuff step. Also waiting till Friend Fleets arrive could also help.

'''Key Ships to consider'''

For E-3 any ship that hails from Italy, Germany, America, or Britain are consider useful for this map. As they will all have useful bonuses which are further listed below. Do note that if you complete the debuff requirements you the affects will stack even further. Below is a list of some ships you should consider preserving for E-3 if possible:

* [[Nelson]] - Her Special attack the "Nelson Touch" will be key assest to helping clear out most of the key nodes and boss fights on this map along with her bonus. Using her along with ships that use anti-installation nuke setups can potentially wipe out most boss installations with ease. If you own her, she a must for this map.
* [[Garibaldi]] or [[Duca degli Abruzzi]] - Both of them have a good damage bonus and being 4 slot CLs make them useful for both combat and anti-installation combat all together.
* [[Johnston]] and [[Fletcher]] - Useful mainly for the final segments of the event, since they have high luck, a good bonus, and can TCI efficiently. They can also provide help for Node F if you let them take up an ASW role in between.
* [[Iowa]] - Over all the strongest combat BB in the American group. She can get good damage off with her bonus on this map. Can also be used in escort.
* [[Colorado]] -Weaker compared to most of the ships, she can be considered if you lack in most forgien ships only, however avoid using her special ability if possible because it has too much risk with little rewarding results.
* [[Saratoga]] and [[Intrepid]]- High Bonus CV that will be helpful in general
* [[Ark Royal]] If you didn't use her on E-2, she can be useful for this map as well.
* [[Zara]]- Can be good for day battle combat and battling installations, along with her bonus she can provide decent results.
* [[Prinz Eugen]] - More useful for the final segments of the event,  since she has high luck, a good bonus, and can TCI efficiently.
* [[Jervis]] - Overall the strongest of the TCI units that come with a bonus on this map. If you didn't use her on E-2, she will be a powerful asset for E-3's final boss fight.

In addition to the historical here some important non-historical can also be considered for this map which include:

* [[Commandant Teste]] and [[Nisshin]] - Both are powerful anti-installation nukes when combined properly with the right set up and used in conjunction with Nelson Touch will often yeild powerful results if they target the installations.
* [[Tashkent]] - a 4 Slot DD that can work as an efficient anti-installation DD, she can be a good subsistute for the above mentioned AVs.
* Asashio-class Kai 2 DDs - Most Asashio-class DDs can work as suitable anti-installation DDs though if possible have [[Arashio]],[[Arare]] or [[Ooshio]] reserved as they are among the heavy hit anti-installation units. They can also work as subsitutes for the above mentioned AVs.

'''LBAS Key Notes'''
LBAS:
*You have access to all 3 LBAS bases.
*The range to the P1 boss (Node J) is 8.
*The range to the P2 boss (Node U) is 7.
*The range to Nodes O & T (required for unlocks) is 8.

'''Part 1: Destroying Anchorage Water Demon (Vacation Mode)'''

The most straightforward phase of the map. A Fast Surface Task Force with 2FBB and no CVs (CVL allowed, but no more than 3 BBs+CVLs) or Single Fleet (no speed and Ship Restrictions) will give you the fastest route to the boss.
The enemy Main Fleet features PT-Imp Packs. While their ending torps don't pose a threat in this configuration, they are considerable tanks.

<tabber>
|-|STF=
*Route: '''A-F-I-J'''
*Nelson, if used (ideally with an RE slot), will require a speed boost set-up (turbine+boiler).
**Nelson Touch may be used to help with pre-boss clear rate at Node I, or to clear the boss fleet at Node J. Pick your poison.
*LBAS: 4 bombers on 2 bases to boss (Node J), 4 ASW (ideally Toukai) on 1 Base to node F to help with pass rate.
*Anchorage Summer Hime is weak against T3 Shell (1.45x), M4A1 DD from Summer E2H
**High Firepower Daihatsu-Capable DDs with DA set-up and/or AVs with M4A1 DD anti-installation set-up can 'nuke' and kill Anchorage Hime with ease.
|-|Single Fleet=
*Route: '''A-B-F-I-J'''
*There are no restrictions on the ships that you can take, so you can go as heavy as you want. There are also no Speed Restrictions
*The general idea is to go 3BB 3CV, ideally with Nelson as Flagship
**Setting up the CV in a way that they cannot target Installations while giving them 2 Divebombers will allow them to deal massive damage to the Anchorage Water Demon while ignoring 3 other targets of the main fleet.
**This approach however will cost you more bauxite (and planeranks) as you are taking a sizeable ammount of bombers against heavy Anti-Air
*Nelson Touch should be used to help with pre-boss clear rate at Node I. You can use it at the boss aswell, but it can trigger prematurly on the Escort Fleet which a heavy fleet like this should have no problems clearing out on their own
*LBAS: 4 bombers on 2 bases to boss (Node J), 4 ASW (ideally Toukai) on 1 Base to node F to help with pass rate.
**Since you are using a single Fleet, you are elegible to use Vanguard Formation on Node F

'''Part 2: Unlocking the Second Boss Node (U)'''

Once you defeat the '''[[Anchorage Water Demon (Vacation Mode)]]''' you will be able to unlock additional paths to other locations across the maps. During this part, your fleet will need to complete several major steps in order to gain access to Anzio (Node U). Below are the requirements that will be needed based upon difficulty.

'''Casual''' - '''B+ Rank Node E and O'''<br>
'''Easy''' - '''A+ Rank Nodes E,K and O'''<br>
'''Normal''' - '''A+ Rank Nodes E, and O and S rank Node K'''<br>
'''Hard''' - ''''A+ Rank Nodes E, A+ Rank O Twice, S rank Node K and achieve AS at the Land Base Air Raid'''<br>

Each difficulty is scale accordingly so plan your method of how you will complete each step as the recommended requirements will be listed below.

<tabber>
|-|Node E=
* Fleet: '''Single''' -2-3(F)BB(V), 2 CV, 1-2 DD/AV
* Route: '''A-B-D-E'''
**Usage of Nelson is recommended as her Touch will make node E easier
*LBAS: 2 or 3 Land Base Groups, 1 Fighter, 3 bombers on 2 bases to Node E.
*Node E is filled with lots of various installations in the main group and a smaller fleet in escort.
**High Firepower Daihatsu-Capable DDs with DA set-up and/or AVs with M4A1 DD anti-installation set-up can 'nuke' and kill the majority of the installations.
* While not entirely necessary, bringing in-route support may be needed if you're aiming to S rank on hard. Lower difficulties will not require much effort as you can complete th requirement with an A rank.
|-|Node O=
* Fleet: Option 1: '''Surface Task Force''' 3 (F)BB(V), 1 CV, 2 CA(V)/DD/AV + 1 CL, 1-2 CA, 1-2 CLT, 2-3 DD '''(Recommended)'''
** Option 2: '''Carrier Task Force''' 2 (F)BB(V), 2 CV, 2CA(V)/DD/AV + 1 CL, 1-2 CA, 1-2 CLT, 2-3 DD
*Route: A-F-G-M-N-O
*LBAS: 1 Fighter, 3 bombers on 2 bases to Node E. 4 ASW Bombers on 1 base to Node F if possible.
* The main routing requirement is having less or equal 4 (F)BB(V)+CV(B/L)
**Alternatively, it is possible to use a Surface Task Force which will help you dealing with the preboss-nodes. You might consider bringing [[Ise|Ise Kai 2]] to augment your Fighterpower
**Have a DD set for PT Imp killer in Escort 
**Only A rank needed so load up with Anti-Installation equipment to kill off the Installation to secure an A rank.
***If using Nelson, consider incorporating Anti-Installation attacks into her Touch. (for example using [[Nisshin]] or [[Commandant Teste]])
**CA Hime does not need to die so focus on killing everyone else to secure the A-rank
|-|Node K=
* Fleet: '''Surface Task Force''' 3 (F)BB(V), 1 CV, 2 CA(V)/DD/AV + 1 CL, 1-2 CA, 1-2 CLT, 2-3 DD '''(Recommended)'''
**Route: A-F-G-M-L-K
*LBAS: 1 Fighter, 3 bombers on 2 bases to Node E. 4 ASW Bombers on 1 base to Node F if possible.
**Use a STF with less or equal 4 (F)BB(V)+CV(B/L)
***A STF will be able to dedicate the whole Escort Fleet to ASW to pass F-Node as they are unlikely to engage enemies after the main fleet in daytime shelling on the nodes present.
*The node is easy enough for you to S rank without a problem once you get there, especially considering that BB Hime takes extra damage from Land Base Bombers.
**On Casual You only need a B rank to successfully complete the requirement
|-|Land Base Defense=
*This requirement is '''Hard Mode Only'''
**Set-Up All 3 of your land base with Interceptors, Land Base Fighters, and any good fighter to get AS, this include the rocket interceptors that you may have obtained from ranking or from this event.
**Sortie am=n all submarine fleet to the map to save resources until the air raids trigger
**Be aware that you need Rocket Interceptors against High-Altitude Air Raids 
*** Without any interceptors you will only get 50% of your air power against high altitude bombers. 
*** With one interceptor you have a 80% air power vs. high altitude bombers
*** With two interceptor you have a 110% air power vs. high altitude bombers
*** With three interceptor you have a 120% air power vs. high altitude bombers
**For hard mode, it's '''highly recommended''' to max out your rocket interceptors to help make getting more easier.

</tabber>

Once all conditions are complete, you will unlock the path to Anzio (Node U) along with some additional paths which will be will be vital for the next step of the operation.

'''Part 3: Unlocking the Second Start Point'''

In this phase, you will be using your fleet to complete various objective around the map, this will including some difficult challenges as well as encountering the boss node and getting some victories against the boss itself. Below is a summary of the requirements you will need to complete.

'''Casual''' - '''AS Node N and A Rank Node U'''<br>
'''Easy''' - '''AS Nodes D, N and A Rank Nodes T, U'''<br>
'''Normal''' - '''AS Nodes D, N, R, A Rank Nodes T, U, achive AS at the Land Base Air Raid'''<br>
'''Hard''' - '''AS Nodes D, N, R, A Rank Nodes T Twice, U Twice, achieve AS at the Land Base Air Raid'''<br>

Depending on the difficulty you may need to complete additional steps, below are the steps that will summarize what is needed for each requirement.

<tabber>
|-|AS Node D=
* Fleet: '''Single''' 2-3(F)BB(V), 3 CV
* Route: '''A-B-D'''
* Obtaining AS from node D if you have 3 CV should be easy enough with a standard setup.
|-|AS Node N=
* Fleet: Option 1: '''Surface Task Force''' 2-3 (F)BB(V), 1-2 CVL, 2 CA(V)/DD/AV + 1 CL, 1-2 CA, 1-2 CLT, 2-3 DD '''(Recommended)'''
*Fleet: Options 2: '''Carrier Task Force'''(If going in route to T) 2 CV, 1 BB, 3 SS(V) + 1 CL, 2 DD, 3 SS or alternatively 1 AS, 1 CL, 2 DD, 0-2 CA, 0-2 CLT
*Route: A-F-G-M-N-(T)
*LBAS: STF method - If needed, 1-2 Land bases consisting of 3-4 fighters/land base fighters with a range of 7 to node N. 4 ASW Bombers on 1 base to Node F if possible.
* LBAS: CTF method to node T - 2 Land bases consisting of 1 fighter 3 Bomber with a range of 6 to Node G, 1 Land base consisting of Toukai or ASW bombers to Node F if possible.
*This can be done in conjunction with completing Node T requirements if needed.
**For additional info on Node T, please refer to Node T tab.
*For Carrier Task Force, method, you may need an in route support fleet to help survive the trip to N.
**If you use Surface Task Force are in need of air power, you can consider bringing 2 CVLs in place of a CV or a BBV like Ise Kai 2 and/or Hyuuga Kai 2 to bring additional air power. AV or CAVs as a seaplane fighter mule can also work as an alternative to BBVs or CVLs as long as you bring a CV along with them.
|-|AS Node R=
* Fleet: '''Surface Task Force''' 3(F)BB(V), 1-2AV, 1CV, 0-1 CL/CA(V) + 1 CL, 2 CA, 1 CLT, 2 DD
**Route: A-F-G-M-L-K-R-(U)
*LBAS: Option 1:  If needed, 1-2 Land bases consisting of 3-4 fighters/land base fighters with a range of 6 to node R. 4 ASW Bombers on 1 base to Node F if possible.  
*LBAS: Option 2: 1 Fighter, 3 bombers on 2 bases to Node U. 4 ASW Bombers on 1 base to Node F if possible.
*This can be done in conjunction with completing Node U requirements if needed.
** For more details on node U please reffer to Node U tab.
**Make sure your fighter power is about 380+ to AS R
|-|Node T=
* Fleet: '''Carrier Task Force'''(If going in route to T) 2 CV, 1 BB, 3 SS(V) + 1 CL, 2 DD, 3 SS or alternatively 1 AS, 1 CL, 2 DD, 0-2 CA, 0-2 CLT
**Route: A-F-G-M-N-T
* LBAS: 2 Land bases consisting of 1 fighter 3 Bomber with a range of 6 to Node G, 1 Land base consisting of Toukai or ASW bombers to Node F if possible.
*This can be done in conjunction with completing Node N requirements if needed.
**For additional info on Node T, please refer to Node T tab.
*If you use [[Taigei]] she can stand in to represent all 3 subs in the one part in either your main or escort fleet allowing for other ship types to be used.
**It's recommended to put [[Taigei]] in flagship position of the escort fleet. As it'll allow you to bring in a stronger escort fleet and minimize the threat your subs will face from nodes A and G.
*If you do not have [[Taigei]] or converted her to Ryuuhou, you will need to bring a total of 6 subs which will present a great danger to your fleet along the trip, especially for nodes A and G. 
*In-route Support Fleet is highly recommended as well to improve your passing rate against these nodes till you can reach Node T. 
*Rocket Launcher Kai 2s are also recommended for your CV as node N will have a more concentrated attack against your surface ships. Thus this can reduce the likelihood of possible damage.
|-|Node U=
*Fleet: 2BB, 1-2AV, 2CV, 0-1 DD/CL/CA + 1 CL, 2 CA, 1 CLT, 2 DD
*Route: A-F-G-M-L-K-R-U
*LBAS: Option 2: 1 Fighter, 3 bombers on 2 bases to Node U. 4 ASW Bombers on 1 base to Node F if possible.
*This can be done in conjunction with completing Node R requirements if needed.
**For additional info on Node R, please refer to Node R tab.
**This route will force you to incurred some ammo penalty when you reached the boss
***The DD/CL/AV in the main fleet if the use should be set up to 'nuke' the installation such as Supply Depot Hime
***Make sure your fighter power is about 380+ to both AS the boss and node R
|-|Land Base Defense=
*If you are playing hard mode, all the below mentioned are required are the same as before hand.
**Set-Up All 3 of your land base with Interceptors, Land Base Fighters, and any good fighter to get AS, this include the rocket interceptors that you may have obtained from ranking or from this event.
**Sortie an all submarine fleet to the map to save resources until the air raids trigger
**Be aware that you need Rocket Interceptors against High-Altitude Air Raids 
*** Without any interceptors you will only get 50% of your air power against high altitude bombers. 
*** With one interceptor you have a 80% air power vs. high altitude bombers
*** With two interceptor you have a 110% air power vs. high altitude bombers
*** With three interceptor you have a 120% air power vs. high altitude bombers
**For hard mode, it's '''highly recommended''' to max out your rocket interceptors to help make getting more easier.

Once completed, '''all ships will get an additional 1.07x damage modifer''' against the boss fleet in Node U and the 2nd starting point will be unlocked for your Carrier Task Force or Transport Combined Fleet to use.

'''Part 4: Chip Anzio Hime until LD Range'''

With all the before mentioned phases complete, you will now need to deplete [[Anzio Princess]]'s HP bar down till the final phase of the battle, until then no additional steps are required.

*Make use of CTF fleet as the path is much uses up less fuel and ammo.
*Route: '''Start Point 2-B-F-G-M-L-K-R-U'''
**Recommended Fleet: 2 BB, 2 CV, 1-2 AV, 0-1 CL + 1 CL, 2-3 DD, 2 CA, 0-1 CLT 
*Set up your fleet so that you can use Nelson Touch with AV in 3rd slot and CL in 5th slot for touch
**Have your AV,CL, and/or DD run with SPF, wg42, Kami Tank, Marine Daihatsu

*Land Base Recommendation
**Base 1: Range 7 Fighter, 3 LBAA Bombers
**Base 2: Range 7 Fighter, 3 LBAA Bombers
**Base 3: 4x Toukai or how much anti Sub planes you can use
***You are sending this base to Node F to deal with New Submarine Hime

Once you are able to deplete her to the final phase of battle you can then choose to continue on with the final debuff phase(which is recommended if you can complete all the requirements. Or attempt to try to defeat the boss without the debuff which is possible, but quite difficult.

'''Part 5: Debuffing the Boss (once HP bar is within LD range ONLY)'''

For the final debuff phase, several changes will occure across the map which will make the last part of the challenge difficult in some difficulties which will include: 

**Some enemy comps are locked into thier hardest compositions this mainly noted in Nodes F, G and K
**Some Air Battles are locked in thier hardest compositions.
** Hardest Air Raids locked in LD.

Preparations will need to be made to make sure you can complete all of the requirements needed for this phase if you choose to do it. Below is a listing of all the requirements you will need to complete based on difficulty.

'''Casual''' - '''AS Node D and A+ Rank Node J {Single or TCF only)'''<br>
'''Easy''' - '''AS Node D and A+ Rank Node J {Single or TCF only), A+ Rank Node O'''<br>
'''Normal''' - '''AS Node D and A+ Rank Node J {Single or TCF only), A+ Rank Node O achive AS at the Land Base Air Raid'''<br>
'''Hard''' - '''AS Node D and H, A+ Rank Node J {Single or TCF only), A+ Rank Node E, O, achieve AS at the Land Base Air Raid'''<br>

It should be noted that because hard mode has such a high AS requirement, you will need to carefully check to see if you can successfully achive it. Do note that:
*Train your Rocket Interceptors to '''Double Chevelon''' if you wish to have a chance to successfully get AS against the Land Base Bombing attack as it'll be almost impossible to achieve it otherwise.
*'''Note''' For Hard Mode, make sure your land base value to be at least 1365 for defense.
**Also take into account that your FP will be penalized against the new bombers if you have any fewer than 2 jet interceptors in your LBAS.
**With 2 jet interceptors, there is a slight bonus 1.1x multiplier instead.
** If your land base total Fighter Power for defense is below this value, ignore this debuff and disregard this part entirely.
** If your playing on Medium there will be a much easier restriction which should make AS achievable with far less effort.

From here on, we will cover the steps required for each step needed to complete each phase this part.

*LBAS: 2 Land bases consisting of 4 Land Base Bombers with a range of 8 and send to node J. 4 ASW Bombers on 1 base to Node F if possible.  
*For this requirement to be considered complete you will need to A+ rank it with a Single Fleet or a Transport Combined Fleet.
**If use Nelson Touch, use the Touch skill at Node I to make passing that node easier due to Summer Carrier Princess.
**Otherwise, if you can pass to Node J, then use Nelson Touch there to make it easier to get an A rank.

It should be noted that unlike previous event, this segment does not have any ding notification to tell you if you completed the objective. You will only get an indication where '''all requirements are completed.'''

When all conditions are met, you should get a voice line to play when the result screen come up. You should here the [[Anzio Princess]] shout, "Tch, What the hell?!" indicating you completed the entire debuff requirement.

Once you successfully completed this step the following debuff changes will be added:
*1.15x From all ships vs Anzio Princess and Anchorage Water Demon only)

'''Part 6: Delivering the final kill against Anzio Princess'''

*Same Fleet composition are Part 4
*Route: '''Start Point 2-B-F-G-M-L-K-R-U'''
**Land Base Recommendation
**Base 1: Range 7 Fighter, 3 LBAA Bombers
**Base 2: Range 7 Fighter, 3 LBAA Bombers
**Base 3: Range 7 Fighter, 3 LBAA Bombers '''or''' 4x Toukai or how much anti Sub planes you can use
***For the final kill you can decide it you want to risk the final run be removing your ASW fleet in favor of bringing more potential damage to the final boss's fleet for LD, keep in mind however the New Submarine Princess will still pose a high threat to your fleet in general if you choose this path. If you feel confident, you can choose to keep your 3rd base on ASW focus to minimize the threat from Node F.
*The most efficient way to handle the final battle is to have your main fleet be anti-installation focused while your escorts be combat and Torpedo Cut-in Focused. 
*Using Americans and British ships are highly recommended if you have any. Italian and German ships will also provide decent results in battle. 
*As per usual, [[Nelson]] is a top recommendation along with anti-installation focused AVs/CL/DD in slots 3 and 5 are recommended so that it'll be possible for your fleet to deliver a highly effective damaging attack against the installation units in the main group with Nelson Touch.
*Other Americans like Iowa can also be decent for battling some of the installations as well as the [[Anzio Princess]]
*CVs like [[Saratoga]], [[Intrepid]] and [[Ark Royal]] can also deliver benifical damage against both installations and the [[Anzio Princess]]
* Escort fleet should be composed of mostly if not all combat focused ships. 
* American and British ships that can Torpedo Cut in such as [[Fletcher]], [[Johnston]] and [[Jervis]] make strong units in night battle for picking off both the [[Anchorage Water Demon (Vacation Mode)]] and [[Anzio Princess]]
** [[Garibaldi]] or [[Duca degli Abruzzi]] can also work as efficent TCI ships, or back up anti-installation units.
**  Make sure to bring your night battle equipment such as the [[Night scout]], [[Star Shell]] and [[Searchlight]] to help turn the tied in night battle.
**While the [[Artillery Imp]]s and [[Supply Depot Princess (Vacation Mode)]] are weak to various anti-installation gear, the [[Anchorage Water Demon (Vacation Mode)]] is also quite vunerable to torpedo cut-ins. 
*With enough historical ships set up in main and escort, it should be very possible to score an easy victory against the boss fleet.
*If you choose to attempt this without completing the Step 5 Debuff, expect some effort to be needed along with the hope for a possible crit as it will be needed to successfully defeat Anzio Princess.
**If worse comes to worse, you can also resort to Friend Fleets once they are released.
