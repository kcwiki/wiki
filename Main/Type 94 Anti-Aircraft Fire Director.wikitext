==Introduction==
比較的新しい高角砲対空射撃用の高射装置です。<br>本高射機は測距儀がパッケージされており、高角砲の有効な対空射撃をサポートします。新造大型艦や、防空駆逐艦 「秋月」 型に搭載されました。 

This is the new high-angle anti-aircraft unit.

The equipment includes a range-finder, providing high-angle anti-aircraft guns with more effective anti-air capability. Newer large-scale ships and the Akizuki-class anti-aircraft destroyers have the unit pre-installed.

==Notes==

'''Unbuildable'''.

Stock equipment of [[Fubuki]] Kai Ni and [[Maya]] Kai Ni. Can be upgraded from [[Type 91 Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]], and upgraded into [[10cm Twin High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]] or [[12.7cm Twin High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]], through [[Akashi's Improvement Arsenal]].

Enables [[Aerial Combat#Anti-Air Cut-In|Anti-Air Cut-in]] when equipped along with a high-angle mount (main or secondary) (e.g [[12.7cm Twin High-angle Mount]]) or [[Type 3 Shell]]. Cut-in rate increases when an Air Radar is also equipped.
