[[File:2015SpringEventBanner.jpg|Announcement! Operation 11]]

==Introduction==
The (currently ongoing) Spring 2015 Event ''Order! Operation 11'' [発令！第十一号作戦] started on April 28th, 2015 and will end on May 18th. The event will be based upon the planned Japanese Operation 11.

Like the [[Winter 2015 Event]], it has selectable difficulties: Operation A (Hard), Operation B (Medium), and Operation C (Easy). This difficulty will be 'locked in' after you complete a map, and your choice of ships is frozen for several maps. This is a long (6 map) event, and though the maps were foretold to be relatively difficult as compared to previous events, the overall response has been that they are rather easy.

'''Update notes''' (From the official twitter)
*1. Launch of KanColle's 2015 Spring Event: Limited-time-only map areas:
**The limited-time-only maps of the KanColle 2015 Spring Event "Operation No. 11, Launch!" will be implemented through the ongoing update. Since this marks the 2nd anniversary of the game, this year's spring event will last for approximately 20 days.
*2. 2015 Spring Event: Main operations (first half of the event):
**"Main Operations (first half of the event)" will consist of the following four map areas:
***1st map: Preparation for Operation No.11
***2nd map: Second Curry Ocean Operation
***3rd map: Bagel Bay Transport Destruction Battle
***4th map: Final Battle! Ri Lanka Island Invasion
*3. 2015 Spring Event: New Kanmusus:
**There will be a grand total of 3 new Kanmusus appearing in the Main operations. You can obtain the [[:Category:Unryuu_Class|Unryuu-class]] standard carrier "[[Katsuragi]]" by beating E2, and you can obtain the Western Kanmusu  "[[Littorio]]" through beating E4.
*4. 2015 Spring Event: New Kanmusus, cont'd:
**Along with the 2 Kanmusus introduced above, in the first half of the event, there is a chance you can obtain [[:Category:Yuugumo Class|Yuugumo-class]] destroyer [[Takanami]] in all event maps.
***NB! You can obtain her through (presumably) beating boss nodes of the latter half of the main operations.
***NB! Depending on the location within the event map, your odds of obtaining her drastically changes (again, presumably higher on boss nodes)
*5. About the newly implemented system of "[[Active Branching]]":
**Up to this point, route determination in KanColle was done by compass routing, which could be affected by various conditions such as fleet composition; however, through today's update, some maps will have "[[Active Branching]]", a routing system that allows the admiral to determine his/her fleet's route by his/her own decision.
*6. About the "[[Combined Fleet]]":
**E2 and E4 of the main operations use combined fleet mechanics. You can form a combined fleet by going to the fleet composition menu, then dragging the icon of the 2nd fleet to your 1st fleet (Main fleet).
*7. About "[[Expedition#Support_Expeditions|Support fleets]]":
**You can provide support to your fleets or combined fleets fighting in front line by using "support fleets". You can use shelling support or aerial support fleets and send them out to either of the two "support expeditions" to the event map area (pre-boss node support, boss node support) to support your fleet fighting in front line.
*8. Extra Operations (second half of the event):
**Upon clearing all maps in the "Main Operation (first half of the event)", you can participate in the Extra Operations of the event. The deadlier of Abyssals are focused in the Extra Operations, which consists of two maps. (NB: E-5 and E-6)
*9. New Kanmusus (cont'd):
**In E-6 of the Extra Operations, separate from the earlier 3 Kanmusus introduced, [[Roma]] will be obtainable by beating nodes.
***NB! Depending on the location within the event map your odds of obtaining her drastically changes (again, probably hinting that she is more likely found by boss or pre-boss nodes).
*10. 2015 Spring Event: New Kanmusus (tot. 5)
**Also, for admirals whose fleets complete all the Spring Event maps, seaplane tender "[[Akitsushima]]" will join the fleet. Although her combat ability isn't top quality, let's welcome her to the fleet! In summary, there will be a total of 5 new Kanmusus appearing in this year's Spring event.
*11. About "Difficulty Selection":
**In the spring event maps of "Launch! Operation No. 11", each maps will feature three tiers of difficulty that can be selected by the admiral.
***NB! All admirals can participate in "Operation C" (Easy).
***NB! Higher level veteran admirals can participate in "Operation B" (Medium) or "Operation A" (Hard).
*12. (For admirals doing A- or B-tier difficulties) About difficulty locking:
**Some maps will give sortie stamps on Kanmusus who sortied out to the map. The Kanmusus with these stamps are unable to participate in any other event maps that will give sortie stamps. Please keep this in mind.
***NB! This includes E3, E4, and E5.
*13. New BGM implemented:
**The main theme of the first half of the event operations "Fight of the [[:Category:Mutsuki Class|Mutsuki-Class]] Destroyers" and the boss node theme "Combined fleet, to the West" have been implemented. Also, the extra operations have a BGM with the Abyssal threat as its motive. Please look forward to it!
*14. New equipment implemented:
**Along with the new Kanmusus introduced in the spring  event, the new equipment "Type 2 Flying Boat","[[381mm / 50 Triple Gun Mount kai]]", "[[OTO 152mm triple extended machine gun]]", "90mm単装高角砲", "90mm単装高角砲" have been implemented.
*15. The Type 2 Flying Boat is a item you can earn if you take time to train Akitsushima to kai.
**.

==Mechanics==
===Participation requirements===
* Must have a 75% sortie win ratio.
* Must have 5 empty ship slots for new ships.
* Must have 20 free equipment slots.

{{clr}}
===Special Mechanics===
# The difficulty system from the [[Winter 2015 Event]] is present, with three levels: Operation A (Hard), Operation B (Medium) or Operation C (Easy).
#* However, you must have cleared at least Operation A or Operation B on the previous map to access Operation A (Hard) difficulty for the following map for E-3 and later maps.
#* The difficulty you select will affect most rewards (including experience gain and ship drops). The only exceptions are ''ships rewarded as map clear bonus''. 
#* Once you clear a map on a difficulty (besides easy), you will be locked on that difficulty.
# The ship-locking mechanic will have full sway in this event:
#* Ships used in E3 cannot be used in E4 on medium or hard.
#* Ships used in E3 or E4 cannot be used in E5 on medium or hard
# E2, E4, and E6 use the [[Combined Fleet]] mechanic.

**Accompanied by the [[Light Cruiser Demon]] weaker variant on Hard mode's final kill.
*5 kills required on all difficulties.
*Sparkling is advised, as this is inexpensive with light ships.

*Rewards upon clearance: 
** Clearing on Hard (甲): Mamiya, Irako, Furniture Fairy, [[Prototype 51cm Twin Cannon]]

|branching = 
*Node B is a non-combat [[Active Branching]] node; .
*Node D is a submarine node.
*F and C have LoS checks to reach the boss node; this is relatively low (Reports indicate that 38 or above will clear this), so equipping radars on all of your DD and a recon plane on your CL will suffice.

}}
|tips=
*Use a light fleet. Compositions that work:
** CLx2 DDx4 provides for four high-evasion DDs which have a likelier chance of dodging incoming attacks.
** CLx3, DDx3 could provide more firing power, however.
*Between the north and south routes, south is preferred (Yes, you get to choose). 
**The north route only has one battle before the boss but the node has considerably stronger ships, such as elite and flagship CLTs.
**The south route has four subs in one node that come in at either echelon or line abreast, so they are relatively harmless (the flagship sub has moderate accuracy in echelon, however). The second node has very weak and easy-to-clear ships such as I-class (the DDs you clobber in 1-1 for sparkling).
***The sub node does not cost you ammo; only fuel.
*Your composition for the final kill should remain the same.
*Refer to this [[User:Remi_Scarlet#E1_Hard|example fleet]] for composition and equipment suggestion.

*Be aware of the [[Light Cruiser Demon]] in one of node D's formations.
*Node C is a submarine node; however, unlike other event submarine nodes, you do use up ammo at this node.
*Boss node has a [[Battleship_Ta-Class|Ta-class battleship]]
*Possible formations:
**CA, CAV, DDx3, CLT - Provides enough firepower to comfortably take out boss node and the DDs should have high enough evasion to mostly dodge any incoming attacks. Enemy ships mostly consist of light ships like DDs, CLs and CLTs. This formation lets you conserve your CVLs if you don't have many. Keep mind you'll likely need up to 6 CV(L)s for E4 and E5. You can use mostly lower-tier ships in this map and save your best DDs and the like (one player cleared with 3 of DesDiv6 as their DDs).

**(F)BB x4, CV, SS - The SS will protect your fleet in the dangerous I night-battle node and even '''divert Anchorage Water Demon's daytime firing'''; suggested equipment is a torpedo and a damecon; two damecons can also be used. Double damecons will work as you might expect - damecons can activate on two separate nodes.
** (F)BB x2, CV, SS, Route-fixing Mogami-class pair - This setup will allow route-fixing for full damage on boss node.
*Equip [[Sanshiki]] on your BBs and CA(V)s to help damage the boss. Boss is an installation-type. 
*Being sent to the maelstrom node really hurts as likely by the time you make it to the boss, your fleet's fuel will be completely depleted if you hit node F as well. Consider turning back if sent to Maelstrom depending on your resources, especially if you want to conserve.
**Consider sacrificing a BB/CA(V)'s daytime artillery spotting in exchange for a Radar. A radar on CV may also be useful.

*[[Combined Fleet]]
*Ship-locking does not apply to this map; that is, you can use any ship you own, regardless of whether you used it in any other event maps.
*Boss: [[Battleship Water Demon]]
*Requires 7 kills to complete on Hard (甲) and 8 kills on Normal (乙)/ Easy (丙).
*Rewards upon clearance:
** Clearing on Hard (甲): [[Akitsushima]], [[Type 2 Flying Boat]], [[FuMO25 Radar]], 2 Medals, 1 Hard Medal
** Clearing on Medium (乙): [[Akitsushima]], [[Type 2 Flying Boat]], 2 Medals
** Clearing on Easy (丙): [[Akitsushima]], Medal
*This is the only map during this event where [[Roma]] is available. ('''''Drop only''''')

|branching =
* Nodes E and F are [[Active Branching]] nodes.
* Nodes I an J are night battles.
* M to O is a LoS check.
* The route you take will determine what branching rules apply to node L; bringing a sub through the north route is not recommended.

|tips = 
*The Carrier Task Force mitigates damage and sends you to Node D; branching to H is recommended as the southern route contains a night battle against a torpedo squadron led by [[Heavy_Cruiser_Ri-Class#Flagship|CA Ri-Class Flagship]] followed by a day battle against [[Battleship Princess]], both of which can be devastating.
*A mixed-speed Surface Task Force sends you to node F, giving you a choice between the middle route containing [[Anchorage Water Demon]] but with an extra [[Roma]]-dropping node (K, hard difficulty only), or the northern route containing a night battle node against a [[Battleship Princess]] and a day battle against a torpedo squadron.
*A fast-speed Surface Task Force fleet is first sent to A ({{fuel}} maelstrom) then (if not sent to C) given the same choice as the Carrier Task Force. Without question, this is '''NOT''' recommended as the fuel loss will result in you evading less attacks at pre-boss and boss nodes, reducing your combat capability.
*For final run attempts:
**With equipment designed for night battle activating, the northern route is not very threatening; [[Battleship Princess]] typically will only inflict scratch damage on your ships, and no other enemy ship in that node is equipped with DA/CI setup. Thus, a mixed-speed Surface Task Force fleet going northern route usually only has to worry about pre-boss node and the boss node; it also conserves your escort fleet's strength, with the trade off being more damage to the first fleet.
**A Carrier Task Force fleet going through the middle route can also work. You can put 3 CLTs in the fleet in this case, so your first fleet should more likely be able to focus on the boss because your escort fleet should (ideally) clean up the other mobs.
**Boss node has AS on final run attempts ([[Aircraft Carrier Princess]] on Hard and Normal, [[Standard_Carrier_Wo-Class#Flagship|Wo-Class Flagship]] on Easy).
*Node M (Pre-boss) contains an [[Aircraft Carrier Princess]] (so Hard and Normal final runs see her in back-to-back nodes).
*Example compositions:
**(F)BBx3 CVLx2 CAV, CLTx2 CL CA DDx2 (Surface) [Note that you need to be mixed-speed]
**(F)BB(V)x4 CA(V) CV, CL CLTx2 BB/CA DDx2 (Surface) [alt. composition]
**BBx2 CVx4, DDx2 CL CLTx3 (or DDx2 CL CA CLTx2) (Carrier)
*Consider using a shelling [[Expeditions#Support_Expeditions | support expedition]] to assist with the boss kill.
**Boss does not have AS prior to last kill, so a carrier support expedition may also be useful.

<nowiki>#艦これ</nowiki>
|EN = The Spring Event is almost here. The event period will be about 20 days, so keys to clearing the maps will include (a) don't jump right into event maps, (b) rounding out the fleet's operational capability in regular maps, and (c) increasing the ship's experience. Please keep that in mind!
