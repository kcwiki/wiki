==Introduction==
熟練搭乗員で構成された「零式艦上戦闘機52型」装備の艦戦隊です。<br>
零戦の最終的な量産機となった「52型」は、後継機の開発が遅れたため、後期の艦上戦闘機の主力として奮戦することになりました。<br>
熟練搭乗員の巧みな操縦技術で、機材の質的劣勢をカバーします。

Ship based Type 52 Zero Fighters piloted by skilled pilots.
The Type 52 was the last mass produced model of the Zero Fighters and due to the development delays of its successors, it continued to be the backbone of the carrier fighter force.
The skills of the skilled pilots will cover for the technological inferiority.

== Historical Information ==
The '''Mitsubishi A6M5 ''Zero''''' (''Type 0 Carrier-based fighter, Model 52'', Allied reporting name "Zeke") is the final mass-production (and perhaps most effective) variant of the Mitsubishi A6M.

Compared to the A6M2, the A6M5 had shorter wings and revised control surfaces while an improved exhaust system and cowling increased power delivery. Carbon-dioxide based fire extuinguishers were added while the radio was updated. The A6M5 had a number of incremental updates throughout its various manufacturing lots.

Maximum speed was increased to 565km/h at 6,000m and it could reach that altitude in just over 7 minutes. Subvariants include the [[Zero Fighter Type 52 Type C (601 Air Group)|A6M5c]], while the A6M6 and [[Type 62 Zero Fighter-bomber|A6M7 (Model 62)]] were adapted from the A6M5.
