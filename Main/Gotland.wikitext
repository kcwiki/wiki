'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''
* She has accuracy and firepower bonuses when equipped with certain medium guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority (Kai): '''Medium-High'''

* A four slot Swedish light cruiser, similar to [[Ooyodo]], who brings lots of flexibility to the fleet.
* For example, the extra slot allows her to perform powerful OASW attacks despite her ASW stat not being anything special, and turns her into an hard-hitting attacker against enemy installations when fitted with two [[WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)]].
* Her excellent anti-air stat of 102 also makes her a choice for dealing with enemy bombers, even though her unique [[Anti-Air Cut-In]] isn't generally worth using over the standard one.


Andra: '''very low'''

She gains the ability to equip Autogyros and Daihatsu-Class Landing craft and gets larger plane slots. This will make her a better choice for Transport Combined Fleets, Expeditions and Anti-Installation Warfare than before. However, costing a Prototype Flight Deck Catapult and Blueprint make it hard to recommend the remodel for these rather incremental improvements.


====Recommended Roles====
* Anti-air
* Anti-installation
* ASW
