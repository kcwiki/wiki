===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''

:At first remodel, she has low firepower and decent torpedo stat, making her hitting harder in night battle than at day, but not great at either.
:While not impressive in combat, do keep in mind than many maps require you to bring at least a few destroyers for routing.

:Furthermore, destroyers are cheap to deploy and can equip [[Drum Canister]], making them suited for expeditions.
:In particular, Asakaze and her sister ships consume a little less ammo than your average DD, therefore increasing net resource gain.

:Due to her decent ASW stat, Asakaze can perform OASW at high-but-before-marriage levels with proper gear.

:No further remodels have been implemented for her yet (as of January 2020). 


====Recommended Roles====
* ASW
* Expeditions

====Not Recommended Roles====
