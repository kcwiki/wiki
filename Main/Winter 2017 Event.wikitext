==Introduction==
The Winter 2017 Event '''Reconnaissance Force Emergency Deployment! Operation "Hikari"''' began on February 11, 2017 and ended on February 28th, 2017. 

The theme of this event is based upon the Ogasawara Islands and "Operation Hikari", the IJN's planned reconnaissance of and raid on the USN base at Ulithi Atoll. 

The event is a small-scale event, featuring only 3 maps.

While the event is centered around "Operation Hikari", specifically operations taking place in Nanao Bay, the Ogasawara Islands, and at the Ulithi atoll, the follow up operation of "Operation Arashi" is not part of this operation.

==Historical Background==

'''Disclaimer: The following information is based upon a summary of World War II history and may not have any influence with the game itself. This is for historical reference only.'''

The Winter 2017 event is based upon two various operations.

E-1 and E-3 are based upon Operation Hikari, which was a transport operation by the submarines [[I-13]] and [[I-14]]. Their mission was to transport disassembled Saiuns to an ad hoc air base on Truk Atoll, where they would be used to scout the USN positions within Ulithi Atoll.

E-1 represent the Nanoa Haku Bay area in the Japanese shoreline which [[I-13]] and [[I-14]] conducted a training practice prepare for Operation Hikari

E-3 represent Operation Hikari itself (with some slight historic difference as Tanaka stated in his interview)

E-2 represents the Ogasawara Islands, which served as part of a defense point for the IJN during WWII. Destroyer were often assigned to transport supplies to the islands. This also was the same location in which [[Matsukaze]] sunk at.

==Information==
===New Ships===
#[[Matsukaze]] - Reward for E-2 clear. A Kamikaze-Class Destroyer that served alongside [[Asakaze]] and [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/825520396451471360 sank] in a transport operations off of Chichijima, Ogasawara Islands after being attacked by a Submarine.
#[[I-14]] - Reward for E-3 clear. A [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/827316908768710656 submarine capable of carrying seaplanes] that successfully took part in Operation Hikari. 
#[[I-13]] - E-3 drop. Comptiq Magazine revealed that the Twin Sister of the sub that partook in Operation Hikari would also be available in this event. 
#[[Fujinami]] - E-2 drop. A new Yuugumo-class Destroyer.

===New Equipment===

*[[Saiun (Disassembled for Transport)]]
*[[Submarine Radar and Waterproof Periscope]]
*[[Submarine Radar and Radio Direction Finder (E27)]]
*[[Saiun (East Caroline Air Group)]]
Also, while not new equipment, this is the first time [[Zuiun (631st Air Group)]] is available outside of rank rewards.

===New Enemy Vessels===

*[[Abyssal Twin Princesses]]

===New Enemy Equipment===

*[[Abyssal Submarine Floatplane]]

===Event Requirements===
A minimum of two [[Saiun]] are required for E-3 on Normal and Hard difficulties. This only applies to players intending to tackle this part of the event on Normal or Hard difficulty. This was originally revealed over a week ahead of time through the official Twitter account<ref>https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/826956081691701249</ref>. Players on Easy difficulty only need [[Type 97 Torpedo Bomber|Type 97 Torpedo Bombers]] for this segment of the event.<ref>https://twitter.com/kancolle_staff/status/830362901412065280</ref>. In both cases, the planes are used to make [[Saiun (Disassembled for Transport)]] for delivery during the transport step.

This latter segment of the event was initially not available, being enabled from '''12th February 2017''', 2300 JST onward. <ref>https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/830778720554094592</ref>

==New Quests==

Upon reaching E-3 and selecting a difficulty you will be given a series of quests that you will be given to do based upon the difficulty of the map you play on. During the Transport Phase, there are two kinds of quest that only one will be given to based upon the difficulty you choose. Plan accordingly as each quest will require you to do different things depending on the difficulty.

Following this, during the Boss kill phase as your fleet depletes the HP bar for the [[Abyssal Twin Princesses]], you will eventually receive a quest that will be given to you once the HP is low enough to perform the final kill against the [[Abyssal Twin Princesses]].  Upon completing this quest, the Himes will weaken and become easier to deliver the final kill.

==Mechanics==
===Participation requirements===
*Must have a 75% sortie win ratio.
*Must have 5 empty ship slots for new ships.
*Must have 20 free equipment slots.

===Special Mechanics===
#The difficulty system first used in [[Spring 2015 Event]] returns: you can choose between Operation A ({{lang|ja|甲}}, Hard), Operation B ({{lang|ja|乙}}, Medium) or Operation C ({{lang|ja|丙}}, Easy).
#*Choosing A or B requires certain HQ Level (HQ Lv 35 for B / 80 for A in Spring 2015 Event).
#*'''An [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/799627450279804928 important note] to all Admirals intending to clear the event on Hard difficulty - further (new) conditions now apply:'''
#**When switching difficulty from ''any other difficulty'' to Hard, the map's debuff mechanism (where applicable) will be reset.
#***Switching between any other difficulties will not reset the debuff mechanism.
#The debuff system of [[Summer 2015 Event]]'s final map, where certain nodes had to be killed to reduce boss armor, returns. The mechanic is featured in the final map, but is believed to lower the armor of the boss escorts instead of the boss. ('''For more details, consult [[Winter 2017 Event#E-3|E-3]]''')
#Additionally, there is a quest-based debuff that targets the E-3 boss' armor. ('''As above, see [[Winter 2017 Event#E-3|E-3]]''')
# Operation A ({{lang|ja|甲}}, Hard) and Operation B ({{lang|ja|乙}}, Medium) will require you to have a minimum of two fleets ready due to fleet locking ('''see above for details''')

|tips = *'''Important Note:''' Upon depleting the TP gauge, you will need to complete the map one more time in order to actually finish it
*'''Recommended Compositions:'''
**No (F)BBs are allowed on this map.
**4-6SS(V)
***Using all submarines can make the map relatively easy and will reduce the gauge very quickly.
***On lower difficulties, 4SS can make it through the map relatively unharmed. 
***LBAS strikes should be focused on node B.
***There are no LoS checks for this map.
**For people who lack the subs needed 
***0-1CAV 1-2CL, 3-4 DD 0-2 SS(V)
****Good for map clearing up till the final run
*'''Final Run Composition:'''
**1CA(V), 1CVL, CL, 3DD
***Since you're facing additional battles in Wo-class Nodes, additional air defence is required.
*'''Post Clear Run Composition:'''
**1CA(V), 2CL, 3DD
***Can be used for post-clear run and evades Node D.
*TP Gauge on this map is depleted based upon the type of ships you bring (submarines seems to have the most impact) and the number of Zuiun and Seiran seaplane bombers you have equipped in your fleet (which also aid in depleting the TP Gauge).
*Once you pass '''Node I''', you can safely advance even with ships at red health, as the nodes after that do not involve any more battles.
*On the final run, the map will change its routing and your fleet will encounter more battles where you'll face more carrier battles and air attacks unless you follow the requirements to prevent being sent to Node D. <br>
'''Recommended LBAS Attack locations:'''<br>
'''Node B''' and '''Node I'''
*Use All Torpedo Bombers or Land Based Attack Aircrafts
**If using an all-Submarine team, it may be advisable to deploy your LBAS to Node B.
**If you're aiming to farm Node I you may want to eliminate the surface ships so your fleet has a better chance for S-rank.

|tips = 
*Since this map is a Transport Operation, it's recommended to bring ships that can carry [[drum canister]]s, [[Daihatsu]], and even [[Kinu|Kinu Kai Ni]] if you wish to deplete the gauge faster. 
*'''Recommended Compositions''' 
*'''Transport Escort Combined Fleet''' 4DD 2CAV + 1CL, 3DD, 2CA
** '''+''' Depletes TP Gauge Faster
** '''-''' Will require you to go through tough nodes to reach the boss node
** '''-''' Route change at final stretch makes completing map even more harder for this fleet.
** '''-''' May Require Boss Support to ensure A Rank.
**Fleet takes route ADEHKM up until the Boss Gauge reaches until Transport Gauge reaches 25% of TP points remaining. 
**Upon the Transport Gauge reaching 25% left, the '''routing path will change''' to ADEHJHKM (Yes, you get sent to H twice)
**You can choose to change your path by going to G to avoid this problem and go via route ADGJHKM.
**It's strongly recommended to only use this up until the gauge is at 25% then switch to '''Carrier Task Force'''.
**Consider having [[LBAS]] Target Nodes H and M to ensure the safety of your fleet.

*'''Transport Escort Combined Fleet using Historic Fleet Setup''' 1-4 Mutsuki Class (consisting of [[Satsuki]], [[Nagatsuki]], [[Fumizuki]] and [[Minazuki]]) DD, 1-2 Kamikaze-Class DD, 0-2,  2CAV (Or BBV if equipped to Turbine/Engine combo to fast) + 1CL, 3DD, 2CA (Depends on Difficulty read below)
** '''+''' Depletes TP Gauge Faster
** '''+''' Goes Easiest Possible Routing
** '''-''' Will still face some challenges along the way (though far less painful)
** '''-''' May Require Boss Support to ensure A Rank.
** '''Historic Fleet Setup''' will allow you to above the more intense nodes in the map allowing for your fleet to improve thier chances of survival by going CFIJKM
**Upon the Transport Gauge reaching 25% left, the '''routing path will change''' to CFIJHKM.
** Depending on the Difficulty, the number of historic ships required will be different and based on a point system. '''Kamikaze-Class DDs count for 2 points''' while '''Mutsuki-Class Destroyer Division 22 members count for 1 point'''.
** 3 Points are needed for Easy, 4 Points are needed for Normal, 5 Points is needed for Hard.
** Node I consist of a torpedo squadron fleet, [[LBAS]] is recommended to minimize damage from that node.
** You can bring BBV in place of the CAVs in the main fleet if you [[Improving Ship Speed|improve their ship speed]] using a turbine and Boiler combo. While this will allow for you to bring a tougher fleet, it may also handicap your BBVs unless you have an [[Reinforcement Expansion]] to allow them to be able to perform double attacks.
** It also will make you perform two shelling rounds in the main fleet which may be counter productive in certain nodes.
** [[LBAS]] is also Recommended for Boss Node.
**Boss Support Fleets are recommended as they'll help aid in making sure you'll gain more A rank wins in the fight.

*'''Carrier Task Force Composition''' 3-4 CV, 0-1 CVL, 0-2 DD, 0-2 CA + 1CL, 3DD, 2CA
** '''+''' Stronger Fleet capable of going through most fights with less issues, and can make easy work of the boss node.
** '''+''' Makes battles with tougher nodes easier
** '''+''' Recommended to use when TP Gauge is below 25%
** '''+''' Preferred for farming the map 
** '''-''' Will have to face lots of Carrier Battles
** '''-''' Will deplete TP Gauge far less
**It's recommended to not bring BBs of any form into this composition as they will throw you in into back up to the north resulting in your fuel and ammo being depleted by the time your reach the boss node.
**You can use [[LBAS]] to concentrate their attack on the boss node.

*'''[[LBAS]] Recommendations'''
* 2-3 Torpedo Bombers/ Land Based Attackers + 1-2 Fighters
**A Distance of 6 is required to reach the boss node.
**Depending on the Combined Fleet you use you use, you may wish to need to change up the number of fighters and Torpedo bombers/ Land Based Attackers needed to minimize the loss of your plane's rank in battle.
**It's commonly recommended to use 3 Torpedo Bombers/ Land Based Attackers and 1 Fighter if you use the Historic Transport Fleet Set up.
**It's also recommended to use 2 Torpedo Bombers/ Land Based Attackers and 2 Fighter for all other set ups.
*The boss fleet will only change to its Last Dance pattern when you reach the boss node with a fleet that would completely deplete what remains of the Transport Bar with an S-Rank.

The following map will consist of two phases consisting of a '''Transport Phase''' and a '''Boss Kill Phase'''. In addition, the difficulty you play on this map will greatly effect certain factors regarding what you'll need to do for the event map.

*'''Transport Phase'''
**The Transport Phase of the Operation will consist of transporting new pieces of equipment ([[Saiun (Disassembled for Transport)]]) to the transport drop off point (Node E and then beating the boss in Node I.
**The requirements needed to make [[Saiun (Disassembled for Transport)|Disassembled Saiun]] will vary depending on the difficulty you choose as quest you'll need to do will vary.
**Please refer to the [[Winter_2017_Event#New_Quests|Quest area for additional information]]
**Before taking [[Saiun (Disassembled for Transport)|Disassembled Saiun]] it's recommended that you attempt to test the map to make sure you will be able to safely transport [[Saiun (Disassembled for Transport)|Disassembled Saiun]] without issue.
**If you fail to reach the boss node, your flagship gets heavily damaged, or you take a  get off routed after you reach node E, '''you will loose all your [[Saiun (Disassembled for Transport)|Disassembled Saiun]] and will need to redo the Disassembled Saiun quests again''' to attempt to complete the TP portion.
* In order to complete the Transport gauge, you'll need to transport 2 [[Saiun (Disassembled for Transport)|Disassembled Saiun]] and score an A at node I.

*'''Recommended Composition'''
* 1-2SSV,0-5SS(V)
** '''+''' Completely evades Node B
** '''+''' Completely dodges all Air attack nodes
** '''-''' Cannot handle the boss node on thier own without lots of support
**Max Expertise planes are required to ensure that you'll take out a good number of the enemy ships in the area.
**Boss Support Fleet Highly recommended for Node I. 
** To ensure the  [[Saiun (Disassembled for Transport)|Disassembled Saiun]] are delivered to their destination and count to your TP Gauge, you need to score an A rank at least at Node I.
**LoS of 5.5 is needed to reach the boss node (equivalent to 2 Shiun or 2 Type 0 Observation Planes with 3 Stars)'
**Note that on Hard Mode Ha-Class Late Model Elites are present at the boss node which are fully capable of performing Preemptive ASW on your subs.
**It is possible to very efficiently grind levels for submarines to get them to SSV by running node C and retreating.
*'''Non Sub based Composition'''
* 1CL,3DD,2CAV
**  '''+''' Currently the only non sub based composition known to make it to the boss node for players who lack the subs to do the above path.
** '''+''' Completely evades Node B on Easy 
** '''-''' Makes other surface battles possibly difficult
** '''-''' Will require In-Route and Boss Support for survival. 
** '''-''' Will be forced to go through Node B on higher difficulties.
**This composition is good for players who lack the subs to do the sub based composition. But is only recommended for easy mode.
*Once you complete this part of the operation, a new path opens up and you'll be able to gain access to the next phase of the operation.
*Your Land Base Air Squadrons will also be accessible for the later part of this operation.

*'''Boss Phase'''
*During this phase, your objective will be to eliminate the [[Abyssal Twin Princesses]] the following compositions are known to work

*'''Recommended Compositions'''
*4FBB, 2CVL, + 1CL, 0-2CA, 2-3DD, 0-1FBB, 0-2CLT (CLT and CAVs with a [[Prototype Seiran]] Preffered in Escort Fleet)
** '''+''' Takes the Shortest Path to the Boss Node as long as all ships are Fast.
** '''+''' Recommended for taking care of multiple objectives and also taking care of the boss node.
** '''-''' Will only be able to use 2 CVLs which will hinder likely result in you using them as pure fighter carriers just so your fleet can achieve air partiality in the worse case scenario. 
*4BB (V), 2CVL, + 1CL, 0-2CA(V), 2-3DD, 0-1FBB, 0-2CLT (CLT and CAVs with a [[Prototype Seiran]] Preffered in Escort Fleet) (Normal Mode or Lower Only)
** '''+''' Recommend for Normal Mode or Lower.
** '''+''' Takes the Shortest Path to the Boss Node.
** '''+''' Recommended for taking care of multiple objectives and also taking care of the boss node.
** '''+''' Can some what utilize other planes in the CVLs if BBV are brought in with seaplane fighters / bombers.
** '''-''' Cannot be used on Hard Mode without being taken through a path. 
*2FBB, 4CV, + 1CL,0-2CA(V), 2-3DD, 0-1FBB, 0-2CLT (CLT and CAVs with a [[Prototype Seiran]] Preffered in Escort Fleet)
** '''+''' Will ensure Air Superiority against the Boss Fleet.
** '''-''' Will however have to take a longer path resulting in having less fuel and ammo by the time your reach the boss node.

*The [[Abyssal Twin Princesses]] have an [[Armor Reduction]] mechanic which will allow you to be able to defeat them and their fleet much more easily.
**The following conditions must be completed for the initial debuff Mechanics.
*** S Rank '''I Node''' and '''J Node'''
**Upon Completion, there will be a chance in the Twin's dialogue indicating they have been weakened.
*'''Recommended Compositions for node I'''
* Single Fleet: 1FBB, 2 CV, 1 CA, 2 CLT
** '''+''' Can easily take out the boss node.
** '''-''' Can deal with some nodes easily
** '''-''' Will be forced to fight Node B
*Fleet In route Support and LBAS is recommended for Nodes B,D, and I Carefully spread out your attacks accordingly to where you need them the most.

*'''[[LBAS]] Recommendations For I Node Post Transport'''

**4 Land Base Attackers/Torpedo bombers on both Squadrons
**Due to having a very low AA strength, you can safely attempt to take on the boss node by trying to eliminate as many of the enemy the ships there as you can during the LBAS support phase. And to some extend Node B and D. If you feel uncertain add in 1 Type 52 Fighter.

*'''Recommended Compositions For Node J'''
*Surface Task Force: 4FBB, 2CVL, + 1CL, 2CA, 2DD,1FBB
**Bring [[Type 3 Shell]]s and [[WG42]]s or [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank]]s to aid in battle. 
**Light Carriers should be mainly fitted with mostly fighter planes
**Concentrate all [[LBAS]] Attacks on Node J.

*'''[[LBAS]] Recommendations For J Node'''
**2 Land Base Attackers/Torpedo bombers + 2 Fighters on both Squadrons
**Concentrated Attacks may help in removing some of the [[Artillery Imp]]s and other smaller fleets making the fight easier for your surface fleet when they have a chance to fight back.
*Once both I and J are completed  with an S rank you should hear a '''Quest chime''' sound upon returning to your base indicating that you met the requirements to the debuff.

*'''[[LBAS]] Recommendations For U Node'''
**2 Land Base Attackers/Torpedo bombers + 2 Fighters on both Squadrons 
**2 Land Base Attackers/Torpedo bombers + 2 Fighters on first Squadron and 3 Land Base Attackers/Torpedo bombers + Fighter 
**This will likely ensure a stronger chance of doing serious damage against all the enemy abyssal in the combined Fleet. But can be risky as the Land Based Planes may possibly loose rank if they are unfortunately to loose all their planes.
**The main  objective will be to take out the Wo-class on Easy or Carrier Himes in the back on Normal and Hard Difficulty so your fleet can have a better chance on focus on the boss and gaining possibly Air Superiority. 

*'''Final Kill Debuff'''
**There is a second Debuff for the final kill phase of the event where you'll need to complete a quest in order to weaken the [[Abyssal Twin Princesses]] for the final kill. 
**You will need to visit Node J 2 more times and score an S rank twice and complete the quest. 
**Once completed the [[Abyssal Twin Princesses]] will be weakened for the final kill.
**Note: This Debuff is '''highly recommended''' for completing the event map as attempt to attack the deliver the final kill on the twins will be very difficult.
**If the quest is not completed during when thier HP bar is at the Final Kill point, you will need to score '''2 consecutive kills''' in order to fully defeat them. One to bring them down to thier weaken state (660 HP) and one to deliver the killing blow. Failure to complete this step, will reset thier HP to 800. 

*'''Hidden Weakness to the [[Abyssal Twin Princesses]]'''
**Arming a ship that will be performing an attack with a [[Type 93 SONAR]], [[Type 3 SONAR]] or [[Type 4 SONAR]] can actually allow them to perform bonus damage against the boss. 
** A Basic example of set up for this for a DD would be 2 Main Guns + 1 Sonar or 2 Torpedoes + Sonar.
**Using a combination like the mentioned above mention should do 1.3x the normal damage against the [[Abyssal Twin Princesses]].

*'''SS(V) Levelling'''
**The first node of the transport phase (Node C) is an air battle node that gives the flagship between 350 to 450 exp per run with every S-Rank. Since submarines automatically complete air battle nodes without taking any damage, this is an easy way for them to gain experience. Send a single SS(V) to that node and then retreat immediately after the battle animations and results screen. The morale loss should be negligible as the flagship will always attain MVP status, and the amount of fuel / ammo used is also very low.
