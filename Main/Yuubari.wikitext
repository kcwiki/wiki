===Analysis===
'''Yuubari Kai'''

Priority: '''Medium'''

:A four slot light cruiser, who can't equip seaplanes and is therefore unable to perform [[Artillery Spotting]] but brings more flexibility than average to the fleet.
:For example, the extra slot allows her to perform powerful OASW attacks despite her ASW stat not being anything special, and turns her into an hard-hitting attacker against enemy installations when fitted with two [[WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)]].

'''Yuubari Kai Ni'''

Priority: '''Low'''

:An anti-air focused remodel, she gets a fifth slot, a big AA boost, the ability to carry large RADARs, and her own [[Anti-Air Cut-In]].
:Also, a base Luck stat of 30 allows for mildly reliable cut-in attacks at night.
:However, said AACI isn't worth using over the generic one, and she has access to further remodels which keep the excellent five slots but possess more interesting capabilities.
:This remodel, which is also required to proceed with the following ones, requires a [[Blueprint]] and an [[Action Report]].

'''Yuubari Kai Ni Toku'''

Priority: '''High'''

:Her second remodel increases her her Torpedo stat, but more importantly allows her to use midget submarines to perform a preemptive torpedo strike like a CLT while still being classified as a CL, allowing her to be used where [[Kitakami]], [[Ooi]] and [[Kiso]] would not be allowed.
:She can also be loaded with tanks and [[Daihatsu]], making her a very versatile ship, to be used to increase expedition income or making her even better at attacking enemy installations as alternatives to her anti-surface role.
:As a trade-off, she loses speed and is now classified as Slow, but isn't a big drawback as she has five slot and a single [[Improved Steam Turbine]] is enough to fix her speed if needed.
:Also, a base Luck stat of 30 allows for mildly reliable cut-in attacks at night.

'''Yuubari Kai Ni D'''

Priority: '''Medium-High'''

:Five slots, the ability to perform OASW attacks innately and equip large SONARs plus a good ASW stat boost make her the strongest anti-submarine ship in game so far, able to hit enemy subs like a truck by fully leveraging ASW synergy bonus and by simply having more slots.
:The only reason she's not listed as higher priority is that her above-mentioned Toku remodel also exists, albeit veteran Admirals might want to raise a second Yuubari.
:Also, a base Luck stat of 30 allows for mildly reliable cut-in attacks at night.
