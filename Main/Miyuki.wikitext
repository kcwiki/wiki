===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''

:At first remodel, she has low firepower and a decent torpedo stat, making her hitting harder in night battle than at day, but not great at either.
:While not impressive in combat, do keep in mind than many maps require you to bring at least a few destroyers for routing.
:Furthermore, destroyers are cheap to deploy and can equip [[Drum Canister]], making them suited for expeditions.

:No further remodels have been implemented for her yet (as of January 2020).

===Important Information===
* Reward for B5.
* An option for F76 and F77.
