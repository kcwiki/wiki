==Introduction==
呉海軍工廠砲熕部で開発された初の純国産戦艦主砲です。<br />
16インチ（40.6cm）を僅かに上回る、この41cm砲は「大和」型の46cm砲が登場するまで世界最大の戦艦砲でした。<br />
これを搭載した「長門」「陸奥」は、当時世界列強の「ビッグ7」として、多くのファンに称えられていました。

Developed by Kure Naval Arsenal's Artillery Division, this is the first entirely domestic battleship gun.<br>
At a little over 16 inches (40.6cm), this 41cm gun was the largest battleship gun in the world until the introduction of the Yamato-class' 46cm guns.<br>
It was equipped on Nagato and Mutsu who it was praised by many fans as two of the great power's "Big 7". 



Developed for the IJN's first 'Eight-Eight Fleet Program' in 1910, in which Japan initially intended to build eight battleships and eight armored cruisers. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 scrapped the various plans for other ships to carry this gun, leaving the Nagato-class as the sole class. 

==Note==
Buildable. Stock equipment of [[Nagato]] (And Nagato Kai), [[Mutsu]] (And Mutsu Kai) and all [[:Category:Kongou Class|Kongou-Class]] Kai and Kai Ni.
