==Trivia==
Developed for the IJN's first 'Eight-Eight Fleet Program' in 1910, in which Japan initially intended to build eight battleships and eight armored cruisers. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 scrapped the various plans for other ships to carry this gun, leaving the Nagato-class as the sole class.
