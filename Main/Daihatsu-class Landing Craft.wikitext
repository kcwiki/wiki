==Notes==
*'''Unbuildable.''' 
*Stock equipment of [[Akitsu Maru]], [[Abukuma|Abukuma Kai Ni]] and [[Ooshio|Ooshio Kai Ni]]. 
*Increases expedition resources gain by 5% for each equipped Landing Craft, up to 20%. Increase is multiplicative with bonus from Great Success.
**When modifying a Daihatsu through [[Akashi's Improvement Arsenal]] you can improve the resource gain .05% per star, upon reaching it's max you can gain .5% per daihatsu. In addition, this modification to your daihatsu can increase expedition gain past the natural 20% cap that you can get using 4 daihatsu.
*Beginning with the event of [[Fall 2015 Event|Fall 2015]], Transport Operation maps were introduced. Daihatsu have a use in event waters where they can be used to help aid in depleting points from the TP gauge to complete an event map. ''For details see [[Transport Operation#Equipment TP Value]]''
*Ranking rewards for January 2014.
* Equipping these with a combination of a WG42 will add bonus damage against enemy installations where amphibious warfare mechanics apply (I.E 6-4)
