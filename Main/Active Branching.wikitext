=Overview=

Active branching was introduced in the [[Spring 2015 Event]]. It is a [[Combat/Nodes#Non-Combat_Nodes|non-combat node]] that allows you to pick which direction you would like to proceed. Active branching primarily shows up in [[Events]].

Upon hitting an active branching node, a text bubble will appear above the fleet icon saying '''"You can select the fleet's course!" (艦隊針路選択可能！)'''. Nodes that you are able to select will glow. Clicking on the node will send your fleet in that direction. 

* Appears in [[World 4#4-5|4-5]], [[World 5#5-3|5-3]], [[World 5#5-5|5-5]], and [[World 6#6-3|6-3]].
* Can affect routing in subsequent nodes. E.g 4-5H has a routing rule depending on if you passed through D or not.
