==Gameplay Notes==
===Special Mechanics===
* Able to perform special AACI on Kai Ni. Please see [[Anti-Air Cut-In]] for more details.
* Able to equip torpedoes and perform closing torpedo at Kai Ni C.
* Able to equip seaplane fighters at Kai Ni C.
* She gains a '''night battle''' special attack on Kai Ni C that targets 2 enemies at random: 
** Activation requirements are as follows:  
*** Hiei Kai Ni C must be Flagship.
*** Kongou Kai Ni C or Kirishima Kai Ni are the second ship.
*** She must not be more than <span style="color:gold;">'''lightly damaged (小破)'''</span>.
*** The escorting BB must not be <span style="color:red;">'''heavily damaged (大破)'''</span>.
*** '''Line Ahead''' needs to be selected in a single fleet OR '''Cruising Formation 4''' for a combined fleet.
** It can only be activated '''once per sortie''' and only if '''no other special attack was triggered in the same sortie'''
** The attack will consume extra ammo from both participating battleships when triggered. The total ammo consumption will be x1.3 of the original ammo consumption of when the attack is triggered, hence:
***If it is triggered in day battle, it costs 6% extra ammo.
***If it is triggered in an night battle node, it costs 2% extra ammo.
***If it is triggered in a night battle in a normal node, it costs 9% extra ammo.
** Multipliers and activation chance increase are tbd at this point

'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''
* She has accuracy bonuses and penalties when equipped with certain large guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
'''Hiei Kai'''

Priority: '''High''', unless many more fast battleships are available.

:A Japanese fast battleship that's easy to come across for her class.
:Her stats are decent but nothing to write home about.



'''Hiei Kai Ni'''

Priority: '''Low'''

:This second remodel improves her stats a bit and that's it.
:There's no reason not to take it but no reason to rush it either, generally.



'''Hiei Kai Ni C'''  

Priority: '''Low'''
:This further remodel comes with a torpedo fitting, allowing her to equip torpedoes and perform closing salvos like cruisers or destroyers, and also increasing her night battle potential. 
:She also unlock a special night battle combined attack, which further underscores her new niche.
:Keep in mind that this remodel requires 2 [[Blueprint]].


====Recommended Roles====
* Surface combat
* Night battle (Second remodel C)

===Important Info===
* Required for unlocking the 4th fleet slot.
* Required for quests A16, A40, A52, B44, and B128

==Trivia==
*She is named after [[wikipedia:Mount Hiei|Mount Hiei]].
*She was disarmed and turned into a training ship in 1929 before serving as Emperor Hirohito's transport from 1930 to 1937 when she was rearmed.
*Hiei is the only one of the Kongou sisters having to have her superstructure mast reconstructed into a prototype similar to that used on the ''Yamato''-class.  Her slightly higher armor and health compared to her sisters can likely be attributed to this.
*She received her Kai Ni on 20/11/2013.
*Sunk following the [[wikipedia:Naval Battle of Guadalcanal|Battle of Guadalcanal]] on November 14, 1942; she was the first IJN battleship ever to be lost in WWII.
* Wreck possibly found by Dr. Robert Ballard in 1993. There is discussion as to whether the wreck is her or [[Kirishima]].
* She appeared in the first Kancolle Drama CD, also dubbed One Nao show, along with other characters in a mini skit. Link to show: https://soundcloud.com/masapusan/one-nao-show (TL is included in comments). She also appeared in the anime with Kongou, Haruna and Kirishima.
