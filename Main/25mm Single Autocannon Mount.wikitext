==Introduction==
標準的な対空機銃兵装です。後期の艦艇のほとんど全てが装備した機銃です。命中しない…すぐ加熱する…等の評価もありますが、雲霞のように迫りくる敵機から味方艦艇を必死に守りました。銃身の過熱を防ぐため、連装、三連装タイプも生産＆配備されました。

This is the standard anti-aircraft machine gun. Most late naval vessels were equipped with this machine gun. These were used to protect against attacks from enemy aircrafts, but later evaluation shown they were subjected to overheating. In order to prevent the issues of the barrels overheating, the [[25mm Twin Autocannon Mount|twin]] and [[25mm Twin Autocannon Mount|triple]] barrel variation are produced and deployed.

==Notes==
Was originally introduced as a rank reward item 2/3/2014.

On March 11th 2016, the 25mm Single Autocannon Mount became available via construction. 

*Unlike most items that are construction in [[Akashi's Improvement Arsenal]], the 25mm Single Autocannon Mount is currently the only equipment that uses only 1 screw from 0 - +10.
