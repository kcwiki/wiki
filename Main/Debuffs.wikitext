=Overview=

Debuffs are an event mechanic that was introduced during the [[Summer 2015 Event]]. Every event since then has had debuff mechanics at one or more maps. Debuffs can either be a '''reduction in the boss' armour''' or a '''damage bonus'''. It has been more common for debuffs to be of the latter type. The damage bonus can apply to just the boss node or across the whole map depending on the event. Given how much variation there are in debuffs, please refer to '''the latest event page''' for information.
