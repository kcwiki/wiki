==Introduction==
The '''Summer 2016 Event''' ''"CounterAttack! The Second Battle off Malay Peninsula!"'' is planned to start on '''August 12, 2016'''. As of current, information regarding the event was revealed during the 3rd Kantai Collection Naval Review Meeting set for '''August 7th''' at Yokohama PACIFICO Convention. The Event is planned to feature a mixture of surface combat, Anti-Submarine Warfare, and the usage of [[Land-Based Air Squadron]]s.

The event is noted to be a CounterAttack / Intercreption Operation that will have you battling against the Abyssal Fleet in an disadvantaged situation on a what if battle that will be loosely based upon the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_Prince_of_Wales_and_Repulse Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse] based on the details that were given so far from the Naval Review and Comtiq Magazine.

Additional tweets have noted that the event will have you conducting ASW patrols with torpedo squadrons and aviation units performing transport operations for the First part of the campaign. The Second Half of the campaign will be using combined fleets and your main fleet forces for an interception/counter attack along with Land Based Air Squadrons against the main Abyssal Forces in the western part of the Ocean.

Taking this information into account, we can expect this event to use all of the major event mechanic elements it has used up to this point which include:
*[[Combined Fleet]]
*[[Transport Operation]]
*[[Land-Based Air Squadron]]
*[[Armor Reduction]] (Strong possibility)

==Information==
===New Ship Girls===

===Participation requirements===
*Must have a 75% sortie win ratio.
*Must have 5 empty ship slots for new ships.
*Must have 20 free equipment slots.

===Special Mechanics===
# The difficulty system first used in [[Spring 2015 Event]] returns: you can choose between Operation A ({{lang|ja|甲}}, Hard), Operation B ({{lang|ja|乙}}, Medium) or Operation C ({{lang|ja|丙}}, Easy).
#* Choosing A or B requires certain HQ Level (HQ Lv 35 for B / 80 for A in Spring 2015 Event).

**5 kills (900 HP) to clear on Hard

*Key Rewards:

** Clearing on Medium (乙): Mamiya; Irako x2; [[Battle Rations]] x2; [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tanks & Marines)]]; [[Type 1 Land Attacker]]
** Clearing on Easy (丙): Irako; [[Battle Rations]]; [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft]]; [[Type 96 Land Attacker]]

|0 -> B = * At least 2DD and 2 or less CVL 

|B -> E = * FBB + 4 DD or SLOW fleet?
|B -> D/empty = * No FBB + 3DD AND fast fleet?

|tips = <br />
*'''Need around 30 LOS to guarantee Boss routing'''. Reports of 24 LOS show that some routings direct the fleet to node H. Greater than 15 will allow the possibility of Boss routing.
*1 CL 5 DD will route to BDFG.
** This should avoid going onto an extra battle.
*1-2 CL 3DD 1CVL will easily clear LOS with a [[Saiun]] on the CVL. This also routes to BDFG, assuming a fast CVL (any ''except'' Hiyou, Jun'you, Houshou, or Ryuuhou).
* 1 FBB 1 CL 4DD will route to BEFD and face the weak surface fleet there. This allows for a second round of attacks on the boss, though at a lower fuel and ammo level.
** ASW power is affected by equipment stats only and not by aircraft quantity size, Zuihou and Shouhou are ideal ASW CVLs if you're looking to save your CVLs for later maps. (Not counting their opening airstrike)
**With a >> Seaplane on a CL, around 30 LOS can easily be achieved.
* Nodes B and F are sub nodes.
* Remember that CTs (Training Cruisers) are '''SLOW''', and may be negatively affected by branching at B node
* Slow BB(V)s and any CVs are ''not'' allowed on this map.
** ''FBB''s are allowed. They will route B to E or C, depending on the other ships in the fleet..
*Node G has transports, so it is good to clear the transport quest.

** Clearing on Medium (乙): [[Reinforcement Expansion]], Furniture Fairy, [[Type 3 Fighter Hien]]
** Clearing on Easy (丙): Furniture Fairy

*This is a [[Transport Operation]] --Not a combined fleet
**Hard mode requires only 400 Transport points to clear (340 for Medium)

*There is a drum check (at least 1 drum required) and a LOS check to get to the boss.

*As with all [[Transport Operation]]s, you only need to score an A rank on the boss node to be able to deplete the TP gauge, though scoring an S-rank on the boss will deplete it faster.
*Bringing plenty of [[Daihatsu]] will deplete the gauge quickly
*If you have [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tanks & Marines)]] bring them as well since they'll give out more points compared to normal [[daihatsu]].
*In-Route Support will help you minimize the damage you'll take along the way to the boss node.
*While unnecessary, a good enough boss support fleet may be used to guarantee an A-rank.
*While 1CL 5DD will take the fleet down the western route, it has trouble gaining enough LOS to get to the boss node (1 recon plane + 2 radar 33 passed the LoS check)
*1BBV 1CAV 1CL 3DD is recommended, but you have to enter an extra BATTLE node.
*1CAV 1CL 3DD 1AV is recommended if you want to skip the extra node
*You can consider deploying [[Land-Based Air Squadron]]s along with an Akizuki-class DD to help remove the CVL's planes on pre-boss node to minimize the damage from them.
*Seaplane fighters are recommended for some of preboss nodes which have CVLs
*Node A is a good location to train planes; have a fleet of a single submarine and launch your planes against that node.

*Favorable branching options are available by using ships from the '''Malaya Historical Fleet''', i.e. [[Kongou]], [[Haruna]], [[Choukai]], [[Mogami]], [[Mikuma]], [[Suzuya]], [[Kumano]], [[Yura]], [[Kinu]], [[Fubuki]], [[Shirayuki]], and [[Hatsuyuki]]
**Information regarding the use of this composition can be found here. <ref>https://twitter.com/cal_aty/status/764265760046710784</ref>
:It's hypothesized that having at least three of each of the above in each fleet is required for superior routing, with at least seven of the named ships in the combined fleet as a whole.
*Node B is a sub node.
*Node D is a land-based airstrike.
*The boss is an installation-type, as such, bringing landing forces, [[WG42]]s and AP (strong against artillery imps) or [[Type 3 Shell]] (against Supply Depot Hime) is advised.
**On hard, it is the [[Harbor Princess|Summer Harbor Princess]], [[Supply Depot Princess]], Two Artillery Imps and two destroyers in line ahead formation.
**Do consider the use of CAVs instead of CAs in the escort fleet for their ability to equip and use [[WG42]] in combination with [[Type 3 Shell]].
**Consider concentrating as much air strikes as possible from your [[LBAS]] as possible on the boss node since it'll help wipe out some of the installations.
** Recommended [[LBAS]] comp for boss node attack:
** 2 fighters with a distance of 5 minimum and Land Attackers for both squadrons. (for concentrated damaged on installation damage)
** If you lack in Land Based Attackers, use 1-2 fighters and Torpedo Bombers (which aren't as effective, but still strong)
** Using 1 fighter and 3 bombers is an option for the third airbase, if you choose to use it for attack
**Boss Support is useful, especially on the final kill, but not required
*There is a method to do [[Armor Reduction]] against the Z Force Fleet of Node H, which while isn't required, will make things easier for admirals. In order to complete this process you need to do the following:
**Score an S-rank at node A
***This requires using under 3 historical ships in ''either'' fleet, a Surface Task Force, at least one slow ship, and no AVs.
**Score an S-Rank at Node D, routing here can be accomplished in two ways:
***Using either under 2 historical ships in ''each'' fleet
***Not using Kongou and Haruna in the first fleet (which routes to E) '''and''' using under 5 historical ships total (which routes to E). One such way is to create a CTF using 3CV and one CVL 
**Successfully '''completely''' intercept an Air Raid against your Land Base. (Take '''ZERO''' damage from the Air Raid to your Land bases)
:Completing this step result in a quest completion "ding" sound that will be heard upon returning to base, this indicates you have successfully completed the debuff and the Z Force Fleet of Node H will become easier to defeat now.
*As a small trivia piece, Force Z (Node H) is named and designed after the historical [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Z Force Z], which comprised the Prince of Wales, Repulse, and four escorting destroyers.

[[File:2016Summer E4 L Node 210816.png|right|thumb|200px|Node L Branching flowchart]]
*Node L features a complicated branching rule that has a determined list of priorities that will decide which way you'll go if you have certain ships in the fleet. (see flowchart)
*Due to the Distance your [[Land-Based Air Squadron]]s must travel to reach the boss node, you will need to prepare to use a [[Type 2 Flying Boat]] or [[PBY-5A_Catalina]] on each squadron you wish to attack the boss node.
**If you need to send a land base Air Squadron to the boss node you will need a Distance of 9. You can use Fighters and torpedo bombers with a range of 6 and [[Type 2 Flying Boat]] which will extend it's reach to 9.
**[[PBY-5A_Catalina]] can only extend the reach by 2 meaning any planes used from there will need to have a range of 7
**In any case, the boss node on hard possesses two Tsu or Tsu-Elite CLs, making running air support here a risky proposition
**If you lack the planes to travel that distance, it's recommended to target Node I with Land Attackers and fighters since a [[Harbor Princess|Harbour Summer Princess]] and [[Supply Depot Princess]] is present at that node, allowing your fleet to reliably survive that node with minimal damage taken

====Boss Debuff====
*Debuffing the boss requires S-ranking nodes '''four of the five''' nodes C, D, H, I, and K. After returning to the naval base, you will hear the quest completion sound, and the boss's voice line will change.
** Surface Task Force is needed to reach node C for [[Armor Reduction]]. 
** Carrier Task Force is needed for Node D and H [[Armor Reduction]].
** To complete node I requirements for the [[Armor Reduction]], it's recommended to assemble a concentrated attack using Land Attackers and fighters on that node, along with bringing anti-installation equipment, before retreating.
**Nodes C,D,H,I are generally considered the easier nodes to complete for the [[Armor Reduction]] method. 

====Installation Node I====
*During the boss runs, it's highly recommend to concentrate your [[LBAS]] attacks on Node I. Land-based bombers in particular have a tendency to be strong against installations such as [[Supply Depot Princess]], greatly reducing the chances of you having to face both princesses at once.
**Sending a fighter with your bomber waves is highly recommended.
**[[Harbor Princess|Summer Harbor Princess]] and [[Supply Depot Princess]] count as carriers for shelling purposes (even though they have guns), as such, they cannot attack in the day if they are out of planes or if they are at moderate damage (they can still attack at night, though)
====Night Battle Node K====
*Line Ahead formation has been proven to have the highest accuracy overall, and is generally never a wrong choice <ref>http://kankoregouchin.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-37.html</ref>
*Echelon formation has been shown to provide a marginal, but likely insignificant, increase in evasion in battles starting at night; which comes at the cost of a severe and significant accuracy penalty. <ref>http://kankoregouchin.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-37.html</ref>
**As a general rule, it's usually preferable to disable or eliminate enemies before they can fire than it is to have a slightly higher chance of evading them
*A searchlight provides an accuracy and cut-in bonus to your fleet while reducing enemy cut-in rates, but also confers evasion penalties to the ship carrying it (who is also targeted more often)
**Multiple searchlights do not stack with each other
**A starshell confers the same bonus as a searchlight, but without the evasion and targeting penalty, in return, it does not always trigger. As with searchlights, the effect of multiple starshells will not stack, however, each one triggers independently, and carrying multiples will increase the overall chance that at least one will trigger.
====Boss Node Q====
*By the time you reach the [[Heavy Cruiser Princess|Summer Heavy Cruiser Princess]] and her boss fleet using the shortest path to reach her, your fleet will have only 5% fuel and 30% ammo. 30% ammo results in a 60% total damage modifier on all your attacks (after deducting enemy armor).
**Bringing Hayasui is a possible option for this map, placing her in escort fleet with torpedo bombers allows her to shell near the daytime cap (crucially, escort fleet planes do NOT take part in aerial combat and are hence NOT shot down). 
**Nonetheless, it is possible to deliver the final kill regardless of whether you choose to do so.
*For taking down the [[Heavy Cruiser Princess|Summer Heavy Cruiser Princess]] it's recommended to have a good number of fleet members who can perform torpedo cut-in attacks.
