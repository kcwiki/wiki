==Introduction==
The '''Spring 2016 Event, "Deployment! Land-based Aerial Division!"'''  started on May 2nd, 2016 and while it was orginally planned for 3 weeks, it has been extended  all the way to '''May 31st, 2016''' due to several bug issues. The entire event will be a '''"What if" Operation''' that will involve constructing an Airfield Land Base which will be used to launch '''Land Based Planes'''. The event is a large scale operation which will consist of 7 stages that will be divided up into 3 different operations, a main operation, an extra operation and a late Operation. 

The event plans to introduce the new '''"[[Land-Based Air Squadron]]" System''' which will introduce new Land Based planes such as the Type 1 Land Bomber and the the Type 96 Land Bomber.

In addition, the event will be the first time an event will branch into two separate operations which can be done at the same time once you complete the main operation. The Extra Operation (E-5) is considered an optional operation to complete, while the Late Operation is a continuation of the main event (E-6 and E-7)

This event also served as the first time the debuff mechanic would be actually expand over several stages of the event in order to debuff the bosses armor for one location (namely E-5 and E-6 to debuff E-6's [[Central Princess]])

*[[Central Princess]] - E7 Boss

==Mechanics==
===Participation requirements===
*Must have a 75% sortie win ratio.
*Must have 5 empty ship slots for new ships.
*Must have 20 free equipment slots.

===Special Mechanics===
# The difficulty system first used in [[Spring 2015 Event]] returns: you can choose between Operation A ({{lang|ja|甲}}, Hard), Operation B ({{lang|ja|乙}}, Medium) or Operation C ({{lang|ja|丙}}, Easy).
#* Choosing A or B requires certain HQ Level (HQ Lv 35 for B / 80 for A in Spring 2015 Event).
# There is a 4 way ship lock in this event.
# [[Transport Operations]] introduced in [[Fall 2015 Event]] return
#* For transport maps, you need to deplete the TP gauge instead of a HP gauge, depleting the TP gauge only requires an A rank or better and does not require the boss to be sunk.
# This event introduces the [[Land-Based Air Squadron]] mechanic for E4 to E7.

==Event Maps==
===Quick Info Table===

The Upcoming event will feature a new branching mechanic which will allow players to branch off from the main operation once it is complete. This will lead to players being able to access the both the Latter Operation and the Extra Operation. Players will be able to choose which operation they want to play. The following example listed below is a rough speculation and will be changed once the event goes live.

* 3DD + 1CL + 2CAV starts A - C, avoiding the enemy CV at B.  From there you can choose E - H - I - G - J, avoiding F, which contains enemy BBs.
* Alternatively, you can use 1 BB + 1 CVL + 1 CAV +1 CL and 2DD to go through B - E - F - G - J. This method is is good for farming for [[Akizuki]] and [[Teruzuki]] and other rare ships at Node F but present a high risk to reach the boss node. In route support might help make it through it through mode F if you aim for the boss.
*You may swap one CAV for a CVL.
* [[WG42_(Wurfgerät_42)|WG42s]], [[Daihatsu-class_Landing_Craft_(Type_89_Medium_Tanks_%26_Marines)|Daihatsu with Marines]], and [[Type_2_Ka-Mi_Tank|Amphibious Tanks]] provide damage bonuses against Artillery Imps and [[Supply Depot Princess]].
* A destroyer with two main guns and either WG42, Marines, or Tank, can destroy an Artillery Imp in night battle but is less effective against the Imp in day battle.
* A destroyer with a WG42 and either (or both) Marines and Tank, will be strong against the Imps in both day and night battle because the bonuses stack.
* On Node G if you're having issues with the PT Imps on the map, consider using the double line formation as it'll improve your accuracy against them.
* In-route Shelling support and Boss Shelling Support (for final kill) is '''highly recommended'''.
:*Boss support is only recommended for final kill because of the uncertainty of pre-final kill boss formation.
* Since Supply Depot Princess's Damaged (Corrupt) form has either 480 HP (hard/easy) or 430 HP (medium), and her regular form 600 (all difficulties), it is possible to finish the map without ever seeing the final form of the boss (unlike [[Winter 2016 Event#E-2|E-2 of Winter 2016 Event]]). This is possible when there is 481~600 HP left on the gauge on hard/easy or 431~600 HP on medium.

* If you're gunning for boss, do not bring a slow ship as you will run out of fuel before you reach boss.
* Part of the calculation (specifically the equipment and ship components) for the eventual TP drain is done the moment you reach the drop-off point (in this case, node G), so having to use [[Fleet Command Facility]] before you reach node G will reduce the (potential) TP drain. On the flip side, you can pull ships out after node G and not affect the TP drain (of course, it'd make the boss fight a little bit more difficult).
* Overloading equipment for TP isn't beneficial if you cannot score wins consistently. It's much better to score S-rank consistently with fewer TP equipment.
* Enroute support fleet is '''highly recommended''' (borderline required) for higher difficulties due to the CLT Chi-Class Flagship (Torpedo value of 140)at node F capable of easily wrecking your second fleet if they get to launch closing torpedo salvo.

*Composition:
:*A surface task force is recommended if you're aiming to conserve bauxite, as E-6 and E-7 are both bauxite-draining (E-5 to a certain degree).
::: Recommended composition: 1FBB+2fast CVL+3 (Any, preferably not CA or CAV) / 1CL+3DD+CA+CLT
:*A carrier task force doesn't go through the Battleship Princess which could create problem. Air supremacy shouldn't be an issue with CTF.
::* Recommended composition: 2FBB+3CV(L)+(CA or CV/L) / 1CL+3DD+1CA+(CA or CLT)
::* Bring someone capable of performing AACI when using CTF.
:* If you're playing on Normal or Hard mode, try to use what forces you used in E-1 that you can for E-4 to conserve as much of your fleet as you can.
* If the Heavy Cruiser Princess proves to be problematic on last kill, bring a support fleet to make things easier.
:* On final kill, she has increased HP (increased from 350 to 370/380/390 on easy/medium/hard) and armor (increase of 13: from 145/175/195 to 158/188/208), so proper arrangement of equipment and firing order (in the second fleet) must be addressed.
::: On hard, destroyers cannot be counted on to finish the boss while using a double-attack equipment setup. Consider bringing torpedo cut-in.
* [[Land-Based Air Squadron]] Usage:
:* For this map, the recommendation is to load your airfield with only fighter planes and sent them to the node(s) with threatening enemy carriers.
::* For STF, this means node I focused as no other nodes on the bottom route has any carriers.
::* For CTF, the recommendation is usually F node once, and either F (again) or D.

* You can elect to do E-5 anytime after you complete E-4; E-6 (and E-7, if E-6 is completed) is accessible without completing this map.
*: As rewards for E-5 doesn't directly help with E-6 (cannot use [[Land-Based Air Squadrons]]), but E-6 can give you a land attacker (if cleared on hard), for people attempting E-6 Hard anyway, it might be useful to finish that map first. Note that '''Node I''' here is one of the debuff nodes for E-6.
* Recommended Fleet Compositions: 
** 1 CA + 1 CAV + 4DD / 2CAV + 4DD: Fleet will take no ammo penalty when reaching boss, but will require fleet support, especially enroute support.
** 1 AV + 1 CA/CAV + 1CL + 3 DD: This takes the route as the one above, trading stability at boss for better chance at keeping the fleet intact going into boss.
**: The AV shouldn't be [[Akitsushima]] (can't use [[Type A Ko-hyoteki]] and small plane slots).
** 2BB/BBV + CAV/CA/[[Akitsu Maru]] + 3 DD: Will have to go through node E, but otherwise the threat of enemy torpedoes are much lower as you get a second round of shelling for all enroute nodes. Can bring Akitsu Maru, but she might be more useful in E-6.
* Both in-route and boss support are highly recommended to increase the chance of getting into boss / increase the likelihood of successfully downing the boss, respectively.
* This map will involve Enemy Air Raids which you'll need to assign your interceptors and fighters to engage the enemy planes and try to eliminate as many as you can along the way, since they will try to do damage to your land bases, which will in turn cause your planes to become fatigued more quickly and cost a larger amount of resources to recover from the damage.
*[[Lycoris Princess]] is an Installation Type, so using [[Type 3 Shell]]s, and [[WG42]]s will help in downing her.
*Unless you bring Akitsu Maru, it'll be difficult to gain air superiority at boss. Don't bring [[Type 98 Recon Seaplane (Night Scout)]] as it might not activate depending on result of the air strength.
* [[Land-Based Air Squadron]] Usage:
:* The problematic nodes here are I, L, and M (Boss).
::* I node can be defended with a good AACI ship, but a fighter squadron sent to this node will help with lessening the damage taken.
::* L node is problematic if too many enemy ships launch torpedoes, especially if using the CA+CAV+4DD or AV+CA/CAV+CL+3DD fleet.
::* M node (boss) has good amount of air power, and depending on the results, the Ru-Class Battleships can inflict significant damage. Fighters sent here will help in reducing the air power required (on the main fleet) to achieve air stagnation.
:* Generally, the recommendation is this: 1st Airfield with all fighters, and 2nd airfield with mixture of fighters/attackers, and your targets are between the 3 nodes above.

*Unlike most maps, this map has a debuff strategy to the [[Central Princess]] which players will need to rearrange thier fleet to complete the following objectives:
** S-Rank Node A
**Recommended Fleet
*** Main Fleet : 4 CVL
*** Escort Fleet : 1 CL + 5 DD (full ASW setup)
** S-Rank Node G
**Recommended Fleet
***Main Fleet : 2 CV(B) + 2 BB(V) + 2CA
***Escort Fleet : 1 CL + 2 fBB + 2 DD + CLT/CA
** S-Rank Node L
***Main Fleet : 3 CV(B) + 2 BB(V) + 1 CA
***Escort Fleet : 1 CL + 2 fBB + 2DD + CLT
* In addition, scoring an S-rank at Node I of E-5 will also contribute to the debuff.
* Completing 2/4 of these requirements will result in the [[Central Princess]] having a small change in her dialogue which will result in your fleet being able to do extra damage to her from that point onward.
* Completing all 4 requirements will result in the [[Central Princess]] debuff to take full effect.
*Unlike previous events, the debuff effect on [[Central Princess]] does not seem to ware off once activated.
** Recommended Fleet for Boss
***Main Fleet : 2CV(B) + 2 BB(V) + 1 CA + Akitsumaru
***Escort Fleet : 1 CL + 2 CA + 2DD + CLT
*[[Central Princess]] is vulnerable to any form of air attacks (coming from Support Fleets, Aerial Phases), but most specifically noted to take extra damage from dive bombers and seaplane bombers. It's possible to take out [[Central Princess]] before the shelling phase actually begins. Do keep in mind carriers equipped with Dive bombers will only attack non-land based Abyssals during shelling phase.
* It's recommended to use a carrier boss support fleet for the Boss node and to have your carriers armed with Dive Bombers, as the effects from the dive bombers once the debuff is in full effect can lead to doing very high damage if not killing off the [[Central Princess]].
* Air Superiority is highly recommend to ensure the land bombers and dive bombers can land the killing blow [[Central Princess]], otherwise chances of it happening are less likely.
*Some suggest equipping Aviation battleships with a Zuiuns and Type 3 shells may result in high damage on the [[Central Princess]] if the attack connects during the Aerial Phase.
*It's recommend that anyone that brings dive bombers should make sure thier dive bombers are double Chevoron to ensure the highest chance you'll be able to land the killing blow on the [[Central Hime]] if they aim for her.
*Since the reward difference between normal and easy is only improvement materials, there is not a lot of reason to do E-6 on normal unless you plan to do E-6 normal then E-7 hard, and only if you don't plan on doing E-6 hard.

*Boss: [[Central Princess|Central Princess (Damaged)]]
*Kills required: 7 kills on all difficulties
*Reward: [[Iowa]]
** Clearing on Hard (甲): Skilled Pilot, Medal x2, Hard Medal
** Clearing on Medium (乙): Skilled Pilot, Medal x2
** Clearing on Easy (丙): Medal
|tips = 
* Use CTF, ~440 Air power.
* Load land bases with 1 Fighter 3 Bombers in each air group and concentrate all attacks on the boss.
* Ignore Air Defense, it doesn't really do anything.
* Using the FCF during chipping runs is highly recommended due to how often node L will Taiha one of your ships.
* Use 2 CAV with 2 Main Guns, 1 WG42 and 1 Sanshiki to maximize damage against installations. 
* When using CTF, your planes must have a flight radius of 6 in order to target boss. 7 for STF
* Carrier Boss Support and Shell In-Route Support is '''highly recommended'''
* Carrier Boss Support should be armed with 3 Torpedo Bombers and 1 Fighter
* CVs and Armored CVs need to be armed with torpedo bombers along with fighters to help maximize chances to deliver devastating blows against the abyssal boss fleet. Since [[Central Princess]] is no longer weak to airal attacks and support fire from dive bombers like she was in E-6 this is the recommended direction to go. 
* On harder difficulties, especially on hard, this may take a long time to properly exexcute as the boss will be much harder to take down.
* If you are a long time player who happens to own a lot of the rare planes from previous events and have completed most of your quest there is a recommended composition for your land base Air Sqaudron that can allow for your fleet to do the maximum amount of damage on the final kill which goes as follows:
** '''First Land Based Air Sqaudron:''' Type 3 Hien 244, Type 1 Land Attacker Nonaka Squadron, Tenzan 12 Murata Squadron, Tenzan 12 Murata Squadron
** '''Second Land Based Air Sqaudron:''' Reppu Kai Iwamoto Squadron, Type 1 Land Attacker, Type 1 Land Attacker, Type 1 Land Attacker
** '''Third Land Based Air Sqaudron:''' Reppu 601 Squadron, Type 96 Land Attacker, Ryuusei Kai, Ryuusei Kai
*By setting up your planes this way during the final kill you will be able to have a squadron that should be strong enough to minimize the chances of them getting completely shot down and maximize your chances of delivering as much damage as possible against the [[Central Princess]] and her fleet.
*If you are running low on bauxite or do not have a large amount of resources it is highly recommended to use a STF and be prepared to use [[Hayasui]] in your fleet conduct a '''P2W strategy''' on the final which will likely complete the boss kill much faster.
*It's recommended that [[Hayasui]] should be bring 2 [[Maritime Resupply|Maritime Resupplies]] with her which will give a big enough boost to your fleet's fuel and ammo by the time they to the boss node that they will have a fair chance at fighting the [[Central Princess]].
*For STF, it may be recommended to bring Akitsushima, 4 BB, 1 Armored CV + 1CL, 2DD, 1 FBB, 1CA/V, Hayasui
** Akitsushima should be armed with a Type 1 Floating Boat and Seaplane Fighter if possible, BBs in the first fleet need AP shell set up, Armored CV should use 3 fighters and a torpedo bomber
** Use [[Ooyodo]] if possible with 2 [[WG42]]s one DD need to be a torpedo cut-in DD and the second should be an air defense DD, 1FBB should have night scout and [[Type 3 Shell]], and the CA/CAV should use a [[Type 3 Shell]] + [[WG42]] combo
