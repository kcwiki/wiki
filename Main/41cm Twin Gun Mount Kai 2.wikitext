==Introduction==
呉海軍工廠砲熕部で開発された純国産の戦艦用連装主砲、その改修改良型です。if兵装ではありますが、防御面及び射撃速度を向上、さらに射撃装置を改良、長門型主力戦艦及び改装伊勢型に最適化改修した熟成戦艦主砲兵装です。特に大規模改装後の長門型戦艦改二では、その潜在能力を遺憾なく発揮します。

''An improved version of a twin-gun main battery for battleships that was 100% domestically developed by the artillery department of the Kure Naval Arsenal. Although fictional, it's supposed be a modified battleship main armament with better plating, rate of fire, a further improved firing system, and which has been optimised for Nagato-class main force battleships as well as the Ise-class. Especially on the K2 Nagato-class battleships after their large-scale remodelling it'll unfold its full potential.''
