|origin =迅鯨型潜水母艦の二番艦、長鯨。迅鯨姉さんの妹です。少しだけ旧式ですが、最新潜水母艦が空母に改装されたので、最前線の潜水母艦に再配備されました。潜水母艦として、更に輸送任務や対空戦闘、戦いが終わった後も大切なお仕事、頑張りました。姉さん共々、忘れないでね。
|translation =I'm the 2nd ship of the Jingei-class submarine tenders, Chougei. I'm Jingei's little sister. We're a little bit outdated but because the newer submarine tenders were converted into carriers<ref>''Zuihou'' and ''Shouhou''</ref>, we were reassigned to the front lines as submarine tenders. I did all my important jobs as best I could. From being a submarine tender, to transport operations, to anti-air combat, and even after the war. Please don't forget me or my sister.
