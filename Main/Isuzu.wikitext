'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''
* She has accuracy and firepower bonuses when equipped with certain medium guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
'''Isuzu Kai'''
Priority: '''Low'''

:At first remodel, she has decent Firepower and Torpedo stat, for a light cruiser, meaning she can do [[Artillery Spotting]] with okay-ish damage at day and pack a decent punch at night, too.
:Her ASW stat also allow her to perform OASW attacks with proper setup.

'''Isuzu Kai Ni'''
Priority: '''Medium-Low'''
:Her second remodel actually ''decreases'' her anti-surface capabilities, granting her an AA stat boost but especially the best ASW stat of any light cruiser in game and the ability to execute said attack innately, albeit it won't do much damage unless she has actual ASW gear on her.
:As such, she's a natural choice to deal with enemy submarines.
:She also gain her own [[Anti-Air Cut-In]] setups, but those aren't really worth using over the genertic onces in almost any case.


====Recommended Roles====
* ASW
* Anti-air (Second remodel)

===Important Info===
* Required for A63, A66, B55, B60, and B72.
