'''Nomvember 18th, 2016''' ''The Fall 2016 Event Update''

#The [[Fall 2016 Event]] has begun.
#*The maps for the main operation (E-1 to E-3) have been added.
#**E-1: The Maritime Transport Operation
#**E-2: The Mainland Air Defense Battle
#**E-3: Announcement! The Third Fleet Operation Act!
#*Maps E-4 and E-5 were unlocked on November 19th, 2016, at around 23:35 JST.
#**Clear your cache and/or refresh your game if the new maps aren't showing up for you.
#*'''An [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/799627450279804928 important note] to all Admirals intending to clear the event on Hard difficulty - further (new) conditions now apply:'''
#**When switching difficulty from ''any other difficulty'' to Hard, the map's debuff mechanism (where applicable) will be reset.
#***Switching between any other difficulties will not reset the debuff mechanism.
#**If you are playing on Hard difficulty, it is necessary to preserve the strongest elements of your fleet for the final map.
#***Based on data that has been data-mined so far (refer to the [[Fall 2016 Event]] page), it is believed that the final map '''utilises a separate fleet-lock on Hard mode'''. Do take this into account before committing any ships to the main operation.
#*The new seaplane tender [[Commandant Teste]] will be a reward for [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/799627450279804928 completing the main operation (maps E-1 to E-3)].

#**She is confirmed to drop [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/799628709305036805 across multiple difficulties].
#*As always, equipment and items will be rewarded [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/799583559321169921 according to the difficulty selected].
#*A new Kamikaze-class destroyer will also be obtainable<!-- [[Asakaze]] -->; details to be confirmed.
#*Lastly, the Lexington-class aircraft carrier [[Saratoga]] will be obtainable as well; again, details to be confirmed.
#A [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/799635596788408321 note] to Admirals who are attempting Transport Operations for the first time:
#*There are various types of ships as well as specific ships that are best suited to performing this kind of operation. If you encounter the enemy many times, or if the amount of supplies transported is very small, consider changing the composition of your fleet for better results.
#**Equipment can also help with improving the amount of supplies transported.
#**ASW countermeasures are also important.
