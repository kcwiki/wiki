==Introduction==
急降下も可能な多用途水上偵察機「瑞雲」。<br />
伊勢型航空戦艦等での艦隊運用を前提に編成・錬成した、六三四航空部隊所属の瑞雲飛行隊です。

''"A multirole float recce plane, Zuiun was designed to carry out dive-bombing as well. This Zuiun belongs to 634th Air Group, grouped and trained for practical application on aircraft-carrying battleships such as Ise and Hyuga."''

The 634th Air Group was sort of carrier aircraft division, which belonged to aircraft-carrying battleship Ise and Hyuga (they were to carry 14 and 8 Zuiun's respectively) in the latter half of war in Pacific. The air group was initially trained to catapulted off their battleships, but later transferred to ground bases in Philippines, Taiwan as well as Japan mainland after October 1944, thus never saw an action they initially intended. 634th Air Group's mission was dive-bombing and strafing toward American vessels during nighttime, and they kept themselves clear of so-called Kamikaze suicidal attack until the very end of war (hence the higher stats, reflecting the Air Group's high skill level).
