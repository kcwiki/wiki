===Tips===
*This map will serve as your first introduction battle in the normal part of the game to [[Installation]] type Abyssal which is different from all other abyssal types as they tend to have higher armor, stronger attack power and, can't be hit by torpedoes.
*Killing the installation is '''optional''' for this map so you don't need to '''necessarily clear the map by defeating her'''. However, having a fleet that is capable of killing an installation is encourage especially for first time users of anti-installation gear to get a feel for fighting these kind of bosses. 
*As such, the following equipment should be considered if you wish to fight the [[Harbor Princess]], each of these gear are effective at penetrating the installation's armor:
**[[Type 3 Shell]] (for CAs/BBs | for beginner)
**[[WG42]] (for CL/ DD | for advance players)
**[[Daihatsu]] based equipment
**[[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank]]
<br/>
'''Recommended Fleet'''
*'''3 DD, 1 CL, 2 CVL''' routes '''DHN'''
**A Light Fleet Composition which takes the shortest path to the boss. Since you'll be limited to light ships, you will need to depend on [[Daihatsu]] type equipment and [[WG42]] to effectively fight the installation boss if you choose to bring them. You can also opt to use CVL with equipped with just Torpedo Bombers and fighters if you wish for additional assistance taking out the installation. Keep in mind though it not entirely necessary to kill the boss for this map.
*'''2 CV(B) 2 CA(V) 2 DD''' routes '''CDHN or CFHN'''
**A stronger composition than the above one, but you will fight one more pre-boss battle
**Dealing with [[Harbor Princess]] is slightly easier as your CA(V) can carry [[Type 3 Shell]] to damage her
*'''1CL 1AV 2 CVL 2 DD (All Fast)''' routes '''ABGHN'''
**Goes through the resource node on the way that yields fuel, but there is a chance of off-routing to node I instead of going to H
*'''1 (F)BB(V), 2 CV(B), 1 CA(V), 2 DD'''
**Heaviest possible fleet, but has random routing across the map (You will always start at node C though)
<br/>
'''Fuel / Bauxite Farming'''
*It is possible to use this map to farm both fuel and Bauxite. However, you need to use either an '''AV''' or '''AO''' and face off against mixed subs and a cruiser based surface fleet before being able to get the said resources
*'''Recommended Composition: 1 AV/AO 1 CL 2 DD 2 CLT (All Fast)''' routes '''ABGJ'''
**Node A shouldn't present much difficulty, however node G with its' flagship CAs, CLs and Late model DDs may present a possible challenge to survive. But if you are able to successfully do so. You can be rewarded with a decent amount of Fuel and Bauxite. 
**Preemptive torpedo launching ships like AV, CLT and CL [[Abukuma]], [[Yura]] can be useful for taking out many of the ships in node G before the battle starts to minimize damage taken
**If you use a slow AV or AO like [[Mizuho]], [[Commandant Teste]], [[Hayasui]] or [[Kamoi]], you will need to use a turbine and boiler combo to help with [[Improving Ship Speed]] so that the entire fleet is fast and avoid '''Node E''' to prevent additional ammo lost.
**Due to the danger this path has, bringing [[Daihatsu]] based equipment to gain extra resource is optional, but not recommended.
