|origin =イタリア海軍Maestrale級駆逐艦の次女、Grecaleよ。何？あんまりジロジロ見ないでよ。姉妹たちとの第十駆逐隊で、結構頑張ったのよ。みんな行ってしまったけれど、あたしは戦え抜けた。そして、戦いの後も海の守りについたの。主武装を撤去した司令艦として。覚えておいて。
|translation =I'm the 2nd of the Italian Navy's Maestrale-class destroyers, Grecale. What? Don't keep staring at me. I worked hard with my sisters in the 10th Destroyer Division. Everyone else was gone in the end but I survived the war. After the war, I continued to protect the seas.<ref>She was part of the Marina Militare.</ref> I was even disarmed to serve as the command ship.<ref>In 1959-1960 her weapons were removed and she was converted into a command ship to take over from [[Duca degli Abruzzi]].</ref> Make sure you remember me.
