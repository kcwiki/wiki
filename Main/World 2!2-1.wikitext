===Tips===
* This map is fairly simple as long as you remember that all maps in World 2 have routing restrictions on the maximum number of CV(L)s. With a limited number of these, your path to the boss is guaranteed.
<br/>'''Recommended Fleet'''
*'''1 (F)BB, 1CV, 1 AV, 1 CL, 2 DD''' routes '''C - E - D - H'''
**Good for ensuring '''you can get both an Instant Construction {{IC}} while playing through and reaching the boss node each run'''
*''' 1 CL 1 AV 4 DD''' Route: ''' C-E-H'''
** This is the shortest route possible to clear this map with only 1 battle before the boss and 1 boss battle.
** Fleet needs to be Fast. 
** The comp is very light and does not have any carrier air strike power. It can be helpful to use ships such as [[Nisshin]] and [[Yura]], as they can launch opening torpedoes as well as carry seaplane bombers.
** Replacing the AV with another DD is also possible, though this comes at the cost of air power and runs the risk of encountering an extra battle by routing '''C-D-H''' instead. It is still a viable alternative though, especially if using strong destroyers.
<br/>'''Steel and Transport Farming'''
*'''3CV/CVL, 3XX''' routes '''C - B - A'''
**Good for collecting 2 transports per run and gathering a small amount of steel
***But 2-2 is probably better for farming transports, as the 2-2 node (see below) does not include an enemy CVL and is therefore less likely to damage your fleet during the opening air combat phase. 
**Bringing additional drums and Daihatsu will help you farm additional steel.
