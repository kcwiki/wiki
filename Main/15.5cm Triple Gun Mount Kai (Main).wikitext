==Introduction==
条約下で保有制限のあった重巡を火力を増強した強力な軽巡で補うために開発された三連装主砲です。<br>射程・発射速度・運用性等のバランスに優れ、対空戦もある程度可能な傑作砲となりました。<br>後に有名な「大和」型戦艦の副砲としても採用されています。本砲は、大型軽巡などでの運用で熟成・改修を重ねた同改良主砲です。

To cover the shortfall of heavy cruisers that were limited by the Treaty, this gun was developed to produce powerful light cruisers.<br>
It is a masterpiece that had a good balance of range, firing rate and operability. It was also capable of anti-air.<br>
It was later adopted as the main guns of the famous Yamato-class battleships. This is an upgraded version of the gun that was used on the large-type light cruisers that has gone through many refinements and upgrades.
