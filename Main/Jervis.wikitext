===Analysis===
Priority: '''High'''
:A British destroyer with average firepower but an excellent torpedo and ASW stat.
:Once remodeled, she can also perform OASW attacks innately, albeit those won't do much unless she has actual ASW gear on her.
:Furthermore, a stellar base Luck of 55 allows her to perform reliable but not too powerful cut-in attacks at night.

:No further remodels have been implemented for her yet (as of January 2020).

====Recommended Roles====
* ASW
* Night battle

==Trivia==
* She is named after [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jervis,_1st_Earl_of_St_Vincent Admiral John Jervis].
* Decommissioned in May 1946
* The black stripe at the top of her smokestack serves as a visual indicator of her role as a Destroyer Leader. 
* The differences between her base and Kai CGs (most prominent in the damaged versions) reflect various changes over the course of her career. 
** While under repair in 1940 after a major collision, ''Jervis''' command was changed from the 7th to the 14th Destroyer Flotilla. However, the funnel markings on her Kai CG reflect the colors of the 7th Destroyer Flotilla (two white stripes), not the 14th (one red and one black stripe).
** Her pennant number was also updated from F00 to G00, as the letter F was being reassigned to armed merchant vessels.
