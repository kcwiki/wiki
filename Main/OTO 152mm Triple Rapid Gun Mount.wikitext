==Introduction==
パスタの国が生んだ、伝統と信頼の高性能中口径の三連装速射砲です。
砲の旋回や俯仰、砲弾の揚弾及び装填は主に電力で稼働する最新型です。
新型高速戦艦の副砲にも採用されました。

This triple extended machine gun was born from the land of the pasta, and is a traditional and reliable secondary. This machine gun is capable of spinning at a very fast rate, because of the new electricity motor that was implemented into this machine gun. The new fast battleships were eventually equipped with this new secondary cannon.
