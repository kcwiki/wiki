==Trivia==

*This Abyssal Boss would become he first abyssal boss type to introduce a new gimmick into the game known as the "Armor Crushing" system.
*Players were required to go and defeat areas around the boss in E-7 as her armor was extremely high making her almost unbeatable unless you did the following conditions:
**S rank the X node and the Y node (which had thier own Abyssal Bosses within) several times, and also destoyer many Wa-Class Transports to help aid in weakening her armor.
**By doing this, it was possible to weaken her to the point she could be killed in a battle. However if you were unable to defeat her be Midnight JST, her armor would reset and you would have to repeat the process all over again.
