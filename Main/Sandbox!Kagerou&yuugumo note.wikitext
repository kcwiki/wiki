===Analysis===
Priority:

* Kai/Kai Ni: '''Low'''
: Her Kai is just a generic DD like most others. While her Kai Ni has good stat, she requires a BP and she doesn't have other notable special gimmicks. Her low luck also restricts her use of TCI build, meaning she is only going to see use against low to medium armor surface targets. However, she and her two other sisters are required for one of the catapult quest line. 




====Recommended Roles====
* Surface target (Double attack)
* Support Expeditions

====Not Recommended Roles====
* TCI (without luckmod)

===Important Info===
* Required by quests A32, A87, A88, B21, B116 and B117.

===Analysis===
Priority:

* Kai/Kai Ni: '''Low'''
: Her Kai is just a generic DD like most others. While her Kai Ni has good stat, she requires a BP and she doesn't have other notable special gimmicks. Her low luck also restricts her use of TCI build, meaning she is only going to see use against low to medium armor surface targets. She has the highest firepower among all Kami-tank carrier DD if the type C gun bonus is accounted for, but the gap is small for her cost and she doesn't have the flexibility to equip daihaitsu as well. However, she and her two other sisters are required for one of the catapult quest line.

Kai: '''Very High'''
* She is one of the few DD with natural high luck for TCI. This, together with her low leveling requirement, makes her your staple in event map against high armor surface target until you start luckmodding. Even though she is a relatively rare ship, it is worth to deliberately farm for her in the early stage.

* TCI

===Analysis===
Priority:

* Kai/Kai Ni: '''Low'''
: Her Kai is just a generic DD like most others. While her Kai Ni has good stat, she requires both a BP and an AR and she doesn't have other notable special gimmicks. Her low luck also restricts her use of TCI build, meaning she is only going to see use against low to medium armor surface targets. She could also serve as an ASW DD with easy access to OASW, but there are cheaper options. 




====Recommended Roles====
* Surface target 
* ASW (Double attack)
* Support Expeditions

====Not Recommended Roles====
* TCI (without luckmod)

===Important Info===
* Required by quests A55, A91, B47, B126 and C23.
