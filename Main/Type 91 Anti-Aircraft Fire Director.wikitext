==Introduction==
高角砲の対空射撃用の高射装置です。<br>
高射機と高射射撃盤を組み合わせ、高角砲の有効な対空射撃をサポートします。<br>
やや、旧式ではありますが、主力の戦艦や巡洋艦などに搭載されました。

''This is the high-angle guns' director.''<br>
''The director and its firing dish together locate a target and find its best-fit firing angle.''<br>
''...somewhat. This one is obsolete, and its primary function is already built-in on battleships, cruisers, etc.''

Note: while not directly referenced by name, the formal definition of the [[wikipedia:Director_(military)|director]] is an [[wikipedia:Fire-control_system|fire-control system (FCS)]] (火器管制装置). Slightly different from radar in that the FCS/director finds a possible point in which the bullet will arrive ''at''. [http://wikiwiki.jp/kancolle/?91%BC%B0%B9%E2%BC%CD%C1%F5%C3%D6 As demonstrated on wikiwiki]:<br>
> ''Radar: "The enemy is over here!~ Here is contact!~"''<br>
> ''FCS: "Um, the enemy has exposed themselves, so I think this shot angle is good!~"''

==Notes==
'''Unbuildable'''.

Stock equipment of [[Hatsushimo#Second_upgrade|Hatsushimo Kai Ni]]. Can be upgraded into the [[Type 94 Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]], through [[Akashi's Improvement Arsenal]].

Quest reward from [[Quests#D16|D16]], and obtainable as a reward from beating the second map of the [[Summer 2015 Event#E-2|Summer 2015 Event]] on the Hard difficulty.

Enables [[Aerial Combat#Anti-Air Cut-In|Anti-Air Cut-in]] when equipped along with a high-angle mount (main or secondary) (e.g [[12.7cm Twin High-angle Mount]]) or [[Type 3 Shell]]. Cut-in rate increases when an Air Radar is also equipped.
