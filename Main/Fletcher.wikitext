===Analysis===
Priority: '''Medium-High'''
:An US destroyer with mediocre Torpedo, decent Firepower, and great AA, ASW and HP stats.
:She can perform OASW easily, and once remodeled she gains the ability to execute said attack innately, albeit it won't do much damage unless she has actual ASW gear on her.

:She also comes with an array of powerful Fletcher-class [[Anti-Air Cut-In]] attacks and the possibility (unique to US light ships so far) to perform multiple rolls for those instead of just one, making her a reliable choice for the fleet's air defense. 
:(Do note that her AACI requires two [[5inch Naval Gun Mk.30 Kai + GFCS Mk.37]] to bring out her full potential.) 
:Finally, a decent base Luck of 40 allows for mildly reliable cut-in attacks at night. However, her stat distributions means said attacks will not be able to hit hard.

'''Kai Mod II: low'''

:Minor Stat Improvement at the cost of a remodel Blueprint. Her core capabilities remain unchanged.
:Able to equip Fleet Command Facilities

'''Mk II: low'''

:Trades 2 Points of Night Battle Power for more ASW stat. Her core capabilities remain unchanged.
:Able to equip Fleet Command Facilities
:Able to equip Medium Bulges and Large SONAR

====Recommended Roles====
* ASW
* Anti-air

Her hull number 445 sums to 13, as does the Task Force 67 she was a member of at the time. Her crew elected to embrace 13 as a lucky number, and indeed Fletcher was the only American ship to escape the battle unscathed. Three torpedoes, possibly from Amatsukaze, passed under her hull during the battle. Thereafter her crew referred to her as "Lucky 13."</ref>
