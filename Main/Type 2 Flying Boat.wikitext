''This is the four-engined Type 2 Large Size Sea Plane, otherwise known as the Type 2 Flying Boat. It has a large wing like air frame, and was made for the usage of long range reconnaissance as well as providing transportation for fleet command personnel. ''
''It was a state-of-the-art plane exceeding the world standard during its time, and to this day its successors are still active flying in the seas and skies.''

==Notes==
Capable of performing ASW on its own (similar to [[Ka-type Observation Autogyro]]).

[[Land-Based Air Squadron#Combat Radius|Increases the range]] of fellow Land-Based Air Squadron planes, from +1 to +3 range depending on the base's unmodified range.

Although it is a scout which does not actually participate in Aerial Combat mechanics-wise, it is still included in the launching animation if other planes are launched.
