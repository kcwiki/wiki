==Introduction==
四発の大型飛行艇「二式大型飛行艇」、通称「二式大艇」です。
巨大な翼と船のような構造を持つ機体で、長距離偵察や司令部要員の移動等に用いられました。
同時代の世界水準を大きく超えた傑作機で、今の時代もその後継は空に海に活躍しています。

This is the four-engined Type 2 Large Size Sea Plane, otherwise known as the Type 2 Flying Boat. It has a large wing like air frame, and was made for the usage of long range reconnaissance as well as providing transportation for fleet command personnel. 
It was a state-of-the-art plane exceeding the world standard during its time, and to this day its successors are still active flying in the seas and skies.
