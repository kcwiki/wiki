===Ship Girls===
'''Resupply Fleet'''
To resupply the entire fleet, simply click one of the two "resupply all" buttons as described above. They will automatically resupply fuel, ammo and replenish any lost planes.

'''Resupply Individual'''

For more control over resupply, such as when completing quest [[Quests#E4|E4]], you may want to resupply individual ship girls. 

# Click on the check box to the left of the ship girl banner to select her.
# Choose whether to resupply fuel ({{Fuel}}), ammo ({{Ammo}}) or both (まとめて補給).

===Planes===

Planes are usually automatically replenished when a ship girl is resupplied. However, there are some cases where a ship girl has full supplies while her planes are depleted. To replenish only planes, click the '''Replenish Planes (艦載機補充)''' button.
