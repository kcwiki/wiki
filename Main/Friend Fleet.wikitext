=Overview=

Friend Fleet is an Event-only mechanic that was implemented during the [[Winter 2018 Event]]. They are '''NPC fleets''' that appear to attack the boss during [[Night Battle]] before your fleet engages. Because the exact Friend Fleet details vary from event to event, please refer to the '''current event page''' for more information.
To access the Friend Fleet Menu during the event, you may click on the [[File:Friend Fleet Button Grey.png]] button in the Homeport screen.

'''In the current implementation:'''
* They are only available on '''specific nodes''', and may "arrive" at any time from event start up to after several days have passed since the event started.
** They are typically implemented as the event progresses to give players a higher chance of beating a map.
* Only NPC fleets are available.
** The devs have mentioned that player fleets may be available at a future date.
* They will engage the '''entire enemy fleet'''.
** This means they will fight both fleets of an enemy combined fleet.
* The determination of which fleet of an enemy combined fleet your escort fleet will engage in [[Combined_Fleet#Combined_Fleet_Night_Battle|night battle]] is calculated after the Friend Fleet attack.
* Which Friend Fleet appears is '''random''', but odds can be manipulated. 
** By having a member of the Friend Fleet in the sortied fleet, all Friend Fleets that she is a member of will not appear. This is referred to as "blocking" a Friendly Fleet.
*** Some fleets are "unblockable", and may appear even if you sortie a member that is present in it.
* The stats, level, remodel, luck, equipment and damage state in which the friend fleet ships appear on is completely arbitrary.

=Using Friend Fleets=
[[File:FF_Toggle.png|400px|right]]
# Click on the '''Friend Fleet (友軍艦隊)''' button on the [[Home Port]] screen.
#* The button will be greyed out if Friend Fleets have not been implemented yet for that event.
# In the menu that pops up, changing the toggle to '''Request "Friend Fleet" (「友軍艦隊」要請)''' will activate Friend Fleets in maps that have them.
#* Take note that you cannot pick and choose which maps where the Friend Fleet appears. You'll need to deactivate Friend Fleets by toggling it to '''Support Unnecessary (支援不要)'''.
# The '''Request Strong Friend Fleets (強力友軍支援要請)''' toggle will activate <span style="color:red">'''Strong'''</span> Friend Fleets.
#* These fleets are tagged as "<span style="color:red">'''Strong'''</span>" in the event pages.
#* They cost 6 Instant Constructions {{IC}} when they appear.
#** The {{IC}} will not be consumed if a <span style="color:green">'''Weak'''</span> Friend Fleet appears.
