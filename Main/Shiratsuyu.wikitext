===Analysis===
'''Shiratsuyu Kai'''

Priority: '''Low'''

:At first remodel, she has low firepower and a decent torpedo stat, making her hitting harder in night battle than at day, but not great at either.
:While not impressive in combat, do keep in mind than many maps require you to bring at least a few destroyers for routing.
:Furthermore, destroyers are cheap to deploy and can equip [[Drum Canister]], making them suited for expeditions.


'''Shiratsuyu Kai Ni''' 

Priority: '''Medium'''
:Her second remodel increases nearly all of her combat stats making her a versatile destroyer, allowing her to perform OASW and also granting her the ability to equip [[Fleet Command Facility]] and tanks for an anti-installation role (however, she cannot use [[Daihatsu]] and its variants).
:Keep in mind that this remodel requires an Action Report.

====Recommended Roles====
* Surface combat (Second remodel)
* ASW (Second remodel)
* Anti-installation (Second remodel)

===Important Information===
* Required for A67, B61, and B121.
* Comes with a [[Type 22 Surface RADAR Kai 4]]+4 at Kai Ni.

That's right I'm the number one ship. Number one. I'm a fleet destroyer with lots of improvements!<ref>The first 6 Shiratsuyu-class ships were supposed to be the last 6 ships of the Hatsuharu-class. But were considered a new class due to extensive modifications such as; a thicker hull instead of ballast to improve stability, more extensive use of electric welding, and quadruple torpedo mounts.</ref>
Eh? "Don't be in a rush and collide with a tanker"? I'll be fine!<ref>She collided with the tanker Seiyo Maru near [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surigao_Strait Surigao Strait] while trying to avoid torpedoes from US submarines. This caused her depth charges and ammunition to explode which sunk her.</ref>

==Trivia==
*According to Seiyuu [[Tanibe Yumi]] and her [[Tanibe Yumi Interview: Kancolle Style Vol. 3|Interview]] Shiratsuyu was the first kanmusu she was given to do a voice for.
*According to Seiyuu [[Tanibe Yumi]] and her [[Tanibe Yumi Interview: Kancolle Style Vol. 3|Interview]] Shiratsuyu is also the kanmusu she commonly designates to using Anti-Air Cut-ins. (which is more reflected to her personal taste)
*Her constant references to "Number 1!" possibly refer to the fact that she was supposed to be the seventh ship of the Hatsuharu class, but due to extensive modifications instead got to be the lead ship of her own class, or she was supposed to belong to the IJN 1st Fleet 1st Destroyer Squadron (or Torpedo Squadron) and she was the first of ten ''Shiratsuyu''-class destroyers.
*Collision with tanker Seikyo Maru, 15 June 1944 in the Philippine Sea ([http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Shiratsuyu&params=09_09_N_126_51_E_ 09°09′N 126°51′E])
*During the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay she collided with her sister ship [[Samidare]]. During this battle, she was under the command of yet another sister ship, [[Shigure]] in a squadron led by [[Sendai]].
*Her name means "White dew"
