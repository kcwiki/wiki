==Introduction==
シリンダータイプの隔壁による、艦幅も重量も増やさずに水中防御を向上させる大型艦艇の防御隔壁です。
タラントでの戦訓から評価が分かれますが、一定の防御効果は期待できるといわれています。
(戦艦・巡洋戦艦・航空戦艦・正規空母(含む装甲空母)用)

The Pugliese Underwater Protection Bulkhead is a cylindrical bulkhead intended to increase underwater protection against large warships. As for the defense it provides, it should be considered as reliable when it was used in the Taranto battle training. (Can be mounted on battleships, battlecruisers, aviation battleships, and aircraft carriers (including armored carriers).)

==Notes==
