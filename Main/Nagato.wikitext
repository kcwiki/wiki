* She can carry seaplane fighters on Kai.
* She gains the ability to equip small-caliber guns, daihaitsu and tank on Kai Ni.

** It can be triggered even if you fail to activate artillery spotting.
** It can only be activated '''once per sortie'''.
** It has a chance to trigger every time Nagato takes a turn at shelling. If it fails to trigger in day, there is a chance to trigger it in the followup night battle.
** The attack will consume extra ammo from both participating battleships when triggered. The total ammo consumption will be x1.5 of the original ammo consumption of when the attack is triggered ([https://twitter.com/syoukuretin/status/1063895644790677504 Source]), hence:

**If it is triggered in day battle, it costs 10% extra ammo.
**If it is triggered in a night battle node, it costs 5% extra ammo.
**If it is triggered in a night battle in a normal node, it costs 15% extra ammo.

===Overview===
'''Kai'''
* Good firepower, HP and armour.

'''Kai Ni'''
* Great firepower and armour.
* Good HP.
* Requires blueprint.

===Fit Bonuses===
{{:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Equipment Bonuses}}
{{clear}}

'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''
* She has accuracy bonuses and penalties when equipped with certain large guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority: 

* Kai: '''High'''
: Being obtainable from normal construction and having a low remodel level makes her a valuable part of the fleet. Her high firepower, armour and HP will make her a mainstay until you obtain the LSC or event-only battleships. Although she can carry seaplane fighters, she needs to compromise her combat ability to do so.
* Kai Ni: '''Medium-High'''
: Your first Kai Ni between [[Nagato]] and [[Mutsu]] should be a priority because of their powerful skill. Ideally Nagato herself due to quest prequisites. Aside from that, she gains a significant boost to her firepower and armour. Her ability to equip daihatsu also gives her potential in the anti-installation role. Though her performace against surface targets will suffer. Her blueprint requirement and high remodel level makes her take a back seat to other battleships if you already have Mutsu at Kai Ni.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Anti-Installation - Kai Ni
* Support Expeditions

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Air Support

===Important Info===
* Required for quests A42, A74, B31, and B99. 
* An option for A43 and Bm4.

==Trivia==
*She is named after [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagato_Province Nagato Provice], modern day [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaguchi_Prefecture Yamaguchi Prefecture].
* Nagato was part of the orginal game's launch when the game was released in April 23rd, 2013.
*''Nagato'' was the only surviving Japanese Capital ship after World War II.
*The "Giant Flash" she speaks of in her sunk and wedding lines is probably a reference to the Able Nuclear Test during Operation Crossroads, where a 23-kiloton air deployed nuclear weapon was detonated over Nagato and 94 other target ships.  Nagato had been deliberately placed near the epicenter of both the Able and Baker detonations because the Pearl Harbor attack had been commanded from her bridge.
*Nagato managed to survive the Able Test unscathed, however she sprung a leak after the underwater detonation during the Baker Test, repair crews were unable to repair the leak due to high radiation levels and she capsized and sank during the night of 29/30 July 1946.
* The real-life Nagato made a cameo in the animated movie, "The Wind Rises", shown with the serpentine funnel that came with her refitting between 1923-1925.
*Sunk as a target during [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Crossroads Operation Crossroads], 25 July 1946. Currently resting in 110 ft. of water, and upside-down, she is listed as one of the top 10 diving sites in the world.
