[[file:Fit_bonus_example.png|thumb|right|Michishio Kai Ni gains one additional Firepower from equipping a 12.7cm Type C Gun Mount]]Equipment Bonuses refer to specific ship + equipment combos that trigger special effects, modifying specific stats with values referred to as "Fit Bonuses". These are displayed in the game by a '''â†‘+''' symbol in front of each applicable stat.

These bonuses should not be confused with the hidden Accuracy or Firepower Fit Bonuses, generally exclusive to gun mounts. To differentiate with hidden Fit Bonuses, they are also referred to as "Visible Fit Bonuses".

==Fit Bonus Specifics==
Although displayed in the game, some Fit Bonuses have an erroneous effect or outright don't work.

As of 9 February 2021, the following Fit Bonuses present issues:

==Completely functional==
These Fit Bonuses work in every scenario:
* {{Range}} '''Range'''.
* {{Evasion}} '''Evasion'''.
* {{Armor}} '''Armor'''.

===Formulas===
* {{Firepower}} '''Day Surface Shelling''' - All {{Firepower}} Firepower fits work as intended.
* {{Firepower}}{{Torpedo}} '''Night Surface Shelling''' - All fits work as intended.
** Especially for Ark Royal and [[Swordfish]]-series, the torpedo stat does not work.
* {{Firepower}}{{Torpedo}}{{Dive}} '''Carrier Shelling''' - All fit sources work as intended. The {{Torpedo}} Torpedo fit will now be included for shelling power calculation '''(NEW)''' ''04/08/2021''
* {{Torpedo}}{{Dive}} '''Airstrike''' - All fits work but not as intended. The {{Torpedo}} Torpedo fit will be added to airstrike power to either {{Dive}} Dive Bombing stat or {{Torpedo}} Torpedo depending on the type of the plane. '''(NEW)''' ''04/08/2021''
* {{Torpedo}} '''Torpedo Attacks''' - All {{Torpedo}} Torpedo fits work as intended.
** This includes fits provided by sources that are not torpedoes, such as seaplanes and lookouts.

==Partially functional==
These Fit Bonuses have at least one situation in which they don't work as intended:

* {{LOS}} '''LoS''': Bonuses count as ship base LoS and not equipment, for routing purposes. No effect for artillery spotting.<ref>https://twitter.com/Matsu_class_DD/status/1245457218956226560</ref>.
** SG Radar (Initial Model) does not contribute for any calculation<ref>https://twitter.com/CC_jabberwock/status/1089154587628466177</ref>

===Formulas===
* {{ASW}} '''Surface Anti-Submarine Shelling''': Does not increase {{ASW}} ASW shelling damage<ref>https://twitter.com/ayanamist_m2/status/1035100000391290880</ref>, but still contributes to reaching the OASW threshold of 100<ref>https://twitter.com/ayanamist_m2/status/1087670868401053696</ref>.

==Completely broken==
These fits have no effect:
* {{AA}} '''Anti-Air''': Does not work under any circumstances<ref>https://twitter.com/ayanamist_m2/status/1087678973331484673</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/mizucchi41/status/1246676483025686529</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/mizucchi41/status/1028610701571411968</ref>. Bonus granted to aircraft does not contribute to Air Power<ref>https://twitter.com/DarkQuetzal/status/1241651932361412610</ref>
* {{Acc}} '''Accuracy''': Does not work under any circumstances, as Accuracy is a derived stat.<ref>https://twitter.com/chang1124414276/status/1242332458936197120</ref>

===Formulas===
* {{Firepower}}{{Torpedo}}{{Dive}}{{ASW}} '''Night Carrier Cut-in Attack''': None of the fit stats works under any circumstances<ref>https://twitter.com/shiro_sh39/status/1255895548898361346</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/SZRandomness/status/1144649656091021312</ref>.
** Additionally, the firepower granted by Night Operations equipment such as Night Operations Personnel + Skilled Deckhands provide no damage increase for this formula<ref>https://twitter.com/SZRandomness/status/1144649656091021312</ref>.
* {{ASW}} '''Plane-based Anti-Submarine Shelling''': Does not increase {{ASW}} ASW shelling damage, and does not contribute to reach the OASW threshold<ref>https://twitter.com/99_999999999/status/1273936394927276033</ref>).

=Explanation=

Fit Bonuses are not considered a part of an equipment's stat, and are instead added to the ship's actual stat directly. This is what leads to inconsistencies in the formulas.

The displayed value in a given stat is given by:

<math>\text{Final Value} = \text{Base Stat} + \text{Equipment Stat} + \text{Fit Bonus}</math>

'''Where:'''
* Final Value is the the displayed Value in the ship card.
* Base Stat is the stat without '''any equipment'''.
* Equipment Stat is the equipments '''displayed stat'''.
* Fit Bonus is the added value to the stat by '''fits'''.

Some formulas, such as {{Firepower}} Surface Shelling, {{Torpedo}}Opening/Closing Torpedo Salvos and {{Firepower}} Carrier Shelling use the Final Value. In those cases, the fit bonuses work as intended.

However, other formulas break down the stats for various reasons (mainly for applying different weighting to equipment, as in {{ASW}}ASW and {{AA}}Anti-Air formulas, or using other parameters like the {{Acc}}Accuracy formula), and instead use '''Base Stat''' and the sum of '''Equipment Stats''' instead. In those cases, '''Fit Bonus''' is not used anywhere in the formula, and therefore does not work.
