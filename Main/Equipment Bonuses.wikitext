Equipment Bonuses refer to specific ship + equipment combos that trigger special effects, modifying specific stats with values referred to as "Fit Bonuses". These are displayed in the game by a '''â†‘+''' symbol in front of each applicable stat.

These bonuses should not be confused with the hidden Accuracy Fit Bonuses, generally exclusive to gun mounts.

==Fit Bonus Specifics==

===Explanation===

Fit Bonuses are not considered a part of an equipment's stat, and are instead added to the ship's actual stat directly. This is what leads to inconsistencies in the formulas.

The displayed value in a given stat is given by:

<math>\text{Final Value} = \text{Base Stat} + \text{Equipment Stat} + \text{Fit Bonus}</math>

'''Where:'''
* Final Value is the the displayed Value in the ship card.
* Base Stat is the stat without '''any equipment'''.
* Equipment Stat is the equipments '''displayed stat'''.
* Fit Bonus is the added value to the stat by '''fits'''.

Some formulas, such as {{Firepower}} Surface Shelling, {{Torpedo}}Opening/Closing Torpedo Salvos and {{Firepower}} Carrier Shelling use the Final Value. In those cases, the fit bonuses work as intended.

However, other formulas break down the stats for various reasons (mainly for applying different weighting to equipment, as in {{ASW}}ASW and {{AA}}Anti-Air formulas, or using other parameters like the {{Acc}}Accuracy formula), and instead use '''Base Stat''' and the sum of '''Equipment Stats''' instead. In those cases, '''Fit Bonus''' is not used anywhere in the formula, and therefore does not work.
