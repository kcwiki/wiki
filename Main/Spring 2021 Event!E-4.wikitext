The event guides are to be constructed through the respective [[Sandbox/Spring 2021 E-4|Event map page guide]] and reviewed by editor staff / collaboration committee before being approved here. '''Do not under any circumstance update the guides through this page or attempt to fix them through this page.''' Please only update guides through their respective sandbox pages.

==General Guidelines==
E4 is 4 Phase Map with a total of 4 ship locking tags, although 2 tags are shared with other maps:
*{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag7}}Teal (Striking Force)
*{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag8}}Red (Transportation Force, TCF)
*{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag3}}Blue (3rd Fleet, CTF, shared with '''E2-2''')
*{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag9}}Green (2nd Fleet, STF, shared with '''E5-2''').

* This map also makes use of the Striking Force mechanic, which allows you to sortie a 7 ship fleet, which is formed in the 3rd Fleet slot.
* This Map has 3 LBAS Bases available for offensive operations

==Phase 1: Defeat Lycoris Hime==
This phase will pit you against Lycoris Hime, accompanied by Supply Depot Himes. The key to successfully clearing this phase is anti-installation equipment. The route to the boss contains 2 submarine and 2 air raid nodes. Make sure you have adequate AACI, ASW, and anti-installation equipment to tackle this phase. 
* Composition:{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag7}}{{ToolTip|[Teal Tag]|'''Striking Force'''}} Strike Force Fleet with 7 ships: 2CA(V), 1-2 CL, 3-4 DD '''OR''' 0-1 AV, 2-3 CA(V), 1 CL, 2-3 DD
**'''FAST Fleet'''. Slow will off-route to {{MapRoute|A|red}}.
**A fleet with AV will route to {{MapRoute|J|blue}} which is a repair node. 
**You can also route to {{MapRoute|J|blue}} if you have 3 CA(V)
* Route: {{MapRoute|B|red|D|red|E|red|G|red|I|red|L|red}} with 0 AV or less than 2 CA(V)
** {{MapRoute|B|red|D|red|E|red|G|red|I|red|J|blue|L|red}} with 1 AV or 3 CA(V)
* LBAS: Range 8 AP/AS: 264/594 ('''HARD''')
* Note: It is recommended that you use a LBAS with Toukai in order to help increase your passing rate through the nodes {{MapRoute|B|red}} and {{MapRoute|E|red}}
*LoS Requirement: About '''Cn3 59+/42+/38+/32+''' is required on '''Hard/Medium/Easy/Casual''' to route from {{MapRoute|I|red}} to {{MapRoute|L|red}}.
** If you are using the AV or 3CAV Route the LOS requirement is about: '''Cn3 60+/45+/40+/40+''' on '''Hard/Medium/Easy/Casual''' to route from {{MapRoute|I|red}} to {{MapRoute|J|blue}}

==Phase 2: TP Phase==
* Composition:{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag8}}{{ToolTip|[Red Tag]|'''Transportation Force'''}} Transport Combined Fleet (TCF): 1 CVE, 1 AV/CL 4 DD + 1-2 CL, 4-5 DD '''FAST Fleet'''
* Route: {{MapRoute |Q|red|Q2|red|S|red|T|blue|U|red|V1|green|V|red}}
* LBAS Range: 4, no airpower at the boss. There are 3 air raids on route
* Note: AACI is highly recommended, as is equipping the CVE and AV with Fighters and Seaplane Fighters to achieve higher airstates
** Bringing a CA in your fleet will off-route you to another combat node along the way.
** Bring at least 1-2 DDs capable of equipping full anti-installation set-ups as they will be needed for unlocking purposes later on.

==Phase 2.5: Unlock Node Y==
There are 4 different requirements to complete to unlock {{MapRoute|Y|Red}}:

|-|Node O=
* Composition:{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag9}}{{ToolTip|[Green Tag]|'''2nd Fleet'''}} STF: 3(F)BB, 1 BBV/CVL 1-2 CA(V), 0-1 CL + 1-2 CA(V), 1-2 CLT, 1 CL, 2-3 DD
* Route: {{MapRoute|M|red|O|red}}
* LBAS: Range = 4
* Note: This is also the P4 and E5 fleet. Mule your CV and CAV to achieve AS otherwise, bring an LBAS with fighters to help with the node also.
** A full fleet is not strictly necessary for this part; a skeleton fleet with sufficient FP to achieve AS will also suffice.
|-|Node W=
* Composition:{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag8}}{{ToolTip|[Red Tag]|'''Transportation Force'''}} TCF: 0-1 CVE, 0-1 CL, 0-1 CAV/AV, 4 DD + 1-2 CL 4-5 DD
* Route: {{MapRoute |Q|red|Q2|red|S|red|T|blue|V3|red|W|red}}
* LBAS: Range = 5
* Note: The node composes of Supply Depot Hime in the main fleet and PT Imp pack following in the escort fleet. It is highly recommended to bring along Nuke setup (Kami Tank, WG42, and Type 89 Daihatsu with Medium tank) in the main and escort fleet and HA gun/AA guns/skilled lookouts to kill PT imps in the escort.
* LOS: There is relatively steep LOS requirement needed to get to the node. You need around Cn1 = 22+ in order to route to {{MapRoute|W|red}}
|-|Node X=
* Composition:{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag7}}{{ToolTip|[Teal Tag]|'''Striking Force'''}} Strike Force: 1 CL, 4-6 DD
* Route: {{MapRoute |B|red|D|red|E|red|X2|red|X|red}}
* LBAS: Range = 5
* TCI may be considered for taking out the Light Cruiser Princess, preferably with someone you already locked on this fleet.
* LOS: There is a LOS requirement needed to get to the node. You need around Cn3 = 64+ in order to route to {{MapRoute|X|red}}
</tabber>

==Phase 3: Defeat Jellyfish Hime==
* Composition:{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag3}}{{ToolTip|[Blue Tag]|'''3rd Fleet'''}} CTF: 2-3 CV(B), 0-1 CV(L), 2-3 CA(V), 0-1 CL + 1 CA, 1 CLT, 1 CL, 3 DD. A maximum of 3 CV(B/L) can be used in the fleet.
* Route: {{MapRoute |B|red|C|blue|F|red|Y1|red|Y2|red|Y|red}}
* LBAS: Range = 7 AP/AS 280/630 ('''HARD''')
* Note: Make sure you have plenty of air power and AACI to help with both passing rate and the boss
**Tag is shared with E2 Phase 2 (blue).

==Phase 3.5==
This phase is '''ONLY REQUIRED ON HARD''' to unlock the last boss of this map. All other difficulties can skip this phase altogether. For this phase, you are required to S rank {{MapRoute |L|red}}
* Composition: Use the same fleet you used in Phase 1 with the strike force fleet. 
* Route: {{MapRoute |B|red|D|red|E|red|G|red|I|red|L|red}}
* LBAS: Range = 8

==Phase 4: Defeat New Southern Battleship Hime==
* Composition:{{Shiplock|Spring2021EventTag9}}{{ToolTip|[Green Tag]|'''2nd Fleet'''}} STF: 2-3 (F)BB, 0-1 BBV or CVL (2 CVL), 1-2 CA(V), 0-1 CL + 1-2 CA(V), 1-2 CLT, 1 CL, 2-3 DD
* Route: {{MapRoute |M|red|O|red|Z1|red|Z2|red|Z|red}}
* LBAS: Range = 8 AP/AS: 176/396 for '''Hard'''
* Note: This phase lock will be reused in E5 for Phase 2. You have the option to bring Nelson or Nagato and make use of the touch mechanics here.

==Debuff Phase==
You can do all these steps in any order. There are 6 requirements that must be met once Last Dance threshold has been reached:
* AS LBAS Defense Once
* S rank node {{MapRoute |I|red}}
* AS at node {{MapRoute |G|red}}
* S rank at node {{MapRoute |L|red}}
* A rank at node {{MapRoute |Y|red}}
* S rank at node {{MapRoute |Z2|red}}
