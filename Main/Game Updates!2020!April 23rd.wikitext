#*Kongou-class battleship Hiei has received her long-awaited third remodel, Hiei Kai Ni C.
#**One of her guns will be replaced with torpedo tubes for close range torpedo attacks, making her a deadly night combatant.

#**Similarly to her older sister, she will receive the new remodel animation.
#**New voice lines have also been implemented.
#**The remodel asks for two Blueprints, two New Artillery Materials and 1 Action Report.
#**Under specific circumstances she will be able to use a powerful night battle attack.
#***Named "Consorts' Night Battle".
#***Requires Hiei to be the flagship.
#***Requires the second Shipgirl to be Kongou Kai Ni C or Kirishima Kai Ni (this will change to her third remodel when available).
#***This chance is further boosted by equipping a large searchlight and gets even higher with a radar.
#***Kongou Kai Ni C has received the same ability.
#****She can used it when paired with Hiei Kai Ni C and Haruna Kai Ni (this will change to her third remodel when available).
#****It can also be used when paired with British battleships, however its power level is unknown.
#****Additionally this version has a higher chance of occurring when equipped with a radar and further bonus when a large searchlight is also present (opposite of Hiei)
#***Requires Line Ahead or Formation 4 to be usable.
#***Chance of this effect occurring is dependent on proficiency level of each Shipgirl.
