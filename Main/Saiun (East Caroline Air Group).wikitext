==Introduction==
※「我ニ追イツク敵機無シ」有名な無電を発した俊足の艦上偵察機「彩雲」。<br>
敵戦闘機の追随を許さない高速性能を誇る、高性能な艦上偵察機です。悪化した戦況の中、敵情偵察に海上へと飛び立ちました。「光」作戦によりトラック基地に輸送された「彩雲」。同基地の東カロリン航空隊所属「彩雲」は、ウルシー環礁泊地の偵察に活躍します。

The swift carrier-based reconnaissance plane "Saiun" that sent the famous telegraph "No enemy plane can catch us!".<br>
This sophisticated carrier-based reconnaissance plane boasts a high speed that does not allow enemy fighter planes to pursue them. As the war took a turn for the worse it took off into the vast sea in order to scout the enemy's movements. This "Saiun" has been transported to the Truk base as part of Operation "Hikari". The "Saiun" planes of the East Caroline Air Group at said base play a large role in scouting the Ulithi Atoll anchorage.
