'''Bokukawauso'''

One of the more interesting mascot to appear at the Zuiun & Reppu Festival is the "BokuKawauso" (Which literally translates to "I'm an Otter!") Which is an otter like creature that appeared starting on '''May 12th, 2019'''. The origin of this masoct came from a drawing contest held by the Seiyuus at the KanColle Arcade JAEPO expo gathering back in February in Japan. [[Uchida Shu]] along with two other seiyuus were asked to draw "What wanted to see appear in KanColle Arcades (Animals are ok too!)" As a result, Uchida Shu came up with a crude doodle of the otter creature which would late be establish as a mascot entertainer at the Zuiun & Reppu Festival. Many people have had various unique reactions to the dev's consideration of using Uchida Shu's doodle to make into a mascot character in the KanColle Verse.
