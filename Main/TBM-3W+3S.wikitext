==Introduction==
重い発動機と頑丈なボディを備えた、太平洋の戦い、その後半の大空を駆けた主力雷撃機「TBF」。<br>
同機に哨戒用レーダーを搭載したW型、さらに同機とペアを組む対潜攻撃に特化したS型。<br>
戦後海上自衛隊でも運用された、対潜哨戒攻撃機ペアをさらに汎用性を高めたif改装機による攻撃哨戒機隊です。

Possessing a heavy engine and a sturdy airframe, the TBF was the main torpedo bomber that soared in the skies during the latter half of the Pacific War.<br>
This is a combination of the W-type that was mounted with a radar for patrolling and the S-type that was designed for anti-submarine strikes.<br>
This is a what-if version that would've been operated by the post-war JMSDF as a hunter-killer combo after upgrades to increase versatility.
