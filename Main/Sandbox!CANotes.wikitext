'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''
* She gains bonus evasion and accuracy at night when equipped with 20.3cm variants. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority:'''Low'''

* Kai
: She has abysmal firepower and torpedo which makes her bad in night battles. While she is easy to obtain, there are other heavy cruisers of similar rarity that are better than she is. 

* Kai Ni
: She gets a boost to her firepower and torpedo that brings her in line with the average heavy cruiser. This makes her effective in night battle although still not the best. Her fit bonus means she can perform as well as better heavy cruisers provided you give her two [[20.3cm(no.2) Twin Gun Mount]]. She falls behind the better heavy cruisers in HP and armour.

Priority: '''Medium'''

: She is an average heavy cruiser with decent firepower and torpedo. She is easy to obtain and has a low remodel level which makes her a decent heavy cruiser to start off with. Her downside is that she lacks any further upgrades. She makes a great stand in for when you don't have any heavy cruiser kai nis to depend on because of her low remodel level.

* She gains bonus evasion and accuracy at night when equipped with 20.3cm variants. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority:'''High'''

: Her firepower and torpedo stats are decent which makes her usable for combat. However, her defensive stats make her a lot more vulnerable than the other heavy cruisers of similar power. Her advantage is her very low remodel level and her ability to carry seaplane fighters. The latter is important when you need to bring air support to maps where carriers are restricted. This is especially important because the number of aviation cruisers in game is small. She is also fast, which means she isn't affected by speed restrictions either. As an added bonus, her large slot allows her to equip seaplane bombers with less risk that they will all be shot down.

: Her firepower and torpedo stats are decent which makes her usable for combat. However, her defensive stats make her a lot more vulnerable than the other heavy cruisers of similar power. Her advantage over those heavy cruisers is the ability to carry seaplane fighters. The latter is important when you need to bring air support to maps where carriers are restricted. This is especially important because the number of aviation cruisers in game is small. She is also fast, which means she isn't affected by speed restrictions either. In addition, she is relatively easier to obtain making her an important aviation cruiser.

* Kai Ni: '''Medium'''
: She gains a significant increase to her torpedo and HP which translates into higher damage potential and survivability. Her ability to equip 8cm guns in he reinforcement expansion also increases her flexibility by allowing her to continue to do night battle special attacks while maximising air power. Although her remodel level and cost is high, she is well worth the cost.

* Kai Ni Kou: '''Low'''
: Her Kai Ni Kou remodel turns her into a light carrier with great firepower, HP and armour. Her plane count is low and her slots are small but she makes an excellent shelling carrier. She shouldn't be used against heavy anti-air because her slots are at risk of being emptied. Her targeting priority is also different compared to other light carriers. She will prioritise surface ships over submarines when both are present.

* Kai
: At Kai she is an average heavy cruiser with decent firepower and torpedo. She has a low remodel level but she is rarer than other heavy cruisers that perform the same.

* Kai Ni
: She gains small increases to her stats across the board but she doesn't match up to the better Kai Ni heavy cruisers. She does become an aviation cruiser but her high remodel level and blueprint cost makes it an expensive remodel compared to the Mogami-class. She is still important because of the rarity of aviation cruisers in the game.

===Analysis===
* Kai: '''Medium'''
: She has decent firepower that is let down by her abysmal torpedo stat. This makes her terrible in night battle which is an important role for heavy cruisers. She is in a unique position of being able to carry seaplane fighters while being classified as a heavy cruiser. This allows her to provide air support in maps or quests where aviation cruisers are restricted. Do note that her long range can interfere with your shelling order, putting her at the same priority as battleships.

* Kai Ni: '''Low'''
: She gains a significant increase to her firepower which makes her a much better daytime combatant. She is still let down by her torpedo stat that limits her damage potential at night. Her remodel also requires a blueprint which is a steep cost for minimal upgrade.
