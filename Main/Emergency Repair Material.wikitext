=Overview=

Emergency Repair Materials were added during the [[Summer 2019 Event]] along with the [[Repairs#Emergency_Anchorage_Repairs|Emergency Anchorage Repair]] mechanic that they are required for. They can currently only be obtained from events or from the [[Shop|cash shop]]. This item is '''consumed''' whenever emergency repairs are performed.

Currently the emergency repair mechanic is '''not worth using''' due to the limited nature of the repairs and the requirements involved.

=How to obtain=
