==Introduction==
「十四試局地戦闘機」として開発された、対爆撃機要撃に特化した迎撃戦闘機「雷電」です。<br/>
零戦などの艦上戦闘機「甲戦」に対して、局地戦闘機「乙戦」として開発・運用されました。<br/>
格闘戦向きではありませんが、優れた上昇力と大火力を備えています。

Developed under the specification for the “Year 14 (Showa 14 or 1939) Land-based Fighter” the “Raiden” was an inceptor that specialized in combating bombers.  While the carrier based Zero Fighter represented Plan A for offensive operations, as a local inceptor the Raiden was developed operated under Plan B for defense.  With poor maneuverability it was not suited for dogfights; however it had excellent climbing performance and armament.

==Notes==
'''Unbuildable'''. Clear Reward for [[Spring 2016 Event#E-5|Spring 2016 Event E-5]] (Medium/Hard Only).
