==Introduction==
紅茶の国で建造されたビックセブン、条約下時代に建造された16inch砲搭載超弩級戦艦ネルソン級。その主兵装として、同艦前半部に集中配備された大口径三連装戦艦主砲の改良型です。さらに同砲と連携する射撃管制レーダー284型を採用、精度の高いレーダー射撃も可能です。ネルソン級や紅茶の国の戦艦で運用することで、高い戦闘力を期待できます。

''The Nelson-class was a class of super-dreadnoughts that were built with 16 inch guns in the land of black tea as part of the Big Seven under the naval treaty. These large-caliber triple battleship guns are an improved version of the ones that were used as their main armament and carried entirely in the front. Furthermore, the Type 284 Fire-Control Radar that is used in tandem with the guns allows highly accurate radar guided shelling. You can expect an excellent performance in combat when using them on ships like the Nelson-class or other battleships from the land of black tea.''
