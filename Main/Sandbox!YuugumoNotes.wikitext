===Analysis===
Priority: '''Very Low'''
: She is just an average destroyer at Kai that doesn't have anything to set her apart from the rest
: Her Kai Ni gives her the ability to equip medium bulges and fleet command facilities in addition to significantly increasing her firepower and torpedo stats. In spite of this she is still weaker in combat than almost all top tier DDs and also costs a blueprint and action report to become just slightly above average. 
: Overall she's one of the most expensive destroyers for not much potential and should be held off on until you have all top tier and specialist DDs leveled.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat

===Important Information===
* Required for A55, A91, B47, B126, and C23.
* An option for A88, B117, C15, and C21. 
* Comes with a [[12.7cm Twin Mount Type-D Kai 2]] and a [[Type 13 Air RADAR Kai]] +4 on Kai Ni

In spite of this she is still weaker in combat than almost all top tier DDs and also costs a blueprint and action report to become just slightly above average. She can however equip daihatsu landing crafts so she can function in expeditions and to some degree against certain installations weak to these but a combination of relatively low firepower compared to top DDs make her a sub par choice for anti-installation duty.
: Overall her cost of a blueprint + action report makes her very low priority when better options like Asashio class K2s exist.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''
: She is just an average destroyer at Kai that doesn't have anything to set her apart from the rest
: Her Kai Ni gives her the ability to equip medium bulges and type 2 tanks in addition to significantly increasing her firepower and torpedo stats. Her decent firepower combined with the Yuugumo class gun-fits make her one of the stronger choices for anti-installation setups utilizing night battle double attacks. However the fact that she costs a blueprint and an action report and is still weaker at her intended roles than ships like Kuroshio and Arashio makes her very low priority.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Medium/Low'''
: She is just an average destroyer at Kai that doesn't have anything to set her apart from the rest
: Her Kai Ni gives her the ability to equip medium bulges and fleet command facilities in addition to significantly increasing her firepower and torpedo stats. She becomes one of the most powerful combat destroyers with very high firepower and good fit bonuses to enhance this potential. In addition she also has 30 base luck which means with a relatively low investment you can run her with torpedo cut-in setups for events.
: She is also required for a quarterly quest that can reward an Action Report which can be useful if you need them to complete remodels and conversions requiring those. Overall she's a very powerful combat destroyer with above average luck, the only thing holding her back is her remodel cost which requires an action report and a blueprint.
