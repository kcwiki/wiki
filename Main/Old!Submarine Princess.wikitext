==Trivia==
*'''Voiced by''': ???
*'''Illustrated by''': Akira
[[File:Submarine_Hime_Debuff.png|thumb|right|Upon completed thec debuff requirements and fighting the sub hime using a Carrier Task Force, the tint to her color will change color slightly.]]The Submarine Princess is the second known boss to introduce the "Armor Crush system. Unlike the previous system which the Air-Defense Hime is used, the debuff system used for Sumarine Princess is activated only after complete certain requirements a certain number of times. 
*By taking out the installation bosses at Node J and Node M one times each and then engaging the Submarine Princess with a Carrier Task Force, the color of the glow on her machinery will change from a blue tint to a more greenish tint. Her pose and expression will also show a slight change.
*Along with this, her dialogue will change in the process.
