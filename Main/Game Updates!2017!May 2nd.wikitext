'''May 2nd, 2017''' ''The Spring 2017 Event Update''

#[[Quests#February_28th.2C_2017|Spring related quests]] will come to an end.
#The following maps for the [[Spring 2017 Event]] have been released:
#*E-1: Sortie! ÅŒminato Guard District
#*E-2: Fleet, Assemble! To the Hitokappu Anchorage
#*E-3: Fleet, Head out! Reinforce the Northern Defence Line!
#From E-2 onwards, it is possible to acquire the Destroyer Escort / Coastal Defence Ship (DE) [[Kunashiri]] as a drop. Also, from E-3 onwards (which requires use of a Combined Fleet), it is possible to acquire the DE [[Shimushu]] and the Supply Vessel (AO) [[Kamoi]]. The latter can be remodeled into a Seaplane Tender (AV), and does ''not'' require use of a Blueprint in order to do so.
#Upon clearing E-3, Admirals will be rewarded with the Converted Merchant Aircraft Carrier [[Kasuga Maru]]. She starts off as a very weak aircraft carrier, but can eventually be remodeled into a more powerful carrier with her own distinctive strengths.
#*Her final remodel requires a '''Prototype Catapult''', which can be obtained from the latter half of this event.
