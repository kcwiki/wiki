==Gameplay Notes==
===Special Mechanics===
* Able to perform special AACI. Please see [[Anti-Air Cut-In]] for more details.
* She has a special attack called the '''Nelson Touch''' that targets 3 enemies at random.
** The activation requirements are:
*** Nelson as the flagship of the 1st fleet.
*** Nelson must not be more than <span style="color:gold;">'''lightly damaged (小破)'''</span>.
*** There must be 6 ships in the fleet.
*** There must be no submarines in the fleet.
*** The 3rd and 5th ships must not be a carrier.
*** '''Double line formation''' needs to be selected in a single fleet OR '''Cruising Formation 2''' for a combined fleet.
** If triggered, Nelson, the 3rd ship, and the 5th ship will perform one attack each with a 2x post-cap modifier.
*** If the engagement is <span style="color:red;">Red T</span>, then the post-cap modifier becomes 2.5x.
** It can be triggered even if you fail to activate artillery spotting.
** It can only be activated '''once per sortie'''.
** It has a chance to trigger every time Nelson takes a turn at shelling. If it fails to trigger in day, there is a chance to trigger it in the followup night battle.
** It does not cost any extra resources if triggered.
** Trigger rate is believed to be related to:
*** The total level of all girls involved in the attack
*** Nelson's luck {{Luck}} stat.<ref>https://twitter.com/dewydrops/status/1181520911444271105?s=19</ref>

===Overview===
* Good firepower and armour.
* Decent HP.

===Fit Bonuses===

'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''
* She has accuracy bonuses and penalties when equipped with certain large guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''High'''

: She has great firepower for a battleship but what really makes her stand out is her powerful special ability. Unlike [[Nagato]] and [[Mutsu]], her ability does not take extra ammo when it triggers; but it has a slightly weaker multiplier and requires 3 good ships instead of just 2 to make full use of it. Although she is event-only and hard to get, she'll serve you very well when you do get her. Her AACI has a low fixed shootdown and multiplier which makes it inadvisable to run.
