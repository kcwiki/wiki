The Fall 2015 event "Charge! Maritime Transport Operation" will start November 18th, 2015. The event will be medium-scaled and will feature combined fleets. The Kancolle dev team has hinted the event will be taking place in a "circular island" in the Southern Seas. Within that location, there will be several battles and "transportation operations". The event map will therefore likely be a series of battles that took place at [[wikipedia:Kolombangara|Kolombangara]]. 

If this is true, expect the majority of the events battles to consist of smaller fleets performing "Tokyo Express" runs. The dev team have hinted that well-trained destoyers and light cruisers will be key to clearing the event. Since most of the battles at Kolombongara were small engagements, sorties will likely be inspired by  the [[Wikipedia:Battle of Kula Gulf|Battle of Kula Gulf]], [[Wikipedia:Battle of Kolombangara|The Battle of Kolombangara]], and the [[Wikipedia:Battle of Vella Gulf|Battle of Vella Gulf]]. Some maps may feature only night battles. In addition, there will be some engagement involving larger fleets such as battleships and aircraft carriers. These will be combined fleet operations.

The event is planned to end on December 8th,2015.
