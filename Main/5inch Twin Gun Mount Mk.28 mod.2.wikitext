''This is the improved version of a great-performing small-caliber dual-purpose gun developed and utilized by the USA.''<br/>
''This is a twin-gun dual-purpose gun, and it was utilized by capital ships as anti-air armament. This is a new-type of dual-purpose gun with good balance of performance.''

==Notes==
'''Unbuildable'''. Stock equipment of [[Iowa]] and Iowa Kai.<br/>
With regards to [[Aerial Combat#Anti-Air Cut-In|Anti-Air Cut-In]], it behaves like [[12.7cm Twin High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]] and [[90mm Single High Angled Gun]]; you only need an AA RADAR equipped with it to enable AACI.
