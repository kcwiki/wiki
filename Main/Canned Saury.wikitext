==Introduction==

旬の秋刀魚「蒲焼」缶詰です。単品はもちろん、おにぎり等と一緒に食すとより美味しい！

The seasonal "Kabayaki" Pacific Saury sealed in a can. Individually of course, and it tastes more delicious when eaten with Onigiri and so forth.

==Notes==

During the [[Seasonal/Saury 2015|Saury Fishing Seasonal Event]], you could collect a limited time Saury item. This was used in multiple ways, but Based on the dev notes, the saury from the  one option, requiring seven Saury, was to cook the Kabayaki recipe and obtain Canned Saury.

Canned Saury can be equipped and has effects identical to those of [[Battle Rations]]: when consumed, the one who 'eats' it gets a sizable [[morale]] boost while kanmusus 'beside' her (above and below her in the battle composition) get a small morale boost.
