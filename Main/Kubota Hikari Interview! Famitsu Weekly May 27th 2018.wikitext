==One Surprise After Another in Encountering Intrepid!?==

'''Interviewer (I):''' Kubota-san, you joined KanColle this past February. Please tell us how it felt to portray [[Intrepid]].

'''Kubota (K):''' I was happy and really surprised to be able to play a character for a work as popular as KanColle.
 
'''I:''' Did you get the role via audition?

'''K:''' No - from what I understand, KanColle Management Naval District-san explicitly selected for a seiyuu with good English, since Intrepid has a lot of English lines. When I first got the script, I did think it was for an audition though (laugh). Either way, there was a lot of lines - it felt like nothing I had done before. I remember when I got to the studio and they went, "We're counting on your for [[Intrepid]]'s recording today!" being shocked and going "Ah, I'm performing her!"
 
'''I:''' There was a misunderstanding like that (laugh)? So you were chosen for being multilingual - Kubota-san, is English your strong suit?

'''K:''' Well... everyone at the KanColle Management Naval District told me "Kubota-san, your English is wonderful! It's got such a great atmosphere to it!", but I myself wouldn't say I'm so conversant in it. My promotional materials at the office list "Hobbies and Skills: English Conversation"; maybe that's why I was recommended. I myself can't say for sure if my English is good enough to consider it my specialty. When I was recording I pushed myself to make use of what I had learned under a native speaker at an English language school. I just hope my pronunciation sounded somewhat natural.
 
'''I:''' Speaking both English and Japanese, let alone transitioning between them in the middle of the conversation, seems pretty difficult. How did you do it?

'''K:''' Right, well, when you plan to switch to English in a conversation, you kind of want to start speaking Japanese in a funny stop-and-go sort of way... The line I really had to work on was the part in her introduction where she goes, "I'm the fifth of the Essex-class carriers, Intrepid!" Keeping well in mind the switches between Japanese and English, I took a lot of retakes trying to string together phrases like "Essex-class koukuu boukan" while sounding smooth.

 
'''I:''' It sounds like doing Intrepid was particularly difficult. Kubota-san, how did you try and capture her personality?

'''K:''' As an American shipgirl, Intrepid is the type of character whose lines are full of exclamation marks. She's a really vivacious and spirited girl, isn't she? From the point of view of the Japanese shipgirls she might seem really enthusiastic, but she herself thinks it's a pretty normal level. That said, overdoing it would make her too out of place, so I had to be sure to moderate it.
 
'''I:''' What kind of acting instructions did you get from the staff?

'''K:''' I actually was too energetic at first, so they lightly asked me to tone it down a bit, to sound gentler and more discreet so that I could play the character smoothly. I was really grateful for the advice. They told me to remember to try to express a sort of really tolerant protectiveness over everyone. Intrepid has a lot of kind lines where she's making sure everyone feels invited and taken care of.
 
'''I:''' She certainly does have a sort of tolerance to her.

'''K:''' Right. Like a mother or an older sister, perhaps... I also really emphasized her damaged lines. Americans have an image of being really animated with their gestures and body language - I raised the energy, hoping that could be audible in her lines alone. Her heavy damage line especially - I imagined I was smashed to bits. Looking back, I'm glad I put so much effort into it.
 
'''I:''' So what's attractive about [[Intrepid]] is her two sides - her gentleness and her energy.

'''K:''' I think a naval base with [[Intrepid]] will be much livelier. I'd love to continue supporting KanColle from here on out - please continue to support us!
