**CL ≥ 1 and DD ≥ 4
**CL ≥ 1 and CA = 5
*Random between M and N if fleet contains only SS(V)
*Random between L, M and N if fleet contains any SS(V)
*Otherwise, random between L and N, but the heavier the fleet (as in more BB or CV(L)), the more likely you will go to L

=== Tips ===
*Due to the danger of Late Model Destroyers present in Easter Orel Sea, Orel cruising has been rendered difficult to achieve and thus, can be rendered obsolete by changes to 2-3 after the HTML5 update.
*Regarding the branching rules, '''1 XX 1 CL 4 DD''' or '''1 CL 5 CA''' are the only two comps that guarantees the boss routing. Otherwise, any other fleets has a chance of off-routing, but should still be able to reach the boss node most of the times as long as CL+DD ≥ 4
**Bring at least one AV, CV(B/L) or CL to avoid chance of off-routing from F to H.
**Bring at least 1 AV, 2 DD/DE to avoid chance of off-routing from F to H when rolling the north branch, and avoid off-routing entirely when rolling the south branch.
**Bringing more heavy ships ((F)BB(V)/CV(L/B)) will reduce the chances of reaching the boss.
**Fleets that contains SS/SSV have a chance of reaching dead end nodes which includes nodes H, L and M

<br/>'''Recommended Fleet'''
*'''2(F)BB(V)+CV(L/B) 1AV 1CL 2DD'''
**The standard comp used for farming the boss node or clearing daily. Note that if you start at node B in the beginning, you have around 10% offroute near the end ('''J-L''' route). If you start at node A however, will guarantee the boss fight due to no deadend in the south route.
*'''1CL 4DD 1XX or 1CL 5CA (Not CAV)'''
**100% boss routing, but may cause some issue reaching the boss.
