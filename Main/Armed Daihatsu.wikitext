==Introduction==
大発動艇、略して「大発」。輸送船からの揚陸作業や上陸戦に用いた、現代でいうところの「上陸用舟艇」です。揚陸艦などで運用可能な海上のトラックのような「大発」、これに陸戦用の野砲や機銃などを装備した、文字通り「武装大発」です。上陸部隊の支援に本領発揮、さらに極めて限定的ですが対PT戦も可能です。様々な現地改修バージョンも存在します。

Daihatsu-class landing craft, or "Daihatsu" for short. In modern times, it's called a "landing craft" and used for landing troops and materiel. Daihatsu could be operated from amphibious assault ships and the like. It was known as the "Truck of the Sea". This model was armed with field artillery and machine guns, a literal "Armed Daihatsu". It is best at supporting landing operations but has very limited effectiveness against PT boats. There were plenty of other versions modified with field upgrades.
