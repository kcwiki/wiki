==Trivia==
* [[Spring 2014 Event]]
* Refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Wake_Island Wake Island]
* Her theme tune, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gt2rY8cYcE "Operation Capture Pheasant Island"] is a hint at the Japanese name for Wake Island Torishima which means Bird Island.
*'''Type 3 Shell''' deals more damage to her. This is a reference to the bombardment of Henderson Field by Kongou and Haruna where Kongou fired over 100 Sanshiki-dan at the airfield [http://www.combinedfleet.com/kongo.htm Link.]
*Due to her being an airfield, Torpedos won't reach her.
*Damage text is different from others:
**Slightly damaged(小破) →　Confused(混乱)
**Moderately damaged(中破) →　Damaged(損害)
**Heavily damaged(大破) → Broken(損壊)
**Sunken(撃沈) →　Destroyed(破壊)
