==Origin and Development==

The Sasebo event was done not over night as the entire process of the event took approximately 2 and half years of hard work that came from the hard work of a dedicated group of KanColle fans in the Sasebo area as they were attempting to find a way convince the citizens of thier town to help revitalize the tourism in Sasebo. 

After lots of hard work they were able to establish contact with [[C2 Kikan]] and began setting up plans that lead to successfully establish this tour event.

Below here are the words of the main project leader "Fin" who tells in his words about his account of everything he did to help make this project become a reality.

''I am just going to write something here. I am one of the Kancolle event organizer, it took 2 and a half years to achieve what we see today. The effort to explain to the elders what is Kancolle is hard to imagine for those who've never done it.''

''"Kancolle? What is that an anime?" such expression, I've heard it from people countless times. "No, It is a game that is played on the web browser on computer" I explained. For people lacking the concept of computer games, naturally they won't understand how popular this game is among the youngsters.''

''Explanation, presentation, tenaciously continuing to do this, doing this project which other people think is a waste of time. I felt like an outcast, but the reason I didn't give up was because of partial confidence that "this project can work!" After that a few people agreed with my idea.''

''Those pepole are people that really like Kancolle. Although I only have 1 married ship, among them a lot have multiple married ships. They suggested that they wanted to make something that they wanted to see, so they took this suggestion to C2 facility and hence the circle involved in the Sasebo event.''

''I can only thank C2 facility who responded to this passion of us. Although SomeP (a person) was criticized on multiple sides, but when he knew about our real feelings, he gave us help without mentioning the cost/at any cost. And the result is the "Chinjyufu" book for those Admirals who came to Sasebo.''

''Communicating with C2 was an unintentional suggestion by people inside the project. Previous event to lure customers/tourists (to Sasebo) all failed, but we did not give out this time, and the project was moving forward step by step.''

''Even so, we still have no money. We tried to open a tuition to earn some money, but really we can't even get enough funding. Hence, all the bento are hand-made. I lowered my head to ask for money from multiple sources, finally get 5 figure funding, securing the wages of volunteers and the venue.''

''Dear admirals, if you went on the Sasebo event homepage, you can see that it is one of our people who burn the midnight oil to make it fully represent the concept of "hand made feel" of Kantai Collection.''

''Those Kujuku Islands rice cracker are packed by us ourselves day and night after they are manufactured The amount is not that big due to financial constraint.
But, up to this step, those who didn't care about the project started to tell me "Wild(the author) since you are already working this hard, let us help too"''

''Even then, "There will never be so many people who will come to Sasebo" "It would still be fine if you can only do it in Sasebo" "What if someone is hurt? Who will be responsible?" types of phrases were still thrown at me. I feel like Isoroku Yamamoto at the time when he made the suggestion to attack Pearl Harbor.''

''But what made all these doubts went was all the ttks. To be honest with you, when I see people lining up orderly in the square, listening to the instruction of the staffs, I cried for real. What I've done, what I'll be doing, they are not wrong. I express my sincerest gratitude to you admirals.''

''After this I don't know what will happen to (future) sasebo event, everything depends on the IP holders. It is also not possible to do volunteer for Sasebo forever, a lot of changes will happen. But, under that blue sky after the storm, having a fun time in Sasebo and leaving a wonderful memory, is the biggest wish of Kancolle fans.''

'''''--Fin'''.''

==Promotional Material and Stamp Rally==
On the day of the live event, normal travelers and tourist who traveled to Sasebo would arrive to find out that many locations today would be displaying KanColle content all over. This especially applied to some of the major burger joints located near the Sasebo Naval Base where the main part of the attraction was taking place.

Around various locations, there were images of [[Ise]], [[Akagi]], [[Shigure]], [[Isokaze]], [[Suzutsuki]], [[Yahagi]], [[Asashio]] and [[Akatsuki]] that were used to help promote the event. Historically these Kanmusu are closely affiliated with this event due to the fact their original ship counterparts were built in this location. 

In addition, people who took a tour via bus would be surprised when they hear [[Shigure]] come on the speaker when it reaches a particular location to give them a guided tour about the location they were in[https://twitter.com/masmichan/status/974793163926749184?s=19]. And in addition, noted about some of the attraction in the area while trying to convince the tourists to go check them out. 

Finally, there was also a stamp rally that took place where people have to go visit 4 of the major Sasebo burger joints in the area to earn a stamp from each store. Once you collected all the stamps you would be rewarded with a [[Shigure]] Clear File. In addition, eating at one of the burger joints also netted you additional KanColle merchandise which included illustrated cards and coasters which varied depending on the store.

==Piano Concert==
Prior to the Sasebo Event, there were tickets that were sold to attend the piano concert at the Sasebo Concert Hall near the Naval Base. On the 17th, the main performance took place where approximately 800 ticket buyer attended the concert.

Reports noted that there was 2 pianists who came out to play KanColle music cosplaying as [[Kaga]] and [[Akagi]].

During the performance the pianist played various KanColle music over the course of the recital. Over the course of the performance there were some people that came out dressed as Kongou-class sisters and admirals that danced along with the music. Eventually at the finale, they played the song [[Moonlit Sea]] which the seiyuu [[Tanibe Yumi]] came out to sing while cosplaying as [[Shigure]]. The performance was noted to be really good by all of those who attended the show.

==Chinjufu Vol.2==
'''Chinjufu Vol.2''' served as C2's main selling piece for the live event. This would be the first time in 8 years since there was a continuation to the series (Vol.1 was sold back in June 2010). People who came on the '''March 17-18, 2018''' could purchase this book from the official sale stands. This book's main purpose was to promote and educate everyone about '''Sasebo Naval Base''', the past history of the Naval Base, information about the city of Sasebo and the major food attraction it has there. While this book was nothing KanColle related, the book did however feature some characters in it such as [[Akashi]], [[Gambier Bay]], [[Yahagi]] and others.
