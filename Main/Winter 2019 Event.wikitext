The '''"Winter 2019 Event"''', '''Interception! Operation Buin Defense''' is scheduled to begin on the '''December 26th, 2018''', on the day following Christmas and will be a small scale event. Given it's size the likely length of the event, it will last till '''Jaunary 22nd, 2019'''

The known details based on what [[Kensuke Tanaka]] mentioned in his interview about the Event of the event will be based around the Central Solomon Islands where Rabaul will be providing air support for the campaign. What is known is that the Campaign will begin from Buin as you take a rat transport fleet through the [[Wikipedia:Battle of Blackett Strait|Battle of Blackett Strait]], following this will be an intense air battle where Rabaul Airbase will provide suppot with its' Land Based Planes and Carrier based planes, and then finally a transportation operation to provide support for Buin Anchorage.

It's been noted that while this event will only be 3 maps big, the main difficulty will come for players playing Normal or Hard Difficulty. They also encourage players to train torpedo squadrons and prepare your air forces for this event. Surface Radars will be the key to success to the first map, while having strong LBAS planes are vital for the later maps.

There will be a total of 4 new ships that will be released with this event.

==Mechanics==
===Participation requirements===
*Must have a 75% sortie win ratio.
*Must have 5 empty ship slots for new ships.
*Must have 20 free equipment slots.

===Special Mechanics===
#The difficulty system first used in [[Spring 2015 Event]] returns: you can choose between Operation A ({{lang|ja|甲}}, Hard), Operation B ({{lang|ja|乙}}, Medium), Operation C ({{lang|ja|丙}}, Easy) or Operation D ({{lang|ja|丁}}, Very Easy) .
#*Choosing A or B requires certain HQ Level (HQ Lv 35 for B / 80 for A in Spring 2015 Event).
#*'''An important note''' to all Admirals intending to clear the event on Hard difficulty - further (new) conditions now apply:'''
#**When switching difficulty from ''any other difficulty'' to Hard, the map's debuff mechanism (where applicable) will be reset.
#***Switching between any other difficulties will not reset the debuff mechanism.
#The debuff system from [[Summer 2015 Event]]'s final map, where certain nodes had to be killed to reduce boss armor will return.
# Returning this event will allow a fleet with '''seven''' ships ('''[[Striking Force Fleet]]''') to sortie to certain event maps that allow '''single fleet operations''' starting from '''E-2''', and also includes the '''final''' map of the event.
#*The Striking Force '''cannot''' be sortied during exercises or sent on expeditions while it contains seven ships.
#*The Striking Force can only be created and used in the '''third''' fleet in the menu (out of a total of four fleets).
#*A Striking Force with a flagship that carries a new piece of equipment, the '''Striking Force Fleet Command Facility''', will be able to make use of the new '''Single Ship Evacuation''' mechanic.
#**The new Single Ship Evacuation mechanic that will become available for the Striking Force as of E-4 allowing a single ship in the fleet to retreat from the battlefield after an enemy engagement if she suffered heavy damage.
#***It is possible for the damage to become even worse during a Single Ship Evacuation.
#***Unlike the Combined Fleet's evacuation mechanic, it does not require an escort destroyer.
#**The new Striking Force Fleet Command Facility will become obtainable and useable via the old [[Fleet Command Facility]] and the '''Action Report''' that can be earned in the upcoming Fall Event. The [[Fleet Command Facility]], as well as the new Action Report item, will be obtainable on all difficulty levels, including Medium and Easy Mode.
#**Supplementary information regarding the new [[Striking Force Fleet Command Facility]] and the Single Ship Evacuation it allows when carried by the striking force's flagship:
#***The evacuation does not require an escort destroyer.
#***The evacuation consumes the ship's entire fuel & ammo reserves. 
#***Only one ship can be evacuated per battle.
#***'''The damage the ship suffered may become worse during the evacuation, but she will never sink.'''
# Returning this event, the '''Vanguard Formation''' can be used .
#*This formation will organize the fleet such that the 3rd-6th/7th ships protect the Flagship and 2nd Ship of the Fleet.
#**In addition, the formation allows for ships to become more evasive in combat situations, especially with well-trained Destroyer.
#** This formation is also available '''only during the duration of the event.'''
#**The formation will be usable by [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/930623111862435841 both] normal fleets as well as the Striking Force Fleet.
#'''New:''' '''NPC Friend Fleets''' have been introduced into the game.
#* Friend Fleets act as another unit that appears in particular battles to help aid your fleet when attacking the enemy at the start of night battle.
#** NPC Friend Fleets are selected from a randomized preset list of ship.
#** Depending on who you have in your fleet can also influence who will be arrive to aid you in battle.
#'''New:''' '''Enemy Radar Ambush Nodes''' is introduced into the game.
#* Entering this node will result in your fleet facing off against an enemy fleet that will ambush and attack your fleet 
#** Your Fleet will not be able to fight against the enemy Fleet.
#** By meeting certain conditions, you can evade these nodes.

'''The following guide is an early version of the guide. Please use at your own discretion until it is further updated.'''

'''About Ambush Nodes'''
[[File:Ambush Nodes.png|right|thumb|ambush node]]
On this event map, player will get to experience a new mechanic known as an '''Enemy Ambush Node'''.
There nodes are generally encountered only if your fleet meet specific conditions which redirect them along a path to this node. Similar to the way LoS check are done in maps. 

For this event, '''Ambush Nodes''' mainly occur if your fleet does not meet the Surface Radar requirements and if you land on one, you will enter a battle.

During these battle, your fleet will not participate in attacking the enemy fleet, but the enemy will attempt to attack your fleet. Your will consume 4% of it's total fuel in the sequence. 

It's recommended to try to do what you can to avoid hitting these nodes as much as possible. 

This map is divided into 2 phase, a Transportation phase and a Killing phase. Both objectives will need to be completed in order to complete this map. 

Most battle in this map mainly consist of simple fights which will pit your fleet up to 4 enemy ships mainly consisting of subs, DDs or CLs mixed with DDs. Most of these fights can be won easily, espcially with an expeirenced fleet. For this guide, the focus will be on the boss nodes and requirements needed for completing the objectives.


'''Phase 1- Transportation through the Blackket Strait'''

'''Recommended Composition'''

'''1 CL, 4 DD or 5 DD'''

'''Route: B-C-E-F-G'''

Have your fleet drum and Daihatsu, but keep a balance between combat and TP gear to get the best outcome to deplete the TP gauge. The TP phase here is small so completing should only take a short while to do. 

Boss is a Tsu-class with Destroyers and should be overall easy to S rank if you equip your fleet properly. It is also possible to use a Boss support fleet here and load your fleet with only drums and Daihatsu to maximize your TP gain which cam make it possible to complete it in as short as 2 runs.

'''Phase 2 - Battle Against the Abyssal Nimbus Princess'''

'''Recommended Composition'''

'''Casual and Easy - 1 CAV, 1 CLT, 4DD (2 Surface Radars needed to complete the objective)'''<br>
'''Normal and Hard - 1 CL, 5 DD (1 historical ship + 5 Surface Radars needed to complete the objective)'''

'''Route: B-H-C-L'''

To be able to reach the boss node, your fleet will need to have radars equipped to each of them, from those radars you will need a certain amount of Surface Radars equipped on your ships along with '''1 Surface Radar equipped on the flagship''' (2 (Easy) /5 (Medium+) Surface Radars overall needed) in order to reach Node L. 

Players on Easy and Casual will need heavier ships along with a '''flagship with a surface radar''' to being directed to the boss and avoid being tossed into the dead end node or getting stuck in ambush nodes. Easy will need 1 CA(V)+CLT while Casual will need 2 CAV+1CLT.

Once your fleet reached the boss will battle the [[Abyssal Nimbus Princess]] who will consist of herself + 3 CL and 2 other DDs. The fight is simple, but having a Boss Support Fleet will help make it easier to concentrate on attacking the boss herself. As such, a ''' Boss Support Fleet''' is recommended for this map.

In addition to this, ships from the '''Asashio-class, Shiratsuyu-class , and Yura''' all can deliver a damage modifier to the Nimbus Princess which consist of a value of '''1.3x the normal damage value'''.

Murasame can deliver '''1.5x the normal damage value'''.

Bringing a few ships from this group should easily help you win the battle even with double attack shelling. However, if you face complication with the boss, bringing in a DD with Torpedo Cut ins can be an alternative.

* [[Verniy]], [[Naka]], [[Inazuma]], [[Ushio]] [[Furutaka]], [[Murakumo]], [[Fubuki]], [[Yuugumo]], [[Naganami]] - 1.3x  modifier bonus

Because of this, many can be useful here, but please weigh your decisions carefully especially if your are playing normal + as you will have 2 tags to deal with  and some also have benefits in the final node.

'''Phase 1 - Killing the Heavy Cruiser Princess'''

'''Recommended Fleet'''

'''1FBB, 1 CAV, 1 CA, 1 CVL, 2 DD'''

'''Path A-B-F-G-J-K'''

'''1CAV, 2-3 CA, 0-1 CL, 2 DD'''

'''Path  D-F-G-J-K'''

'''Recommended LBAS'''

'''LBAS 1+2'''<br>
'''Node K - 4 LBAS Bombers / Torpedo Bombers''' (Distance of 5 needed) 

The first comp (1FBB, 1 CAV, 1 CA, 1 CVL, 2 DD) will have you face off against an air raid, a sub fleet, and 2 torpedo squadrons before reaching the boss. Most of the enemies here are easy to deal with. 

It's recommended to bring an AACI ship to deal with the air raid but otherwise most nodes are easy to deal with. And to reach the boss node, you will need to bring a sufficient amount of '''Surface RADARs''' (0/2/3/4) to go to the boss. 

The  second Comp (1CAV, 2-3 CA, 0-1 CL, 2 DD) will help you avoid the sub node and air strike node all together and only have to deal with a few surface battles against some DD, CL and CAs. Using this fleet may preset some challeges if any DD or CL survives shelling phase so Vangaurd formation may be considered for possible protection along the route. Bringing a single Seaplane fighter should also be more than enough to gain AS+ at boss. Keep in mind however that '''because you'll use extra CAs that segment, if you choose this comp for Normal or Hard, you may end up locking out potential CAs ships for phase 2. So please weigh your choices carefully before entering this as you will be using a CVL for unlocking the 2nd path either way.

You will also need to bring a sufficient amount of '''Surface RADARs''' (0/2/3/4) to go to the boss. 

The boss node itself features a [[Heavy Cruiser Princess]] who will be accompanied by a few other CAs, CL and DD. Because she has no air power, it'll be easy for your LBAS using only bombers and can wipe a good number of the enemy units with minimal effort. 

If you bring in a ship or two that has a modifier bonus to the map, you can clear this segment relatively easily. However place consider who you brig prior to entering the fight as you may consider some for Phase 2.

'''Phase 2 - Killing the [[Southern War Demon]]'''

'''Part 1 - Unlocking the Combined Fleet Path'''
 
'''Recommended Fleet'''

'''1FBB, 1 CAV, 1 CA, 1 CVL, 2 DD'''<br>
'''6SS(V)''' (about 2-3 SSV required)

'''Surface Fleet Path'''<br>
'''Path A-B-F-G-I-L-M-N'''

'''SS(V) path'''<br>
'''Path D-E-F-G-I-L-M-N'''
'''Recommended LBAS'''

'''Node A Clearing'''<br>
'''LBAS 1'''<br>
'''Node A - 4 Fighters ''' (Distance of 2 needed) 

'''Node L Clearing'''<br>
'''LBAS 1'''<br>
'''Node L - 4 Fighters ''' (Distance of 5 needed) 

'''Node A & L Clearing'''<br>
'''LBAS 1+2'''<br>
'''Node L - 4 Fighters ''' (Distance of 2 and 5 needed) 

'''LBAS 2'''<br>
'''Node I - 4 Torpedo Bomber/LBAS Bombers ''' (Distance of 4 needed) 

'''Node N Clearing'''<br>
'''LBAS 1'''<br>
'''Node L - 4 Fighters ''' (Distance of 7 needed) 

'''LBAS 2'''<br>
'''Node M - 4 Torpedo Bomber/LBAS Bombers ''' (Distance of 6 needed)


'''Node N Clearing (alterative)'''<br>
'''LBAS 1+2'''<br>
'''Node L - 4 Fighters ''' (Distance of 7 needed)  

''Scoring Perfect Defense at Land Base'''<br>
'''LBAS 1+2'''<br>
'''Based Defense - 4 Intercetors/Fighters or 3 Intercetors/Fighters + 1 Saiun'''

In this phase, you will need to gain air control over various points in the map (Nodes A, L, and N) along with successfully protecting your Land Base from taking any daamge to gain access to your 2nd starting point in which your Combined fleet can used at. 

The fleet you can use here can be the same as Phase 1's fleet, but if you didn't use a CVL you may consider bringing one for this segment), but also if you have enough Subs and seaplane carrying subs you can consider bringing them here to help traverse the path to the nodes more easily. On higher difficulties, if you use a surface fleet you may need to use your CVL and CAVs as fighter mules to help secure your AS as the specific nodes mentioned above.

Depending on the difficulty the following process will need to be done:
Casual - ???
Easy - AS Node A + Perfect Defense on Land Base Air Raid
Normal -  AS Node A and L + Perfect Defense on Land Base Air Raid
Hard -  AS Node A, L, and N + Perfect Defense on Land Base Air Raid (1-2 times needed)

Keep in mind that you will need to have your '''LBAS travel to nodes A, N and L and score AS with your LBAS participating''' at these nodes in order to count to completing the requirements.

Perfect defense will simply require you to use Fighters/ Interceptors to wipe out the bombers and take 0 damage from it.

On Hard mode, your biggest difficulty will be to over come the Ru-class node (Node I) BB Princess node (Node M), so if necessary bring an LBAS bomber group to Nodes I and M to take out some of the enemies there to improve your chances of passing.

If you choose to try to pass requirements by concentrating just on the nodes without bringing LBAS nodes for Node I and M, remember that there nodes will be much harder to pass.

Once all conditions are complete the new starting point should appear and you will be able to use your combined fleet.

'''Part 2 - Killing the [[Southern War Demon]]'''

'''Recommended Fleet'''<br>
'''2(F)BB, 2CAV, 2 CA + 1 CL, 2 CA, 2DD, 1 CLT'''

'''Path Q-I-L-M-N-P'''

'''Recommended LBAS'''

'''Boss Node LBAS'''
'''LBAS 1'''<br>
'''Boss Node - 2 Fighters/1 Land Base Bomber/ 1 Flying Boat ''' (Distance of 8 needed) 

'''LBAS 2'''<br>
'''Boss Node - 1-2 Fighters/1-2 Land Base Bomber/ 1 Flying Boat ''' (Distance of 8 needed) 

For this path, your fleet will have to go through a fleet of PT imps, several raid raids, and some battles against some Battleships (including Battleship Princesses). Depending on the battle a in-route support fleet may be recommended to help clear out the battleships along the way.  Alternatively you can also resort to using [[Nelson]] and her Nelson Touch or [[Nagato|Nagato Kai Ni]] and her broadside attack to help clear out the Battleship Princesses. If you have both of them carefully consider who you choose to bring for your fleet. [[Nelson]] is recommended to E-2 since she's mainly useful in surface task force while [[Nagato|Nagato Kai Ni]] is more usable in E-3 due to her strong broadside attack which is more crucial for taking down E-3's boss. In either case, one of them needs to be reserved for E-3 which depending on the comp you choose and who you reserve will greatly affect what you'll do on higher difficulties on E-3. In-route boss support is preferred to ensure your survival along this path.

Bringing a AACI ship is highly recommended for the Air Battles.

Once you reach the boss node, you will face a considerable amount of air power, if you have enough seaplane fighters (about 6-8 on hard, less on lower difficulties) it will be possible along with you LBAS to score Air Superiority or Air Parity making it much easier to win the battle. If for some reason you lack in seaplane fighters, you may suffer Air Denial which will make things harder, but may be still possible to win. While this would be considered bad in most situations, thanks to the boss and her mostly weak fleet, this battle is much easier to complete. Along with the assistance of LBAS, it should be easy to clear with minimal effort. However if necessary, bring a boss support fleet. 


'''Alternative (Part 2) - Unlocking U-M (Not Recommended)'''

'''4CVL, 2CAV + 1 CL, 1CA, 2DD, 2 FBB

'''Path: R-U-V-W''' (If enough surface radars air equipped)

'''Node R and V wit LBAS'''
'''LBAS 1'''<br>
''' 4 Fighters''' (Distance of 4 and 6 needed) 

For this alternative step, you will need to complete the following conditions: 

* AS R and V with LBAS
* S rank Node W Twice

Path is is simple to complete but you will face a battle against a [[Battleship Re-Class]] which can be problematic especially on higher difficulties. Otherwise using your LBAS to get AS on Node of R and V should be easy and once you get to node W, completing the task shouldn't be too hard as there are mainly transports there.

Once complete, you'll unlock the path to from node U to M.

'''Alternative (Part 3) Unlocking M-P (Not Recommended)'''

Most of the requirements to complete this step will required using previous compositions and LBAS set ups  to complete certain requirements, however tests to determine the exact way to unlock this path is not fully known. Below are the lists of what has been documented to possibly unlock the path.

* AS+ at Node L, N and R with LBAS
* 2x Perfect Defense
* 3 S-Ranks at Node Q (verification required)
* A-Rank the boss node twice, once from Node R, once from Node Q (Verification required)

Once you complete the conditions, you will unlock the path from M-P

'''Alternative (Part 4) Killing the [[Southern War Demon]] via U-M-P shortcut (Not Recommended)'''

'''2(F)BB, 2CAV, 2 CVL + 1 CL, 2 CA, 2DD, 1 CLT'''

'''Pat: R-U-L-M-P'''

'''Boss Node LBAS'''
'''LBAS 1'''<br>
'''Boss Node - 2 Fighters/1 Land Base Bomber/ 1 Flying Boat ''' (Distance of 8 needed) 

'''LBAS 2'''<br>
'''Boss Node - 1 Fighters/2 Land Base Bomber/ 1 Flying Boat ''' (Distance of 8 needed) 

This comp will allow you to bring a larger air power to the boss, however you will have to face off against a Re-class node (Node U) and the Battle Princess Node (Node M). Both of these nodes are difficult to over take compared to taking the CAV route through the PT imp nodes.

As such we personally don't recommend this comp unless you have a fear of PT imps and would rather be taking on Re-class and BB Princesses. If you do make it to the boss, you will likely get AS at boss making the fight even easier. 

As a reminder, '''please consider the normal recommendation before even considering the alternative recommendation as it is more trouble than it's worth.'''

'''The following guide is an early version of the guide. Please use at your own discretion until it is further updated.'''

In this map, you will be taking a large number of tasks in order to complete this operation. Depending on the difficulty, different things will be required in order to complete the map. Below are the following main conditions you'll need to complete in order to successfully complete this operation:

# Complete the '''[[Transport Operation]]'''
# Unlocking '''ZZ Node''' and improving the Buffing the '''[[Abyssal Sun Princess]]''' weakness debuff
#* Complete the Air Node requirements
#* Gain Perfect Defense Twice
#* Defeat the '''[[Southern War Princess]]''' Fleet with an S rank
# Defeat the '''[[Abyssal Sun Princess]]'''

In addition to this,there are also a sizeable team of historical ships that are tied to the area which are strong at both nodes boss nodes Which includes the following:

'''E-3 (Pre ZZ/Post ZZ Unlock)'''<br>
* [[Isokaze]], [[Hagikaze]], [[Arashi]]: 1.77/2x modifier bonus
* [[Kawakaze]] - 1.43x/1.65x modifier bonus
* [[Shigure]], [[Yukikaze]], [[Hatsushimo]], [[Shiratsuyu]], [[Tanikaze]], [[Urakaze]], [[Shiranui]], [[Kagerou]], [[Hamakaze]], [[Naganami]] - 1.3/1.5x modifier bonus
* [[Yuudachi]], [[Ayanami]], [[Akizuki]], [[Asashio]], [[Kasumi]], [[Hatsuzuki]], [[Ooshio]] - 1.3x/1.3x modifier bonus
* [[Sendai]], [[Myoukou]], [[Haguro]] - 1.25x/1.25x modifier bonus

'''Phase 1 - Complete the Transport Operation'''

'''Recommended Fleet''' <br>
* '''1CAV, 1CL, 4DD''' (0/3/4/5 Surface Radar)
* '''2CA(V), 1 CL, 3DD''' (0/3/4/5 Surface Radar) 
* '''1CV, 1CL, 4DD''' (0/3/4/5 Surface Radar)

'''Path: A-F-E-I-L-S-P'''

'''Recommended LBAS'''

'''Node E and/or L (LBAS 1)'''

* '''4 Torpedo Bombers/4 Land Base Bombers''' (Distance of 3 or 5 Required)

'''Node S Boss Node (LBAS 2+3)'''

* '''1 Fighter + 3 Torpedo Bombers/3 Land Base Bombers (LBAS 2)''' (Distance of 7 required)
* '''4 Torpedo Bombers/4 Land Base Bombers (LBAS 3)''' (Distance of 7 required)

During the Transport Operation, your fleet will have to go through several air node battles where AACI will be needed. In addition to this, your fleet will engage against a few surface battles where you face several Destroyers, Light Cruisers, and Heavy Cruisers. Depending on the fleet you go either line ahead or vanguard formation. 
 
As long as you bring the required surface radars (0/3/4/5) to you should be able to avoid the ambush node. 

Most of the comp as long as you bring 1CL and 3 DD should reach the boss fleet but otherwise depending on what other ships you bring may affect how much TP you gain from the map.

A general recommendation is to bring at least 2-3 ships that can carry drums and Daihatsu while keeping the other ships with a suitable amount of combat and LoS gear. 

You will need a considerable amount of LoS gear (2 seaplane scouts + 5 radars noted in hard) to be able to route to the boss. 

The boss node will consist of a [[Southern Princess]] along with some Tsu-class CL, and some DDs. Bringing at least 1 fighter plane in your LBAS should help net an easy AS if you bring a ship that can bring a single fighter into battle. All other LBAS planes can focus on bombing and should be able to wipe out most of the enemy ships in the fleet.

A good strong historical bonus ship team or Torpedo Cut in should be effective in taking down the boss without minimal effort. With enough TP it should be possible to clear the first part in several runs.  

Once the TP gauge is depleted the path to the next boss will be open.

'''Phase 2 - Unlocking the Path to ZZ'''

In this segment, you will be mainly using your fleet to complete a large series of tasks which will require you to change your fleet across sections along with your LBAS to meet specific requirements so you can meet the following conditions: 

#* Complete the Air Node requirements 
#* Gain Perfect Defense at your Land Base Once/Twice
#* Defeat the '''[[Southern War Princess]]''' Fleet with an S rank

Each of these conditions will vary upon difficulty and will ask you to successfully complete them if you wish to unlock the shortcuts.

'''Part 1 - Scoring an S rank against the '''[[Southern War Princess]] in Node S'''


'''Fleet and LBAS Recommendations'''

'''Same as Phase 1'''

'''Path: A-F-E-I-L-S-P'''

For defeating the [[Southern War Princess]] in this segment, all process is done the same way as you would do in the transport segment except you won't need drums or Daihatsu as you are past this segment. All process be the same and bringing boss node support may help complete the process faster. 

'''Part 2 - Complete the Air Node requirements'''

In this segment, you will be taking your fleet to various air nodes and depending on the difficulty you will need to complete the following conditions:

'''Score Air Supremacy on the following nodes:'''

* Casual: Nodes '''F and K'''
* Easy: Nodes '''D,F,I,K, and T'''
* Normal: Nodes '''D,F,I,K,N and T'''
* Hard: Nodes '''D,F,I,K,N,T, and *U'''

'''<nowiki>*</nowiki>Node U only need Air Superiority'''

'''Submarine Approach (for nodes D, F, I, K, N, and T) '''

'''Recommended Fleet'''

* '''5-6 SS(V)''' (4 SSV recommended)

'''Recommended LBAS'''

'''LBAS 1-3'''

* 4 Fighters''' (Up to a Range of 5 needed)


'''Path:'''

* '''A-F-E-B-H-I'''
* '''A-C-D-G-K-O-N'''
* '''A-C-D-G-J-T'''

This method is recommended for players who own a large number of seaplane fighters (about 7-8 for Hard) and want to successfully complete most of the requirements without having to blow through a large number of resources doing so. 

Most of the nodes should be reachable with submarines and for hard mode can cover almost all major node points with the except for '''Node U'''.

This method will require multiple runs with all your LBAS concentrating on one point per run to successfully score AS+. If done correctly, your subs should easily gain AS+ with the 7-8 Seaplane fighters. Once done, retreat and repeat at each node until all conditions are met in set locations

Additional Notes to be taken are:

Be warned that an all submarine fleet has the risk of going to '''Node B  from Node E''' While the enemy DDs will show animations of them shelling your subs, the '''damage they will do to your fleet will be the same as an ASW attack'''. It's highly recommended to '''not take your submarines past node E if they are critically damaged, as they will be at risk of sinking!'''

All other nodes (Besides U) can be reachable by subs and can get there without the risk of sinking (besides Node I's path which is the only one that presents the risk of possible sinking.)

'''Single Fleet Air Control Approach (Node F and I)'''

'''Recommended Fleet''' <br>
* '''1CV, 1CAV 1CL, 3DD''' (0/3/4/5 Surface Radar)

'''Path:'''

* '''A-F-E-I'''

'''Recommended LBAS'''

'''LBAS 1-3'''

* 4 Fighters''' (Up to a Range of 5 needed)

This will have your fleet take the very same path as you took in the prior path during the transport phase, the only main difference is you'll be using a fighter mule fleet to gain AS on the nodes F and I. By bringing enough fighter planes, this should be easily achieved once you get past node E. 

'''Carrier Task Force Air Control Approach (Node D, K, T, and U)'''

'''Recommended Fleet''' <br>
*'''Carrier Task Force'''
** '''4CV(B), 2BB + 1 CL, 2DD, 3XX'''

'''Path:'''

* '''A-C-D-G-K'''
* '''A-C-D-G-J-T-U'''

'''Recommended LBAS'''

'''LBAS 1-3'''

* 4 Fighters''' (Up to a Range of 6 needed)

With this method, using a fleet of standard carriers or armored carriers will allow your fleet to bring a significant amount of air power without having to resort to organizing a set of carriers as fighter mules. If you use them along with an LBAS or 2, you can gain AS from almost all the nodes along the path. 

Your two major threats will be the [[New Submarine Princess]] and the Surface Fleet on Node J. So if necessary, bring in some pre-ASW capable ships to help make your way through node C and hope the enemy fleet you engage in node J is not present in a line ahead formation and the likely hood you'll survive the route to reach all the major node points will be easily achieved. 

'''Transport Combined Fleet Air Control Approach (Node N)'''

'''Recommended Fleet''' <br>
*'''Transport Combined Fleet'''
** '''(2BBV/2CAV/1AV,CVL), 4DD + 1 CL, 3DD, 2XX'''

'''Path:'''

* '''A-C-D-G-K-O-N'''

'''Recommended LBAS'''

'''LBAS 1-3'''

* 4 Fighters''' (Up to a Range of 5 needed)

Arguably the most difficult path you will need to face in the map. The main threats of this map will be Nodes C and O. Which will have a [[New Submarine Princess]] (Node C) and [[Battleship Princess]] (Node O)

Your (2BBV/2CAV/1AV,CVL) will need to be full fighter mules and bringing a team of per-emptive ASW DD/DEs can help you survive the trip along the ways. However, the battleship princess node will present the biggest issue as their fleet will likely be able to land hits on your ships and the risk of possible critical damage is strong, especially for the main fleet. Hope you get by with moderate damage or use damage control as a form of insurance on some ships to take the move to Node N. 

Bringing In route support can be recommended to help reduce the likely hood that the enemy DDs in the fleet will present a risk.

If you brought all your fighter planes and LBAS fighters to this node, gaining AS+ should make this an easily done.


'''Part 3 - Scoring Perfect Defense on the Land Base Air Strike'''

'''Recommended Fleet''' <br>

*'''5-6 XX''' (submarines preferred)


'''Recommended LBAS'''

'''LBAS 1-3'''

* 4 Interceptors/Fighters''' 

In this segment, you will simply need to get a '''Successful Perfect Defense on the Land Base Air Raid''' (Once on '''Easy or lower'''/ Twice on '''Normal or Higher''') Just take your fleet out until the air raid siren play which will cue the LBAS air raid, hope your interceptors and fighters wipe out or eliminate all incoming planes and you get a White Text indicating you successfully defended your base. Repeat if necessary until conditions are met. 

Once all conditions are met, '''the path to ZZ is open and most of the ships with historical buffs will become much stronger following the unlocking.'''


'''Phase 3 - Killing the [[Abyssal Sun Princess]]]'''

'''Recommended Fleet''''<br>
*'''Surface Task Force'''
**'''2-3 BB,0-1CV,2-3 CAV,0-1 AV, 0-1 LAH +  1 CL, 2CA, 0-1 CLT, 2-3 DD''' (3/4/5/6 Surface Radars)
**'''2-3 BB,0-1CV,1-2 CAV,0-1 AV,,0-1 CVL, 0-1 LAH +  1 CL, 2CA, 0-1 CLT, 2-3 DD''' (6/7/8/9 Surface Radars)

'''Path:'''<br>
'''A-C-D-G-J-T-ZZ-Z'''

*'''Carrier Task Force'''
**'''2 BB, 4CV + 1 CL, 2-3 XX, 2-3 DD'''

'''Path:'''<br>
'''A-C-D-G-J-T-U-W-Z'''

'''Recommended LBAS'''

'''ASW LBAS (Node C and ZZ)''' (Optional, but recommended)

*'''LBAS 1'''
**'''3-4 Toukai/3 ASW Bombers + 1 Flying Boat''' (Range 7 Required)

'''Boss Node LBAS'''

*'''LBAS 1-3'''

*'''LBAS #1 and #2'''
** '''2 Fighters + 1 Land Base Bomber + 1 Flying boat / Land Base Recon Plane''' (Range 8 Required)


*'''LBAS #3'''
** '''1 Fighters + 2 Land Base Bomber + 1 Flying boat / Land Base Recon Plane''' (Range 8 Required)

'''Regarding Surface Task Force Method'''

In this final phase of the operation, the path to the boss to relatively simple, but your fleet will face some difficult confrontations along the way, namely the [[New Sub Princess]] who will appear in '''Node C and ZZ'''.

Depending on the difficulty, she may be easier to bypass on lower difficulties, but on higher difficulties will be very difficult to pass without the assistance of ASW support in the form of an ASW LBAS, ASW support fleet and Pre-ASW capable ships.

Your main goal if you choose to use an ASW LBAS and support is to incapacitate the [[New Sub Princess]] so you can minimize the damage she can cause to your fleet. It may be more possible to pass through node C, but Node ZZ may present difficulty as you will have less fuel to evade so you may choose to use your ASW supports there.  

If you use a surface Task force fleet, also prepare to use ships like CAVs, AVs, or [[Akitsumaru]] as fighter mules (with possible a Surface radar on some). As you will need to sufficient air power along with your LBAS to overtake the boss fleet. During the chipping phase, you'll likely need 1-2 Fighter mules depending on the difficulty but will need to have up to 3 fighter mules on Hard on the final kill if you wish to aim for AS.

An alternative, you can consider bringing in a CV like [[Intrepid]] or [[Kaga]] in place of one BB to also fill the fighter power requirements without having to resort to additional surface radars. 

But if you really need the BBs and you will then have to resort to bringing a CVL which will then force you to bring an additional 3 radars (Totally to 9!) which might handicap your fleet. Carefully consider your options before using this method.

Also, the most recommended BBs to bring with you on this map is [[Nagato|Nagato Kai Ni]] and [[Mutsu]] along with another strong BB (Like [[Musashi]] or an equivalent) to help out. 

[[Nagato]] and [[Mutsu]] should be placed in the 1st and 2nd slot of your fleet as they are recommended to use '''Cruising Formation 2''' (Combined Fleet Double Line) at the boss in Node Z.

The most likely way you'll set you fleet up from 1st - 6th from each fleet will likely be along the lines of:

* Main Fleet: [[Nagato|Nagato Kai Ni]], [[Mutsu]], BB, 1-2 CAV, 0-1AV, [[Akitsumaru]]
* Escort Fleet: CL, 2 CA, 0-1CLT, 2-3DD

In addition, due to the requirements needed to reach node ZZ you will need to arm Nagato in a radar meaning she will need the following set up:

* 2 guns + 1 AP Shell + 1 Surface Radar

While this will prevent her from double attacking this will be needed for when you use '''[[Nagato]]'s Broadside Special Attack''' which along with [[Mutsu]] choosing '''Cruising Formation 2'''  will allow for both Nagato and Mutsu to do a very high amount of damage against the Princess Type Abyssals (Possibly instant killing [[Battleship Princess]]es and severely damaging the [[Abyssal Sun Princess]]) due to the significant buff the attack gets when using these two specific ships along with an AP shell equipped to both of them.

In addition to this, bring important historical ships like [[Isokaze]], [[Hagikaze]], [[Arashi]] and [[Kawakaze]] if you have them will allow them even more highly damage attacks to the escorts or to the [[Abyssal Sun Princess]] in night battle. If you lack in those, you can also resort to other ships like [[Sendai]] with a double attack, or [[Shigure]] and [[Yukikaze]] with a torpedo cut in which can deliver also an effective amount of damage. 

During the final kill, the [[Abyssal Sun Princess]] will get a buff to her armor, while her fleet will get an air power buff which will require you to buff up your air power and may possibly resort to more fighter mules for the final segment. Otherwise, most processes to taking her down will be the same as before.

If necessary, bring all 3 LBAS to the boss, but be prepared for possible complications from Node C and ZZ.

'''Regarding Carrier Task Force Method'''

For this method, your fleet will be taking a more brute force approach which in return will also have arrived at the boss with less fuel and ammo, but will need to only worry about LoS and less about radar requirements

Outside of Node C, your fleet's biggest concern will be Node W where you'll be pitted against a strong fleet consisting of [[Battleship Princess]]es, and some strong carriers which can include as possible [[Aircraft Carrier Princess]] on higher difficulties.

This node does present some difficulty passing through but if feel you can take on several princesses and survive only to fight more at the boss, then be well prepared for this route. 

Gaining air power should be easy to do through this path and having [[Nagato]] and [[Mutsu]] taking the first and 2nd slots respectively can while using Cruising formation 2 will still allow you to use '''[[Nagato]]'s Broadside Special Attack''' which will still have effective results on the boss. Most other processes are the same here, but please weigh your decision before taking on this route due to the dangers you may face. 

'''What to do if you lack Nagato's Broadside Special'''

In situations where you don't have [[Nagato|Nagato Kai Ni]] or used her early on in another map, you will need to resort to using a '''Surface Task Force''' and use [[Nelson]] in flagship and 2 other BB in position 3 and 5 in the main fleet and resort to '''Nelson Touch''' which while is no where nearly as strong as Nagato's Broadside special can still work to a degree knocking out or somewhat damaging Princess type Abyssal and other units. Otherwise, you will need to hope you land solid hits on the enemies or resort to '''[[Friend Fleet]]s''' to clear out some of the threats for the final kill.

If you lack in either, you will have to just use line ahead and hope all conditions are met as you will need to hope you land and kill some princesses and other abyssal to hopefully have a shot to kill the [[Abyssal Sun Princess]].

Remember that in the end, a strong Friend Fleet and strong historical ships can also lead you to victory.

'''Regarding [[Friend Fleet]]s'''

'''Notice: As of this moment, there are only 2 Friend Fleets which are available at this time. Additional Friend Fleets are to arrive so this section will be updated once the new fleets are reviewed'''

Overall, there are a total of 2 fleet that can appear in Node Z which include:

* '''ASW Friend Fleet: [[Shinyou]], [[Etorofu]], [[Tsushima]]
* '''Destoryer Division 10: [[Kazagumo]], [[Akigumo]], [[Yuugumo]], [[Makigumo]] (Note: Kazagumo and Akigumo may arrive moderately  damaged at times)

The ASW Fleet is completely useless outside of chipping damage and cannot be replaced even if you put in the ships in said fleet.

Meanwhile, the 10th Destroyer Division all have buffs on this map which allow them to do a highly considerable amount of damage. So it's recommended to avoid placing in [[Kazagumo]], [[Akigumo]], [[Yuugumo]], and [[Makigumo]]to allow this fleet to appear and hope they arrive undamaged to get the best possible results from thier support.
