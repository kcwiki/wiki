==Limited Time Drop== 

Isokaze was made available for the duration of the Saury Mini Event during this time players who were unable to get her had a chance to own her if they attempted to play certain maps.

Isokaze was avalaible in the following locations if you do not own her.

*'''[[World 1#1-5|1-5]]''' : Node I (Boss Node)
*'''[[World 1#1-6|1-6]]''' : Node B 

Isokaze will only be available for a limited time during the duration of the mini event.

Once the event is over Isokaze will become unavailable outside of events.

==Notes==
* Pacific Saury and ship drops can be obtained at the same time.

* Raw Pacific Saury will not stay after the event. '''Remember to can or cook your fish if you do not want them to go to waste!'''
