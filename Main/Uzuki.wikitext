'''Kai'''
* Low firepower, torpedo, HP and armour.

===Fit Bonuses===
{{:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Equipment Bonuses}}
{{clear}}

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''

:At first remodel, she has low firepower and a decent torpedo stat, making her hitting harder in night battle than at day, but not great at either.
:While not impressive in combat, do keep in mind than many maps require you to bring at least a few destroyers for routing.

:Furthermore, destroyers are cheap to deploy and can equip [[Drum Canister]], making them suited for expeditions.
:In particular, she and her sister ships consume a little less ammo than your average DD, therefore increasing net resource gain.

:No further remodels have been implemented for her yet (as of January 2020). 



====Recommended Roles====
* Expeditions

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Surface combat

===Important Information===
* Required for A34, A66, B24, B60 and B72.

==Trivia==
**Due to a bug she was buildable for a few minutes after being added. She is currently unbuildable.
*She always says ''pyon'' because the first kanji in her name (卯) literally means "rabbit." ''Pyon'' is the Japanese onomatopoeia for a rabbit.
*She received a CG update on 2014/2/14 as the artist thought he was cutting corners in Uzuki's damaged portrait. 
**As with the [[:Category:Shiratsuyu_Class|Shiratsuyu class]], you can see both CGs in the Dex.
**The old Uzuki Kai CG can be seen [[:File:165M.jpg|here.]]
* Required by [[Quests#A34|A34]] and [[Quests#B24|B24]].
*Torpedoed December 12, 1944 northeast of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cebu Cebu], Philippines ([http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Uzuki_%281925%29&params=11_03_N_124_23_E_ 11°03′N 124°23′E])
*Her name is the name for the fourth month of the lunar calendar (April).
*Rescued the survivors of ''[[Kako]]'' where they washed up onto nearby islands after the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Savo_Island Battle of Savo Island].
**Her pin's design is the same as [[Kako]]'s hairclip. It is assumed Uzuki received it as a gift after she saved ''Kako'''s survivors.
*By September of 1942, ''[[Mutsuki]]'', ''[[Kisaragi]]'' and ''[[Yayoi]]'' were all lost in battle, so the [[Mutsuki Class]] was renamed to the Uzuki Class.
*As Uzuki herself says, by the end of the war, her Anti-air weaponry had been improved. 
**This is probably due to 10 out of 12 of the [[Mutsuki Class]] being lost during air raids.
*Uzuki's Rear mast snapped during a collision with ''[[Junyou]]'' after she resupplied [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeo_Kurita Admiral Kurita]'s fleet after the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf Battle of Leyte Gulf].
