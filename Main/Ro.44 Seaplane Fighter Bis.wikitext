==Introduction==
パスタの国で運用された信頼性と運動性に優れた複葉複座の水偵Ro.43を単座に改修した水上戦闘機です。低速なため戦闘機としては限界がありますが、貴重な洋上防空戦力として期待されました。本機は戦訓をフィードバックした同改修機です。

''A seaplane reconnaissance aircraft rebuilt from the [[Ro.43 Recon Seaplane|Ro. 43]] into a seaplane fighter with excellent mobility and reliability that was operated by the country of pasta.  Due to its slow speed it is somewhat limited as a fighter, however it can still be a valuable contributor to offshore air power.  This machine has been renovated and improved due to feedback from combat experience.''
