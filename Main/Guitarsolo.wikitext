=Introduction=
The term Guitarsolo refers to a specific Nightbattle Setup on Destroyers. It has been coined by DuskofDawn in this [https://www.reddit.com/r/kancolle/comments/fraos8/the_admirals_lounge/fm1iw8g/?context=3 thread] 

=Setup=

Outside of Tashkent, this requires you to have a [[Reinforcement Expansion]] on a 3-slot DD. Note that this setup only works on Destroyers.

The setup consists of a Small Main Calibre gun (preferrably D-Series) {{RedGunLight}}, A Surface RADAR {{Radar}}, A Torpedo Launcher {{TorpedoWeapon}} and a Skilled Lookout {{SurfaceShipPersonnel}} in the Reinforcement Expansion.

It derives its name from the Main ingredients: '''GU'''i'''T'''a'''RS'''olo, referencing the '''Gu'''n, '''T'''orp, '''R'''ADAR and Skilled Lookouts ('''S'''LO).

=Merits=

Guitarsolo allows the DD to get multiple rolls on Nightbattle CIs, improving the chances to roll one of them significantly. The CIs to be rolled are all single-hit attacks.
