==Introduction==
陸上航空基地に展開、対艦攻撃などを主任務とした陸上攻撃機です。<br>
大きな航続距離を持ち、対艦はもちろん対地攻撃も可能な本機は、中攻とも呼ばれ、<br>
初期の海軍基地航空戦力の基幹兵力を構成しました。本機の後継機が、あの有名な「一式陸攻」です。

Deployed at the Navy's land based airfields, its primary mission was anti-ship bombardment.
With it's long range, although it was naturally designed for anti-ship missions, it was used against land based installations as well.  It was also nicknamed the "Rikko." It formed the core of the Navy's early air power.  The successor to this design was the more famous "Type 1 Land Attacker."
