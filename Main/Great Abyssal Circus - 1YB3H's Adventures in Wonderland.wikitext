Most of the songs performed during the show are specificlly from Okoshi Kaori in general but along this additional music artist have been allowed to perform KanColle during the show.

The renowned Opera Singer Hirohisa Sannohe performed "Shizume" during the 3rd - 4th performance.

On the 10th - 12th, music artist Keizo Nakashini performed the Abyssal theme song "Shizume" during the half way point of the show.

'''Stage Performance'''

The stage performance was a mixture of some unique performances along with some story driven narrative performed by the [[Abyssal Chained Clown Demon]]. Which tells of a story how [[Michishio]], [[Shigure]], [[Yamashiro]] and up getting trapped in the Wonderland and how they ultimately escape it.

*During the beginning the [[Abyssal Chain Clown Demon]] emerged from the depths and introduced himself to the audience. He then explained that he would be telling everyone the story about what happened to some Kanmusu that got trapped in Wonderland.
*Story focuses on [[Michishio]], [[Shigure]], and [[Yamashiro]] getting lost in the  Wonderland during a sortie.
* One random Kanmusu (played bt a different seiyuu [see white rabbit roles for each day]) would end up becoming the White Rabbit for today's show. They would end up getting bunny ears.
* [[Michishio]] would begin to chase after the white rabbit, [[Shigure]] would follow behind, but [[Yamashiro]] would be slightly behind due to being slow.
* Most elements during the show would have an early circus vibe as there would be dancers with masks appearing off on the side if the stage performing during the sequences between the Kanmusu and the Abyssal Chain Clown Demon's narration.
* Music performance done by Music artist following this point
* Eventually  [[Michishio]], [[Shigure]], and [[Yamashiro]] would end up confronting some enemy abyssals (in inline skates) consisting of some [[PT Imp Group]]s, [[Light Cruiser Tsu-class]], and a [[Battleship Princess]].
* [[Michishio]] would discover a trumpet along the path, but sees it as unlucky and gives it to[[Shigure]] who does a trumpet performance during the show
* The call from the trumpet calls in Kanmusu reinforcement consisting of the Sendai-class, the Kongou-class, Destroyer Division 6, Kitakami and Ooi
* Admiral Mura would then appears on stage in inline skates.
* Suddenly the [[Night Strait Princesses]] appear on stage
* A major battle between the Kanmusu and the [[Night Strait Princesses]]
* Eventually one princess is defeated and only one remained and as the Kanmusus come in to deliver the finishing blow time stops...
* The White Rabbit is then seen as she located the clock (which resembles a Life Bouy) and retrieves it. Everything then goes black as we see a single light shine on the [[Abyssal Chain Clown Demon]] as he states that the past present and future are now united together as one let us end this wonderland.
* [[Michishio]], [[Shigure]], and [[Yamashiro]] wake up and find out they have come out from what was expected to be a dream as they realize they are no longer in wonderland. 
* End show 
* Closing song and surprise teasers are revealed (See next part for more details)

'''Noted Differences on August 10th's performance'''

* Shigure's reinforcements replaced the 6th Destroy Division in favor for [[Fusou]], [[Mogami]], [[Asagumo]] and [[Yamagumo]]
