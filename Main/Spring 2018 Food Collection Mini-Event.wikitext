==Tips==
* When using [[Battle Rations]] plan carefully what map you use them on. It's recommended to use them on maps where you're fleet will only travel 2 regular nodes before reaching the boss node. (I.E: 1-4, 2-2, 2-3, 2-5, 3-2, 4-2, 5-4 to name a few).
** Using them on maps with 3 nodes before the boss will risk having the ration be consumed
* Since rice is an item you are bound to collect in very large amounts, it's quite possible to reach 99 of them over the time of this mini event resulting in reaching it's hard cap. Thus making any rice you gather after that useless 
** Consider making some rice into '''Onigiri''' so that you don't waste any additional rice you gain while collecting food
* Always remember to cook all your food before the end of the mini-event as food will disappear once the event ends.
* '''Houshou's Meal Tickets''' will last for sometime before the expire following the event. So weigh your options before deciding on which meal ticket item you want to earn.
