==Gameplay Notes==
===Special Mechanics===
* Able to perform special AACI on Kai. Please see [[Anti-Air Cut-In]] for more details.
* She can trigger airstrike invulnerability when equipped with the [[12cm 30 Tube Rocket Launcher Kai 2]] at Kai. Please see equipment page for more details.
* She is capable of carrying seaplane bombers and fighters at Kai.
* She is capable of carrying carrier fighters, dive bombers and recons in her at Kai Ni.
**Please note that she still uses the regular surface ship shelling damage formula even when carrying dive bombers.
**Carrier based bombers and recons can not trigger artillery spotting
* At Kai Ni, main guns can only be equipped in the 1st and 2nd slot.
* She can perform OASW when equipped with two gyrocopters OR one helicopter

===Overview===
'''Kai'''
* Low firepower, HP and armour.
* Good plane count but bad slot distribution.

'''Kai Ni'''
* Average armour.
* Low firepower and HP.
* Great ASW.
* Great plane count and decent slot distribution. 
* Requires blueprint and prototype catapult.

'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''
* She has accuracy bonuses and penalties when equipped with certain large guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
'''Hyuuga Kai'''

Priority: '''High'''

:Upon remodel, she turns into an aviation battleship (BBV), which is to a standard battleship what a CAV is to a CA, and thus able to embark seaplane bombers and, much more importantly, fighters.
:This makes her obviously valuable to contest control of the air: however, her slot distribution makes her poorly suited for bombing.
:Just like aviation cruisers, she can attack enemy submarines with proper equipment, but she is generally a very poor choice for this role. 
:However, she has lower firepower than her "non-aviation" counterparts, and is in fact on the level of heavy cruisers.
:This is a very early, cheap remodel that becomes more important as soon as [[Akashi]] is added to the fleet if one wants to develop [[12cm 30 Tube Rocket Launcher Kai 2]]. 


'''Hyuuga Kai Ni'''

Priority: '''Very High''' if you do not have her sister's second remodel, otherwise '''High'''.

:This second remodel isn't good. It's ''very'' good.
:First, she is the only battleship in game besides [[Musashi]]'s second remodel to have five equipment slots, and you don't need me to tell you how useful that is, right?
:Second, she can trigger ''full immunity to airstrike damage'' with a very high chance by equipping the aforementioned rocket launcher, which is also pretty ridiculous.
:Third, she goes beyond seaplane and can now load fixed-wing fighters and dive bombers, essentially giving you a full carrier-battleship hybrid with incredible flexibility.
:Oh, and her plane slots are great, although not as good as her sister.
:The age of aviation is truly here.
:However, her Firepower is still below standard battleships, and keep in mind that this remodel requires 2 [[Blueprint]]s and a catapult.

:Note that, in a nod to the JMSDF ship, this remodel also comes with significant ASW abilities.
:However, that's essentially for amusement value and has no real use in game: just like in real life, capital ships should not play tag with submarines since much cheaper, smaller ships can do the job.


====Recommended Roles====
* Surface combat
* Air superiority
* Airstrike (Second remodel)
* Anti-air (Second remodel)

===Important Info===
* Required for quests A18, A60, A61, A77, B54, B102, B114, B132, C22, F86 and F87 
* She is an option for A43 and Bm4.

Ah yes, I became an aviation battleship together with Ise. That was because there was an incident involving my turret.<ref>In a maneuver on 5/5/1942, the 5th turret of Hyuuga exploded and required repairs. And at almost the same time (6/5~6/1942), the Imperial Japanese Navy was defeated in the Battle of Midway and lost 4 regular aircraft carriers. Under this situation, a flight deck was put on Hyuuga instead of being repaired to her original state in order to compensate for the loss of aviation force.</ref>
I intend to keep fighting at Kure until I'm reduced to dust.<ref>After she was damaged during the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Kure_(July_1945) Bombing of Kure], her crew ran her aground and she was used as a gun platform until the end of the war.</ref>
