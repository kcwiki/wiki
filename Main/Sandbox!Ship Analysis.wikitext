In addition to this she also gains a significant increase to her combat stats most notably her firepower which coupled with the Kagerou class fit bonuses make her the strongest double attack anti-installation destroyer. Overall she is slightly weaker than Kagerou and Shiranui in combined firepower + torpedo but makes up for this with her additional utility.

==[[Nagara]]==

==[[Isuzu]]==

Priority:

* Kai/Kai Ni: '''Low'''
: She is just an average light cruiser at Kai with no compensating features. Her Kai Ni doesn't improve her combat stats and actually reduces her combat effectiveness by taking away her ability to perform artillery spotting. She requires the least effort to obtain OASW but that is a minor benefit compared to focusing on more combat oriented light cruisers. Her ASW capability does become more valuable as you progress in the game so you can save your more valuable ASW ships for later event maps. Her AACI has an average fixed shootdown and multiplier. It also requires an inferior equipment loadout so it is best you do not use it.

Priority:

* Kai: '''Low'''
: She is just an average light cruiser at Kai with no compensating features.

* Kai Ni: '''Medium'''
: Her Kai Ni doesn't do much to improve her combat stats but she does gain a boost to her ASW and survivability. What she does gain is unparalleled versatility which is well worth the high remodel level and blueprint cost. She is certainly a "jack of all trades master of none". Her low overall stats means she loses out to more specialised light cruisers like [[Abukuma]] or [[Tama]] but her multi-role capability means she is still valuable in the long term. Critically, she is only the second CL capable of running opening torpedoes, allowing her to act as a substitute for when Abukuma needs to be saved.

Although she can carry both Daihatsu and Ka-Mi tanks, her low firepower means her effectiveness against installations is limited. It is also a waste of her capabilities. It does mean that she can be used to maximise expedition gains. Her AACI is, like like most other non-specialized AACIs, extremely mediocre. She is also one of the few ships where a Reinforcement Expansion is mandatory.

Although her Kai is nothing special in terms of combat stats, her opening torpedo ability is incredibly powerful. This becomes even more apparent when she hits Kai Ni. Her opening torpedo hits the damage cap and can take out most enemy ships that you'll encounter. Do note she is classified as a "Torpedo Cruiser" which means she doesn't count as a light cruiser and can encounter routing or fleet composition restrictions.

Do note she is classified as a "Torpedo Cruiser" which means she doesn't count as a light cruiser and can encounter routing or fleet composition restrictions.

* Kai Ni: '''Medium'''
: Her Kai Ni gives her a significant boost to her firepower that brings her closer to the other battleships. Though she is still on the low side compared to the other slow battleships. She does gain a huge improvement to her slot distribution since she now has a single large slot that allows her to carry seaplane bombers with a lot less risk that the slot will be emptied. The size of her bottom slot means that she'll also have decent airstrike power against soft targets. She does make a good stopgap aviation battleship until you get [[Ise]] to Kai Ni, which will take a while and cost a lot.

Priority:

* Kai/Kai Ni: '''Medium'''
: She is just an average light cruiser at Kai with no compensating features. Her Kai Ni gains better combat stats but she is still inferior to [[Kuma]], [[Nagara]] and [[Natori]]. Her saving grace is that her Kai Ni level is the lowest among all the light cruisers. But it is still quite high for her capabilities. She does have a slight niche in having a relatively high nominal ASW stat for her level, however, this comes at a time when a new player would be unlikely to be able to provide her the T4 sonars she needs to hit 100ASW.

==[[Mogami]]==

Priority:'''High'''

: Her firepower and torpedo stats are decent which makes her usable for combat. However, her defensive stats make her a lot more vulnerable than the other heavy cruisers of similar power. Her advantage is her very low remodel level and her ability to carry seaplane fighters. The latter is important when you need to bring air support to maps where carriers are restricted. This is especially important because the number of aviation cruisers in game is small. She is also fast, which means she isn't affected by speed restrictions either. As an added bonus, her large slot allows her to equip seaplane bombers with less risk that they will all be shot down.

Priority: '''Low'''

: She has low firepower for a light carrier which limits her damage potential. Her evenly distributed slots are not good but workable because they are all on the small side. This means her airstrike power isn't that good but it also means she can easily spread her damage more evenly against more targets. She'll work just fine for airstrikes against soft targets.

* Kai: '''Low'''
: She has low firepower and plane count combined with a terrible slot distribution. Her single large slot isn't enough to make up for the rest of her slots being very small. Being the 2nd slot, it also means she can lose the plane proficiency bonus or artillery spotting easily. Her slots don't allow her to do much than be a fighter mule.

* Kai Ni: '''Medium'''
: She gains a significant improvement to her firepower and plane count. Her slot distribution also improves a bit with the top slot increasing in size. It's still risky to bring her against heavy anti-air but her slots are usable now. Her slot setup allows her to bring both a decent airstrike and fighter power to sorties.

Priority:

* Kai: '''High'''
: She has low firepower and defensive stats for a battleship which makes her a poor choice for combat. Her low remodel level is a plus but it is tempered by her rarity. Her main use will be carrying seaplane fighters to contest air superiority in maps where carriers are restricted. While her AACI has a decent fixed shootdown and multiplier, it requires sacrificing too many equipment slots to be worthwile. The main reason why she is high priority is that she is required to upgrade the [[12cm 30-tube Rocket Launcher]] to [[12cm 30 Tube Rocket Launcher Kai 2]] with [[Akashi]].
* Kai Ni: '''Medium'''
: Her Kai Ni brings incredible flexibility with 5 slots and the ability to equip carrier fighters. She outperforms every other aviation ship when it comes to air support in maps where carriers are restricted. Do note that carrier-based recons and dive bombers are unable to trigger artillery spotting. Unfortunately, she doesn't get a significant upgrade combat-wise which leaves her lacking compared to other battleships. Her remodel also comes at a very steep cost since it requires Prototype Catapults.

: Her Kai has low firepower and defensive stats but she is still usable.
: Her Kai Ni improves her firepower and defensive stats. When taking into account her rarity, remodel level and remodel cost; she is a necessary fast battleship for every admiral. However, do note that her AACI has a low fixed shootdown and weak multiplier. It also has a high API number which means it will override nearly all other AACI in the fleet.

* Kai Ni C: '''Low'''
: She gains a bit of HP and a significant torpedo stat. She also loses a bit of armour. The torpedo stat puts her on par with the Yamato-class during night battles but due to being unable to equip 51cm guns, she falls slightly short. Her ability to carry seaplane bombers doesn't amount to much because of her small slot sizes. They are liable to get emptied. The steep cost of this remodel is another strike against it.

: Being obtainable from normal construction and having a low remodel level makes her a valuable part of the fleet.

Although she can carry seaplane fighters, she needs to compromise her combat ability to do so.
* Kai Ni: '''Medium-High'''
: Your first Kai Ni between [[Nagato]] and [[Mutsu]] should be a priority because of their powerful skill. Ideally Nagato herself due to quest prequisites. Aside from that, she gains a significant boost to her firepower and armour. Her ability to equip daihatsu also gives her potential in the anti-installation role. Though her performace against surface targets will suffer. Her blueprint requirement and high remodel level makes her take a back seat to other battleships if you already have Mutsu at Kai Ni.

==[[Akagi]]==

Priority: 

* Kai: '''Medium'''
: She will likely be the first carrier that you come across because she is a quest reward. Her important stats being slightly better than average means she will serve you well as an early carrier. Her good slot count is let down by her less than ideal slot distribution. The two medium slots being only 20 and positioned on top means she risks getting them emptied when facing heavy enemy anti-air. In that situation, she can lose her ability to perform artillery spotting and plane proficiency bonuses. 

* Kai Ni: '''Low'''
: She doesn't really improve much slot-wise at Kai Ni. However, she does gain a 5th slot that gives her incredible flexibility. She can easily find room for recon planes to help LoS or other utility equipment like radar for routing in events. She can also contribute a lot more fighter support than other carriers while still maintaining strike power. Her increase to firepower is also another welcome buff. However, her remodel is expensive and not worth the cost for most players. Her Kai Ni is strictly a late-game upgrade.

* Kai Ni E: '''Low'''
: Her top two slots actually get worse at Kai Ni E. The slots are quite small and will be prone to getting emptied by heavy enemy anti-air. She is a powerful night carrier that can hit the night battle cap with ease while still maintaining strike power during the day. That said, her niche role means it is better to keep her in her Kai Ni form unless you have the night planes required to make her useful.

* Kai Ni Go: '''Low'''
: Her slots get neutered and will be prone to getting emptied by heavy enemy anti-air. The ability to perform (O)ASW can be useful in some situations, but can impede her ability to conduct surface combat quite a bit since she prioritizes targeting submarines. Her Jet capabilities are nothing to write home about as she lacks the slot size to actually make them hit hard and survive reliably in heavy AA maps.

It also means she can help maximise expedition gains and be used at transport maps. As a bonus, she also gains minor buffs to her survivability.

==[[Tama]]==

Priority: '''Low'''
: She is essentially an average light cruiser until she gets her remodel. Despite her impressive-sounding versatility at Kai Ni, she is extremely expensive to obtain and in general outclassed by most other light cruisers at her price point. Unlike Yura, she misses out on opening torpedoes in exchange for more exotic niches like anti-installation and air support. Being able to equip both Daihatsu and tanks, gives her an edge over other anti installation ships due to the bonuses involved. Her ability to carry seaplane bombers isn't as useful because of her small slots, but her ability to carry seaplane fighters makes her a decent option for air support in maps where carriers are restricted. As CLs have the greatest differences between them in terms of ship capability, this makes Tama a relatively low priority.

==[[Kiso]]==

Priority: '''Medium'''

She is a decidedly average light cruiser at Kai. At Kai Ni, she gains the ability to perform opening torpedoes. Though her low torpedo compared to [[Kitakami]] or [[Ooi]] make her less than ideal option. She is still capable of taking out lighter enemies with her opening torpedo. Additionally, she only gains this ability at level 65, which is a much higher investment compared to her sisters. Do note she is classified as a "Torpedo Cruiser" which means she doesn't count as a light cruiser and can encounter routing or fleet composition restrictions.

===Recommended Roles===
* Combat

==[[Chitose]]==

* Seaplane Tender: '''High'''
: She is a very common seaplane tender. This is critical because she will be necessary for meeting routing requirements on certain maps. Other available seaplane tenders are either event, LSC or rare drops. Furthermore, she is fast which means she is unaffected by routing requirements. As for her combat ability, she has very low firepower which means she can't be counted on for shelling. The torpedo stat of her A remodel allows her to perform a respectable opening torpedo. Her plane count is on the low side but she has a large top slot. This allows her to bring along a seaplane bomber as long as you aren't facing heavy anti-air.

* Carrier: '''High'''
: The firepower of her carrier form is a bit on the low side. Her plane count does make up for it somewhat but her slot distribution lets her down. She gets a single large slot at the top that gives her good airstrike potential against a single target. The rest of her slots are quite small and risk being emptied when against heavy anti-air. Overall she is a decent shelling carrier.

Priority:

* Kai: '''Medium'''
: Her Kai suffers from a lack of firepower which means she is lackluster at shelling. Her good plane count is somewhat let down by the even slot distribution but that makes her flexible since she can increase or decrease the amount of fighters or bombers she takes without compromising too much. This does make her a bit of a jack of all trades, master of none. 

* Kai Ni: '''Low'''
: Her Kai Ni improves upon everything her Kai can do but at a steep cost. It does bring a significant increase to her firepower which increases her combat ability. Now, she can do powerful shelling attacks in addition to her airstrikes.

* Kai Ni A: '''High'''
: Her Kai Ni A increases her firepower further and provides a significant upgrade to her slot distribution. She now gets a large top slot and a respectable 2nd slot that makes her even better at being a shelling carrier. She does lose her flexibility with her plane loadouts but that doesn't matter much. In addition, she also gains the ability to shell while moderately damaged. All this makes this remodel well worth the expense.

Priority:

* Kai: '''Low'''
: She is just an average light cruiser at Kai with no compensating features.

* Kai Ni: '''Medium'''
: She has a costly Kai Ni with a high remodel level and requiring a blueprint. For that, she doesn't gain much in the way of combat stats. Her ability to carry both Daihatsu and Ka-Mi tanks don't count for much in the anti-installation role because of her poor firepower. Her best AACI does have an average fixed shootdown and multiplier but she lacks any other benefit to justify bringing her along over a dedicated AACI ship. Her primary asset is that expeditions she is on have an innate 5% resource bonus, as if she was already carrying a daihatsu. This in itself makes her the best expedition leader in the game. As an important thing to note, this "built in" daihatsu does not count for anti-installation purposes.

Priority:

* Kai: '''Low'''
: She is just an average light cruiser at Kai. Her remodel level is lower than other light cruisers but not by much.

* Kai Ni: '''Very High'''
: Her Kai Ni lowers her firepower a little bit but comes with a significant increase to her torpedo and armour. She also gains special abilities that make her one of the most important light cruisers in the game. The most important of these is the ability to equip midget submarines so she can perform opening torpedo strikes. For all intents and purposes, she is a torpedo cruiser in disguise, resulting in significantly increased passing rates in events. This alone already makes her a candidate for best CL in the game, and is a major asset in an event that needs to be committed carefully. Her ability to equip Daihatsu Landing Craft makes her an asset for maximising expedition gains and for transport maps. Although she can also equip Ka-Mi tanks, her low firepower and usefulness in other roles makes her unsuited to the task.

==[[Yuubari]]==

Priority: 

* Kai: '''Medium'''
: She is an average light cruiser in all aspects. Her special attribute is that she possesses 4 equipment slots. This gives her flexibility as a utility carrier. Her inability to do artillery spotting makes her a subpar choice for combat in all other cases. Her ASW might be low but her 4 slots allow her to hit OASW. Though this requires her to be near level 99 which takes some effort.

* Kai Ni: '''Low'''
:  In this remodel she has nothing to set herself apart from the other two alternatives. While she does possess the ability to equip large radars and an unique AACI it is not any stronger than generic AACIs any other ships can trigger, meaning that she doesn't have any real niche over other Anti-Air ships.

* Kai Ni Toku: '''Very High'''
: This form possesses the highest torpedo stat of her three Kai Nis and the ability equip daihatsu landing craft, type 2 tanks and midget submarines. While she also loses speed becoming slow, she mitigates this with the ability to become fast with the use of a single turbine. These abilities paired with her pseudo 5 slots and 30 base luck makes her one of the best CLs for Torpedo Cut-In setups as she can easily cap damage with her quest midget submarine while still bringing utility gear. She is also quite strong against installations due to the flexibility of her slots in spite of her low firepower.

* Kai Ni D: '''Low'''
: She possesses innate OASW which when paired with her 5 slots gives her a niche in pre-marriage OASW + installation and/or utility gear carrier. Outside of that she is outclassed by other light cruisers that outperform her in combat roles due to her relatively low firepower + torpedo stats.

==[[Zuihou]]==

* Kai: '''Low'''
: She has low firepower for a light carrier which limits her damage potential. Her evenly distributed slots are not very good because they are all on the small side. Her slot sizes are also mostly on the small side which limits her damage potential even further.

* Kai Ni: '''High'''
: She gains a significant increase in firepower and plane count that makes her work a lot better as a shelling carrier. Aside from the top slot, the rest of her slots remain on the small side which limits her airstrike potential. Being fast, it also means she isn't affected by speed restrictions.

* Kai Ni B: '''High'''
: She loses plane count in this remodel and her slot distribution becomes more even. This further limits her airstrike potential. It also means it's harder for her to be a shelling carrier since her slots are at risk of being emptied by heavy anti-air. She does gain the ability to perform OASW but her damage is limited by the inability to take advantage of synergy bonuses. The most significant change is her reclassification to "escort carrier" that means she can be included in a transport combined fleet. This allows her to bring significant air support in a fleet where you have limited options for the role.

Priority: '''High'''

: Her firepower and torpedo stats are decent which makes her usable for combat. However, her defensive stats make her a lot more vulnerable than the other heavy cruisers of similar power.

Her ability to equip 8cm guns in he reinforcement expansion also increases her flexibility by allowing her to continue to do night battle special attacks while maximising air power. Although her remodel level and cost is high, she is well worth the cost.

* Kai Ni Kou: '''Low'''
: Her Kai Ni Kou remodel turns her into a light carrier with great firepower, HP and armour. Her plane count is low and her slots are small but she makes an excellent shelling carrier.

The 5th slot allows her to carry a seaplane fighter to assist with air support without sacrificing her combat ability. Her AACI has a good fixed shootdown and decent multiplier. However, it requires a secondary gun to activate, which can interfere with her artillery spotting and night battle attacks. It is an option to use in combined fleets where her night battle performance is irrelevant. All this comes at a very high cost which can be better spent elsewhere for newer admirals.

: She has decent firepower but is let down somewhat by her slot distribution. Her slots being nearly evenly distributed makes her good for launching airstrikes since it spreads the damage around. Her large slot being on top reduces the chances of her losing out on plane proficiency bonuses. Additionally, her two medium slots being on the large side in their own right means she is less at risk of losing the ability to artillery spot. Her ability to shell at moderate damage is another bonus. However, she is only available from LSC which makes her expensive to obtain.

However, her low base ASW becomes an issue when trying to achieve OASW. She well require a lot of levels to be effective.

==[[Bismarck]]==

Priority: '''Low'''

: Both her Kai and Zwei have decent firepower and defensive stats for a fast battleship. She doesn't really bring anything else to the table other than that. Being an LSC-only ship and the added cost of a blueprint for her Zwei, it makes her not worth it.
: Her Drei gives her a torpedo stat that puts her on par with the Yamato-class for night battles but due to being unable to equip 51cm guns, she falls short. She also requires a second blueprint which is a steep cost for the minimal upgrade.

: She is the most important girl in your fleet because of her ability to upgrade equipment. It is the only way to access most event and ranking only equipment. Equipment upgrades are important to boost the effectiveness of your other girls. Her repair ability is a nice bonus that allows you to get more girls repaired while away for an extended period of time.

Priority: '''Very Low'''

* Taigei
: Her main use as Taigei is routing requirements in 6-1. In all other respects, she is a subpar ship. She can be used to contest air superiority where carriers are banned but any other aviation ship will be better than her.

* Ryuuhou
: Her firepower is bad and her plane counts to not help. In addition, she has a bad slot distribution with a single large slot and the rest of her slots being small. This limits her to taking only one bomber. Her one saving grace is that her large slot is on top which allows her to take advantage of the proficiency bonus easily. All that said, her remodel requires a blueprint which makes it very costly for the minimal benefits she brings.

==[[Asashimo]]==

Priority: '''Low'''
: She has average combat stats. The only thing that sets her apart from other destroyers is her very good ASW stat making her an acceptable option for early asw if you can find her. 
: Her Kai Ni remodel lowers her ASW in exchange for better combat stats and the ability to equip bulges and Ka-Mi tanks. She is still weaker than other combat destroyers while costing a blueprint and action report to remodel. Her ability to equip Ka-Mi tanks means she can perform adequately in an anti-installation role but she falls behind other destroyers that can equip both the tank and landing craft. Overall, she is an expensive remodel for not much additional benefit and should be held off till all other top tier and specialist destroyers leveled.

==[[Graf Zeppelin]]==

Priority: '''Low'''

: Although she has decent firepower, her slot distribution hurts her a lot. Since every other slot besides her top slot is small, she doesn't have a lot of striking power. It also means she can easily lose her ability to artillery spot. Her innate night attack is just a gimmick since it is a normal shelling attack that is based off her low firepower. Since she is also an event-only ship, her performance is not worth her rarity.

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Air Support
* Shelling Support

==[[Saratoga]]==

Priority: 

* Kai: '''Medium'''
: She has good firepower which makes her a good combatant. She is let down by her slot distribution. While she has a large top slot that makes for a powerful airstrike, her other slots being small means they risk being emptied. This can potentially disable her ability to artillery spot. 

* Mk.II: '''High'''
: Her Mk.II remodel is unique in that it does not require [[Night Operation Aviation Personnel]] to trigger night carrier cut-ins. This leaves more room for attack planes which gives her the most powerful night attack of the carriers. It also means she doesn't need to compromise her daytime combat ability.
: In addition to her special ability, her firepower and slot distribution is excellent. Her two large slots being on top means that she can more easily maintain her ability to artillery spot and the plane proficiency bonus. Her remodel does come at a steep cost but it is well worth it for her abilities.

* Mk.II mod.2: '''Medium'''
: She loses the innate ability to attack at night with her mod.2 remodel but gains the ability to shell while moderately damaged. She also loses a bit of firepower but gains plane count. Her slot distribution remains good and she is a good shelling carrier.

====Recommended Roles====

Priority: '''Low'''

: She has good firepower for a slow battleship but her defensive stats are lower than other slow battleships. Her AACI has a low fixed shootdown and multiplier.

==[[Iowa]]==

Priority: '''High'''

: She has very high firepower for a fast battleship and her high defensive stats make her even better. Her drawbacks are that she is an event-only drop and she is very costly to run. If you do have her, and resources are not an issue, she is a top pick for a fast battleship.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Support Expeditions

==[[Littorio]]==

Priority: '''Low'''

: She is a fast battleship with high firepower, which makes her a good choice for maps with speed restrictions.

==[[Aquila]]==

Priority: '''Low'''

: She has very low firepower, HP and armour. While her slot count is not the lowest, her slot distribution is very bad. Her top slot being so small means she risks losing the plane proficiency bonus and the ability to artillery spot. Her large slot is decent but not large enough to give her a good airstrike to make up for her shortcomings. Though she is cheap to run, she is event-only. So her performance is not worth her rarity.

==[[Akitsushima]]==

Priority: '''High'''

: Her main role is to allow slow fleets in 6-4 to take the shorter route. She can provide air support with seaplane fighters but her low defensive stats and slow speed means you should avoid using her where possible. The reason she is a high priority is the Type 2 Flying Boat she provides. It is a key piece of equipment for extending the range of your LBAS.

This allows her to provide air support in maps or quests where aviation cruisers are restricted. Do note that her long range can interfere with your shelling order, putting her at the same priority as battleships.

* Kai Ni: '''Low'''

==[[Commandant Teste]]==

Priority: '''Medium'''

: Her firepower and ability to artillery spot is enough to make her a decent daytime combatant. But she falls off in effectiveness at night because she lacks a torpedo stat.

==[[Gotland]]==

Priority: '''Low'''
: She functions similarly to [[Tama]] with less air support abilities. Although she lacks the installation prowess from landing craft and tanks; she makes up for it by having four slots that allows her to take two [[WG42]]. This somewhat makes up for her lack of Daihatsu and tank carrying ability. Like Tama, her ability to equip seaplane bombers isn't effective because of her small slot sizes.

* Kai
: She has a good torpedo stat that allows her to take out lighter ships with her opening torpedo. She also has good firepower for a seaplane tender that makes her a decent surface combatant. While she has a large slot, her slot distribution isn't ideal to utilize seaplane bombers because she needs to place one in a small slot to take advantage of proficiency bonuses. In addition, her ability to equip [[WG42]] and the [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank]] makes her a powerful anti installation ship.

* A
: She gains a significant upgrade to her torpedo and firepower that makes her an even better combat ship. Her biggest upgrade is gaining a 4th slot. This means that, prior to the introduction of [[Yahagi]] Kai Ni B & [[Mogami]] Kai Ni Toku, she was the only ship capable of running an artillery spotting setup with opening torpedoes. The 4th slot also increases her anti-installation ability significantly.

==[[Helena]]==

Priority: '''High'''

:A four slot light cruiser from Italy, similar to [[Ooyodo]], who brings lots of flexibility to the fleet.
:This turns her into an hard-hitting attacker against enemy installations when fitted with two [[WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)]].
:She has also a solid Firepower stat, making her a reliable daytime combatant with [[Artillery Spotting]].
:Furthermore, she has great HP and Armor stat for a CL, making her able to withstand more attacks than other ships of the same category.

====Recommended Roles====
* Surface combat
* Anti-installation

==[[Akishimo]]==

Priority: '''Low'''
: She is just an average destroyer at Kai that doesn't have anything to set her apart from the rest. She isn't useful for anything beyond quests. 

====Recommended Roles====
N/A

===Important Information===

==[[Usugumo]]==

Priority: '''Low'''

:At first remodel, she has low firepower and a decent torpedo stat, making her hitting harder in night battle than at day, but not great at either.
:While not impressive in combat, do keep in mind than many maps require you to bring at least a few destroyers for routing.
:Furthermore, destroyers are cheap to deploy and can equip [[Drum Canister]], making them suited for expeditions.

:No further remodels have been implemented for her yet (as of January 2020).

==[[Ariake]]==

Priority: '''Low-Medium'''

:At first remodel, she has low firepower and a decent torpedo stat, making her hitting harder in night battle than at day, but not great at either.
:While not impressive in combat, do keep in mind than many maps require you to bring at least a few destroyers for routing.

:Furthermore, destroyers are cheap to deploy and can equip [[Drum Canister]], making them suited for expeditions.
:She currently is the second lowest level DD capable of equipping Daihatsu-Class Landing Craft

====Recommended Roles====
* Expeditions

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Surface combat

==[[Jingei]]==

Priority: '''Very Low'''

: Her main use is routing requirements in 6-1. In all other respects, she is a subpar ship. She can be used to contest air superiority where carriers are banned but any other aviation ship will be better than her.

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Air Support
* Shelling Support
* Airstrike Support

==[[I-47]]==

Priority: '''Low'''

: She doesn't have any use outside of a few limited niches like cheesing 2-1 for quests, subtanking the 3-5 north route or 6-1 routing. 

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Combat

==[[Kaiboukan No.4]]==

Priority: '''Low'''

:Destroyer escorts, also known as ''kaiboukan'', are cheap, mass-produced vessels focused on ASW, and that's what they should be used for.
:With proper gear, they can perform OASW attacks from level 1 and consume very little fuel and ammo, giving an excellent bang for your bucks when it comes to dealing with subs.
:However, they are a poor fit for surface combat, so make sure not to expose them to enemy surface ships too much.

:Kaiboukan No.4 is weaker than other DEs due to being capped at 2 Equipment slots and generally lower statline. This makes her unable to make full use of ASW Synergy.
:They're also very cheap and easy to sparkle, and can therefore be used in expeditions that do not require a [[Drum Canister]] (as they cannot equip those).
:Furthermore, they can be used for an unique kind of [[Modernization]] that can increase HP, ASW and Luck. Refer to the corresponding page for details on that.
