===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''

: She has low firepower and plane count along with bad slot sizes. Having only 3 equipment slots is another mark against her. She is also slow which means she will have problems with speed restrictions. Although she is very common and cheap to run, her limited effectiveness in sorties means you're better off bringing any other carrier.

===Analysis===
* Kai: '''Low'''
: She has low firepower and plane count combined with a terrible slot distribution. Her single large slot isn't enough to make up for the rest of her slots being very small. Being the 2nd slot, it also means she can lose the plane proficiency bonus or artillery spotting easily. Her slots don't allow her to do much than be a fighter mule.

* Kai Ni: '''Medium'''
: She gains a significant improvement to her firepower and plane count. Her slot distribution also improves a bit with the top slot increasing in size. It's still risky to bring her against heavy anti-air but her slots are usable now. Her slot setup allows her to bring both a decent airstrike and fighter power to sorties.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Very Low'''

* Taigei
: Her main use as Taigei is routing requirements in 6-1. In all other respects, she is a subpar ship. She can be used to contest air superiority where carriers are banned but any other aviation ship will be better than her.

* Ryuuhou
: Her firepower is bad and her plane counts to not help. In addition, she has a bad slot distribution with a single large slot and the rest of her slots being small. This limits her to taking only one bomber. Her one saving grace is that her large slot is on top which allows her to take advantage of the proficiency bonus easily. All that said, her remodel requires a blueprint which makes it very costly for the minimal benefits she brings.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''

: She has low firepower for a light carrier which limits her damage potential. Her evenly distributed slots are not good but workable because they are all on the small side. This means her airstrike power isn't that good but it also means she can easily spread her damage more evenly against more targets. She'll work just fine for airstrikes against soft targets.

: She gains a significant increase in firepower that makes her much better at combat. Her slots also get redistributed into a much more effective layout. She gains two larger slots with the largest slot being her first slot. This makes her a great shelling CVL. Do keep in mind that she is slow so she'll have problems with speed restrictions.

===Analysis===
* Kai: '''Low'''
: She has low firepower for a light carrier which limits her damage potential. Her evenly distributed slots are not very good because they are all on the small side. Her slot sizes are also mostly on the small side which limits her damage potential even further.

* Kai Ni: '''High'''
: She gains a significant increase in firepower and plane count that makes her work a lot better as a shelling carrier. Aside from the top slot, the rest of her slots remain on the small side which limits her airstrike potential. Being fast, it also means she isn't affected by speed restrictions.

* Kai Ni B: '''High'''
: She loses plane count in this remodel and her slot distribution becomes more even. This further limits her airstrike potential. It also means it's harder for her to be a shelling carrier since her slots are at risk of being emptied by heavy anti-air. She does gain the ability to perform OASW but her damage is limited by the inability to take advantage of synergy bonuses. The most significant change is her reclassification to "escort carrier" that means she can be included in a transport combined fleet. This allows her to bring significant air support in a fleet where you have limited options for the role.

===Analysis===
* Seaplane Tender: '''High'''
: She is a very common seaplane tender. This is critical because she will be necessary for meeting routing requirements on certain maps. Other available seaplane tenders are either event, LSC or rare drops. Furthermore, she is fast which means she is unaffected by routing requirements. As for her combat ability, she has very low firepower which means she can't be counted on for shelling. The torpedo stat of her A remodel allows her to perform a respectable opening torpedo. Her plane count is on the low side but she has a large top slot. This allows her to bring along a seaplane bomber as long as you aren't facing heavy anti-air.

* Carrier: '''High'''
: The firepower of her carrier form is a bit on the low side. Her plane count does make up for it somewhat but her slot distribution lets her down. She gets a single large slot at the top that gives her good airstrike potential against a single target. The rest of her slots are quite small and risk being emptied when against heavy anti-air. Overall she is a decent shelling carrier.

===Analysis===
Priority: 

* Kai: '''Medium'''
: She has low firepower and small slots for a CVL. Her main strength is her medium range at Kai Ni and the ability to perform OASW. She achieves this at a low remodel level compared to the other escort carriers. She is let down by her small slot size and she will face difficulties performing her intended role when up against enemy airpower. While she can equip ASW equipment to take advantage of synergy, she loses effectiveness as a carrier.

* Kai Ni: '''Low'''
: She doesn't gain anything with her Kai Ni remodel that justifies the expense. She can perform adequately in her role at Kai.
