==Introduction==
パスタの国で運用された信頼性と運動性に優れた複葉複座の水偵Ro.43を単座に改修した水上戦闘機です。<br>
低速なため戦闘機としては限界がありますが、貴重な洋上防空戦力として期待されました。<br>
量産数は控えめです。

''A single-seat seaplane fighter remodeled from the double-seat [[Ro.43 Recon Seaplane]] that came from the country of pasta.''<br>
''Because it was not as speedy, it has a limited capability as a fighter, but was counted on as a valuable maritime anti-air force.''<br>
''It was not mass produced as much.''

==Notes==
*'''Cannot be used to activate [[Artillery Spotting|daytime special attacks]]''' by itself as it no longer has recon function.
