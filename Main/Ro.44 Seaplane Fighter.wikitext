==Introduction==
パスタの国で運用された信頼性と運動性に優れた複葉複座の水偵Ro.43を単座に改修した水上戦闘機です。<br>
低速なため戦闘機としては限界がありますが、貴重な洋上防空戦力として期待されました。<br>
量産数は控えめです。

A Single-Seated Seaplane fighter remodeled from the doubled seated Ro.43 Seaplane that came from the Country of Pasta. <br>
Because it was not as speedy, it has a limited capability as a fighter, but was counted on as a valuable maritime anti-air force.<br>
It was not mass produced as much.

==Notes==
*January 2016 Rank Reward Item
*Can be obtained via upgrading [[Ro.43 Recon Seaplane]].
*Default Equipment of [[Pola|Pola Kai]] and [[Zara|Zara Due]].
*'''Cannot be used to activate [[Artillery Spotting|daytime special attacks]]''' by itself as it no longer has recon function.
