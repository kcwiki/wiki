==Introduction==
パスタの国で運用された信頼性と運動性に優れた複葉複座の水偵Ro.43を単座に改修した水上戦闘機です。<br>
低速なため戦闘機としては限界がありますが、貴重な洋上防空戦力として期待されました。<br>
量産数は控えめです。

''A Single-Seated Seaplane fighter remodeled from the doubled seated Ro.43 Seaplane that came from the Country of Pasta.''<br>
''Because it was not as speedy, it has a limited capability as a fighter, but was counted on as a valuable maritime anti-air force.''<br>
''It was not mass produced as much.''
