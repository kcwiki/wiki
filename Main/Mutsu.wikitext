===Special Mechanics===
* She can carry seaplane fighters on kai.
* She gains the ability to equip WG42 and tanks on Kai Ni.
* She gains a special attack on Kai Ni called "'''Nagato, Ready? Let's do this! Main guns, full broadside!'''" (長門、いい？ いくわよ！ 主砲一斉射ッ！) that targets 3 enemies at random.
** Activation requirements are as follows:  
*** Mutsu Kai Ni must be the flagship.
*** Another battleship must be in the 2nd position.
*** She must not be more than <span style="color:gold;">'''lightly damaged (小破)'''</span>.
*** The rest of the fleet must not contain a submarine.
*** '''Echelon formation''' needs to be selected in a single fleet OR '''Cruising Formation 2''' for a combined fleet.
** If triggered, Mutsu will do two attacks with a 1.4x post-cap modifier and the other battleship will do a 3rd attack with a 1.2x post-cap modifier.
*** If [[Nagato|Nagato Kai]] is the 2nd ship, Mutsu gains a 1.61x post-cap modifier while Nagato gains a 1.62x post-cap modifier.
*** If [[Nagato|Nagato Kai Ni]] is the 2nd ship, both Mutsu and Nagato will gain a 1.68x post-cap modifier.
*** If [[Nelson]] is the 2nd ship, Mutsu will gain a 1.54x post-cap modifier while Nelson gains a 1.5x post-cap modifier.
*** An AP shell will provide an extra 1.35x multiplicative bonus.
*** A radar with 5 or more LoS stat will provide an extra 1.15x multiplicative bonus.
*** See below for calculated bonus:

** It can be triggered even if you fail to activate artillery spotting.
** It can only be activated '''once per sortie'''.
** It has a chance to trigger every time she takes a turn at shelling. If it fails to trigger in day, there is a chance to trigger it in the followup night battle.
** The attack will consume extra ammo from both participating battleships when triggered. The total ammo consumption will be x1.5 of the original ammo consumption of when the attack is triggered ([https://twitter.com/syoukuretin/status/1063895644790677504 Source]), hence:

**If it is triggered in day battle, it costs 10% extra ammo.
**If it is triggered in an night battle node, it costs 5% extra ammo.
**If it is triggered in a night battle in a normal node, it costs 15% extra ammo.

===Overview===
'''Kai'''
* Good firepower, HP and armour.

'''Kai Ni'''
* Great firepower and armour.
* Good HP.
* Requires blueprint.

===Fit Bonuses===
{{:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Equipment Bonuses}}
{{clear}}

'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''
* She has accuracy bonuses and penalties when equipped with certain large guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority: 

* Kai: '''High'''
: Being obtainable from normal construction and having a low remodel level makes her a valuable part of the fleet. Her high firepower, armour and HP will make her a mainstay until you obtain the LSC or event-only battleships. Although she can carry seaplane fighters, she needs to compromise her combat ability to do so.
* Kai Ni: '''Medium-High'''
: Your first Kai Ni between [[Mutsu]] and [[Nagato]] should be a priority because of their powerful skill. Aside from that, she gains a significant boost to her firepower and armour. Her ability to equip WG42 and tanks also gives her potential in the anti-installation role. Though her performace against surface targets will suffer. Her blueprint requirement and high remodel level makes her take a back seat to other battleships if you already have Nagato at Kai Ni.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Anti-Installation - Kai Ni
* Support Expeditions

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Air Support

===Important Info===
* Required for quests A42, A75, A92, B22, B24, B31, B99, B129, and B130. 
* An option for A43 and Bm4.
* Excellent source of [[41cm Twin Gun Mount]].

==Trivia==
*She is named after [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutsu_Province Mustu Province], made out of modern day [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Prefecture Fukushima], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyagi_Prefecture Miyagi], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iwate_Prefecture Iwate], and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aomori_Prefecture Aomori] Prefectures.
*Her lines about playing with fire are all double entendres about flirting with her.
*She formerly had the lowest luck among all ships (before Taihou was added) as she sank without experiencing real battles, due to an explosion of her 3rd turret in the summer of 1943.
*She is compared to a snail and slug due to her horn-like headgear. Nagato's headgear is similar but more back-swept, probably sparing her from similar nicknames.
*She sunk due to an internal explosion on 8 June 1943. Most of the wreckage was later salvaged between the mid-50's to 1970's.
