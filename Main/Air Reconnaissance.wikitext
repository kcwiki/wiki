Air Reconnaissance allows your ships to gather additional resources from specific nodes marked with green lines marked with an X, provided your fleet is equipped with recon planes. 
*An animation will be shown with your recon planes flying to the node. If both Type 2 Flying Boat and other seaplanes are brought, Type 2 Flying Boat animation takes priority.
*Successful reconnaissance will reward additional resources upon winning with a B rank or higher at the boss node. If your fleet does not go to the boss node, reconnaissance rewards are forfeit.
*Success and critical success rates are dependent on which ships and what equipments are equipped. 
**AVs have the highest success rates
**Type 2 Flying Boat has the highest success rates
**Akitsushima with a Type 2 Flying Boat appears to have the best rates
