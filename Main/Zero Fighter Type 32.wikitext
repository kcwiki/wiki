==Introduction==

名機零式艦戦21型の性能向上型、「零式艦上戦闘機32型」です。
翼端を角型に変更、エンジン換装により出力向上を図りました。
また、搭載機銃の弾数も増やしています。
航続距離など不利な点もありましたが、ラバウル航空隊やブイン、そしてソロモン上空の戦いに参加しました。

An improvement over the high performance Model 21 Zero, the "Model 32 Zero".
The wing tips were squared off and the engine retrofitted to improve performance.
In addition to that, the ammunition capacity of the machine guns was increased.
It was at a disadvantage when it came to operation range but it still served in the Rabaul and Buin Air Corps as well as in the skies of Solomon.
