==Trivia==
*She is named after [[wikipedia:Kaga_Province|Kaga Province]], modern day [[wikipedia:Ishikawa_Prefecture|Ishikawa Prefecture]].
*Scuttled after being heavily damaged by a US air attack at the [[wikipedia:Battle_of_Midway|Battle of Midway]], 4 June 1942
*Wreckage possibly found in late 1999. Sadly, no further expeditions have been made.
*Originally designed as a [[wikipedia:Tosa-class_battleship|''Tosa''-class Battleship]], she was converted into a carrier after the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty in 1921.
*In the 4koma, she is often portrayed as irrationally protective of Akagi from the destroyers that historically scuttled her (who were also their escorts).  Historically, all four CarDiv1 and CarDiv2 carriers ([[Akagi]], [[Hiryuu]], [[Souryuu]] and herself) were scuttled in the Battle of Midway by Japanese destroyers' torpedoes after being heavily damaged by air attacks. During WW2, scuttling (intentional allied sinking to prevent capture) was very common, and the IJN rarely took prisoners or allowed themselves to be POWs.
*In the 4koma, she gives off excessive levels of body heat, which she can be very sensitive about. This is a reflection of one of the historic Kaga's exhaust layouts overheating the flight deck and causing the rear crew quarters to be near uninhabitable.
**Beginning in the 1910s, nations all over the world experimented with ship designs & layouts culminating in the ''aircraft carrier''. Issues such as exhaust layout, aircraft elevators, command bridges, ship weaponry, and so forth vastly differed between classes and even within classes.
