Click on a quest to get the orange icon on the right to light up. This means you've activated the quest and it will track your progress until you complete it.

Clicking on the quest again will deactivate it. The quest will stop tracking you for the objective, but it will save its progress until you activate it again. This is important because ''you can only have 5 quests activated at any time''.

Completion of quests [[#D18|D18]], [[#B134|B134]] and [[#B159|B159]] will award a Headquarters Personnel each, which upon use allows you to have 1 additional quest activated at the same time. You can redeem the Headquarters Personnel in your Inventory. This will allow you to extend the maximum of activated quests up to '''eight'''.

When you complete the quest, the icon on the right will turn blue. Click on it to claim your rewards.

Note that expedition quests are evaluated upon successful completion of each expedition, so these quests must be active when your expeditions return. Crafting and repair quests are evaluated immediately, so there's no point in leaving these quests active when the timer is already counting down.

Daily quests are reset every day at 05:00 JST (GMT +9). Weekly quests are reset every Monday at 05:00 JST. Monthly quests are reset the first day of each month at 05:00 JST. Daily, weekly and monthly quests are deactivated upon reset.

''Specific ships are required for certain quests. A list of these ships and quest spreadsheets can be found '''[[List_of_ships_required_by_quests|here]]''' or in the '''[[#See also|See also]]''' section.''

=== Monthly Quests ===

**This obviously does not work if the start of the new month is a Monday, as weekly quests also reset at the same time.

== Factory Quests ==
*Note: Quests requiring you to scrap equipment count the number of times the scrap button is pressed, '''NOT''' the number of equipment scrapped. Bulk-scrapping equipments only increases the counter by 1. Keep this in mind while undertaking scrapping quests.
**This applies mainly to early scrapping quests such as [[#F12|F12]] and others.
**This requirement was reworked in later quests. Exceptions to this rule include [[#F34|F34]], [[#F65|F65]], [[#F66|F66]], [[#F68|F68]], and [[#F69|F69]], as well as most quarterly quests, which '''do''' count the number of equipment scrapped even when bulk-scrapping is used.

*[[#F13|F13]], [[#F14|F14]], and [[#F15|F15]] have special rules: If any of the following actions is taken after you scrapped the appropriate equipment but before you go into the quest window, the game will not give you credit for the progress:
:#You changed the flagship; or
:#You unequipped the "base equipment" off the flagship.
:*In addition, if the "base equipment" is locked, you can get credit for the quest, but the game will not let you click on the quest to gain the reward. You would need to remove the equipment to unlock it, and you can still keep the quest progress if you don't return to the naval base screen after unlocking and re-equipping. Returning to naval base screen after un-equip -> unlock -> re-equip will reset the quest progress.
