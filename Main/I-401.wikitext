==Gameplay Notes==
===Special Mechanics===
* Able to perform opening torpedo attacks when equipped with a [[Type A Ko-hyoteki]].
** Able to perform opening torpedo attacks by default at level 10.
* Able to carry seaplane fighters and bombers.

===Overview===
* Good torpedo, HP and armour.

===Fit Bonuses===
{{:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Equipment Bonuses}}

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''

: She doesn't have any use outside of a few limited niches like cheesing 2-1 for quests, subtanking the 3-5 north route or 6-1 routing. Outside of those limited uses, her good defensive stats and large slots for a submarine make her a good candidate when you require a submarine that can provide air support.

====Recommended Roles====
* Air Support

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Combat
