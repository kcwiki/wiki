==Gameplay Notes==
===Special Mechanics===
* She has the ability to repair other ships in the fleet. This is known as '''[[Repairs#Anchorage Repairs|Anchorage Repairs]]'''.
** She must be the flagship.
*** She does not have to be in fleet 1
** Akashi or the ships being repaired  must not be more than <span style="color:gold;">'''lightly damaged (小破)'''</span>. 
** Akashi or the ships being repaired must not be in the docks.
** The ability works as follows:
*** Once '''20 minutes''' have elapsed, returning to the home screen after that time will reset the timer and repair all eligible ships.
**** Changing out ships or shifting them around will '''reset the 20 minute timer''' without repairing.
**** If the amount of HP recovery would be less than 1 after 20 minutes, it will be rounded up. This means ships that take more than 20 minutes to recover 1hp can be repaired faster by Akashi if you keep checking in every 20 minutes.
**** Amount of HP recovered is calculated individually for each target.
*** By default, she can only repair herself and the ship in the 2nd slot. Every [[Ship Repair Facility]] equipped will increase the amount of repairable ships by 1.
*** Please see [[Docking]] for more details about repair time and cost.
**** Unlike the listed repair time formula, Akashi's repair just has the seconds rounded up instead of having 30 seconds added.
*** The repair cost is automatically deducted based on how much HP has been repaired on update.
*** Repair works even if she isn't in the 1st fleet.
*** If you do not have sufficient resources, the repair will not work.
* She has the ability to repair fleets mid-sortie. This is known as '''[[Repairs#Emergency Anchorage Repairs|Emergency Anchorage Repairs]]'''.
** Requires [[Emergency Repair Materials]] equipped to perform. These can go in a [[Reinforcement Expansion]].
*** Only one is consumed no matter how many ships are repaired.
** She must not be <span style="color:orange;">'''moderately damaged (中破)'''</span> or worse.
** The amount of ships in a [[Combined Fleet]] that are repaired depends on the number of [[Ship Repair Facilities]] equipped.
*** 1: Slots 1-3 of the main fleet.
*** 2: Slots 1-6 of the main fleet.
*** 3: Slots 1-6 of the main fleet and 1-3 of the escort fleet.
*** 4. All ships in the combined fleet.
** Increases the morale of repaired ships by <span style="color:green;">'''+7'''</span>.
** Repairs 30% of '''Max HP''' rounded up.
** Does not work on <span style="color:red;">'''heavily damaged (大破)'''</span> ships.
* She has the ability to upgrade equipment. Please see [[Improvement]] for more details.

===Overview===
Her stats are irrelevant to her main role.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Very High'''

: She is the most important girl in your fleet because of her ability to upgrade equipment. It is the only way to access most event and ranking only equipment. Equipment upgrades are important to boost the effectiveness of your other girls. Her repair ability is a nice bonus that allows you to get more girls repaired while away for an extended period of time. It is imperative that you get her to Kai as soon as possible for the boost in success rates.

===Important Info===
* Required for quest A45.
* Required for all equipment upgrade quests.

|translation = I'm Akashi, the only repair ship in the Combined Fleet. I was in charge of repairing ships damaged in the front lines when I was stationed in the Truk Anchorage.<ref>During the war Akashi operated out of the Japanese base in the Truk atoll where she repaired various types of battle-damaged Japanese warships, including the Shōkaku in October 1942 and the Yamato in December 1943.</ref> I supported the fleet from behind right up until the destruction of the Anchorage.<ref>In February 1944 the Americans made a raid on Truk (Operation Hailstone), sinking and damaging many ships. Akashi was damaged in these attacks and escaped to the Japanese atoll of Palau. On 30 March 1944, while anchored off Urukthapel in the Palau islands, Akashi was hit numerous times by bombs and rockets from American aircraft from Task Group 58, during Operation Desecrate One. She was sunk in shallow water with her bridge and cranes still remaining above the water.</ref> Pleased to meet you.

==Trivia==
* She was first in game as the Item Shop NPC [[NPC|Premium shop and LSC ship]].
* She is named after [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashi,_Hy%C5%8Dgo Akashi City]. 
**She is the 2nd ship to bear the name.
*The only specialized repair ship operated by the IJN (the other two were cancelled).
*Escaped [[wikipedia:Operation_Hailstone|Operation Hailstone]] on Truk in February 20, 1944, fleeing to Palau.
*Sunk while anchored in Palau on March 30, 1944 during [[wikipedia:Operation_Desecrate_One|Operation Desecrate One]].
*Salvaged and scrapped in 1954.
*Akashi had 17 different factories within her body. Factories included furnace and anvils amongst other things - a mobile manufacturing complex.
*Out of the 779 crew in her, 443 were mechanics, which was not limited to military personnel.
*Had 2 chimneys. The front chimney was used to exhale smoke from the factories - the one you see around her right arm.
*Had power generation capabilities that rivalled the [[Yamato]] (4800kw) in order to power her machines.
*Had German machinery loaded, allowing her to have unparalleled reparation abilities compared to standard onshore factories. Her ability to repair ships efficiently was what made her a priority target by the Americans.
