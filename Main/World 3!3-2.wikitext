===Tips===
*All destroyers should be remodeled, equipped with double attack setup and have their stats maxed (with the exception of AA).
*Use Line ahead in boss node.
<br/>'''Standard Compositions'''
*Each fleet composition below has a chance of avoiding Node H if specific conditions are met:
**'''6 DD''' has a '''50% chance''' of avoiding '''Node H'''
**'''1 CL 5 DD''' have a '''30% chance''' of avoiding '''Node H'''
<br/>'''Speed Enhanced Compositions'''
*By using equipment such as turbines and boilers, you can also avoid '''Node G and H''' (See [[Improving Ship Speed]] for additional details on how to improve your ships speed performance when considering the below options)
** '''Fast+''' fleet that consists of '''1CL 5DD''' and is equipped with 1 Radar '''will always bypass node H'''
** Using a Fleet of ships that can go '''Fastest''' will give them a 50% chance of avoiding going to '''Node G''' and instead take '''Node E'''
*** Ships such as [[Shimakaze]] and [[Tashkent]] can easily reach fastest without lots of boilers, however all other DD will need 2 of New High Pressure, High Speed Boilers to achieve Fastest which can only be achieved through [[Amatsukaze]] or expensive engine improvements.
**A Fast Fleet consisting of '''1 AO, 1 XX, 4 DD''' has a '''40% chance''' of avoiding '''node H''' and 40% chance of going to '''Node E'''

<br/>'''Ammo Farming : 1 XX (as long as ship is not a (F)BB(V) or CV(L)(B)'''
*This map makes it possible to farm ammo which you can earn anywhere between '''50-155 ammo'''. The process to gaining ammo is simple and it is recommended to use a '''throwaway ship''' to save on spending resources while completing the take.
*The following steps must be taken to ensure this can be completed:
** Equip throwaway ship with [[Repair Team]]
** Send this to Node A and lose the battle
** Select to use repair team onward.
** Reach Node B and get ammo
*'''NOTE:''' The [[Repair Team]] '''is not consumed''' while doing this process as this is the only battle you go through and your repair team is only consumed if you enter a 2nd fight. Since there is no 2nd fight, the repair team remains equipped on your throwaway ship.
*Once complete, remove [[Repair Team]] from said ship and rinse and repeat as you gain ammo at an alarming rate.
*'''Additional Note:''' '''This process will cause your Sortie Win/Lose Ratio to drop''' over time if you do not have a large sortie participation number. Please carefully consider doing this practice if you are relatively new as it could risk your chance in participating in  [[Events]] if your sortie % rate drops to below 75%.
