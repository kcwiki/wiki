===Analysis===
Priority: '''High'''
:She has decent Firepower and an impressive Torpedo stats, making her excellently suited for surface combat after a single remodel.
:While her night battle potential is very high, her 12 base luck is low and doesn't allow her to use night cut-in attacks reliably. 
:Still, it's the highest among her sisters and could sort of work in a pinch. (Raising her Luck stat is an option for veteran admirals.)

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat

===Important Info===
* Required for quests A54, A55, B46, B47, and F36.

==Trivia==
*Her name means "island wind."
*She was a unique ship with no sister ships.  In media, she is often shown as depressed by this.
**However, [[Amatsukaze]] used prototype steam boilers and turbines which were later used in Shimakaze's construction.
*Sunk in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ormoc_Bay Battle of Ormoc Bay] near [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cebu,_Philippines Cebu, Philippines], 11 November 1944.
*She was not actually the world's fastest destroyer at the time; that honor goes to the French destroyer ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_destroyer_Terrible Terrible]''. ''Terrible'' had a top speed of 45 knots as opposed to Shimakaze's 40.9 knots. However if one considers offshore speed, Shimakaze would be the fastest destroyer at that time.
*Fans have given her the nickname "Zekamashi", her name "spelled" backwards as it would be on an old Japanese life preserver. This is because traditionally, Japanese was written in vertical columns from right to left. If you tried to write on something thin like a life preserver, there would only be space for one character per line, so you would end up writing backwards by modern, left-to-right standards.
*The Shimakaze in game is the second ship in the Japanese Navy to bear the name. Her predecessor being a Minekaze-class Destroyer who was slightly slower at 40.65 knots during sea trials.

===Behind the Design=== 
[[File:PrototypeFubuki.png|right]]
Back in June 2016's Comtiq Magazine, an interview was conducted with Kantai Collection's producer Kensuke Tanaka, and artist Shizuma Yoshinori where they discussed about the work they did together back while producing the game.It was revealed through thier interview that Yoshinori orginally created Shimakaze's design for the [[Fubuki|Fubuki-class]]. But as revealed the design looked too fast to fit the Fubuki-class so Takana suggested that Yoshinori use this design and re-do it for Shimakaze. 

As an end result the design that orginally started off as the Fubuki-classes design would then become changed into the Shimakaze we now know today.

===Historical Note===
Shimakaze was planned and built as the experimental prototype of a new class of heavy destroyers, designated "Type C" (丙型駆逐艦). Sixteen other units were ordered but later cancelled due to more pressing wartime needs. Though never repeated, she was a successful design, combining large size (some 25 feet longer than yuugumo-class), firepower (six 5" guns in new Type D turrets), and heavy torpedo armament (three quintuple sets of 24" tubes, the most powerful such broadside ever mounted on a Japanese destroyer) with a 40-knot top speed. The latter was thanks to new high-pressure, high-temperature boilers able to generate nearly 80,000 shaft horsepower and would have propelled all future Japanese destroyer designs, had circumstances permitted their construction.
