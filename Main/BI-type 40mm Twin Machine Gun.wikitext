==Introduction==
英国ヴィッカース社より導入した対空機銃です。<br>射撃時の音からポンポン砲とも呼ばれ、国内でライセンス生産もされました。徐々に後発の国産対空機銃に更新されていきました。

''This is an anti-aircraft autocannon introduced by the British Vickers Ltd. company. <br>Also known as the "pom-pom" gun due to its firing sound and it's two round burst, it was licensed but also produced domestically. It was gradually replaced by more modern anti-aircraft guns.''

==Notes==
