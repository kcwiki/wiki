==Introduction==
水雷戦隊旗艦用に開発された水上夜間偵察機です。<br>長時間の滞空性能を持つ黒く塗装された機体に、夜間索敵能力に優れた搭乗員が乗りこみます(条件が整えば夜戦を支援する「夜間触接」が発生する可能性があります)。

''This night recon seaplane was developed for use of DesRon flagships. The airframe is painted black, has an excellent loiter time and included within the crew is a skilled spotter trained in night operations aboard. (It can also spot for allied ships during night time reconnaissance.)''

==Notes==
[[File:Recon2.jpg|thumb|115x115px|(Picture credits to DarkSeikan)]]
Has the ability to trigger [[Night Battle#Night Contact|Night Contact]].

The scouting phase animation will not show up like day battle's; instead, you will see the '''night recon plane's animation in the enemy fleet's radar''' (as seen in this picture,''' top right''') 

Acts as a artillery spotter too in day battle but has smaller activation rates due to its lower {{LOS}} stat.

(Bug) In a [[Combined Fleet]] situation, if a ship in the fleet armed with the night scout is removed from the combined fleet using the [[Fleet Command Facility]], the night scout can still trigger and activate as your fleet proceeds onward and enters a night battle.
