==Introduction==
水雷戦隊旗艦用に開発された水上夜間偵察機です。<br>長時間の滞空性能を持つ黒く塗装された機体に、夜間索敵能力に優れた搭乗員が乗りこみます(条件が整えば夜戦を支援する「夜間触接」が発生する可能性があります)。

''This night recon seaplane was developed for use of DesRon flagships. The airframe is painted black, has an excellent loiter time and included within the crew is a skilled spotter trained in night operations aboard. (It can also spot for allied ships during night time reconnaissance.)''
==Notes==
'''Unbuildable.''' Stock equipment of [[Sendai|Sendai Kai Ni]].

Can provide the following effects when a ship equipped with this enters a night battle:
*Increases the critical hit rate of the whole fleet during night battle.
This effect is applied only if scouting phase during night battle is successful.

The scouting phase animation will not show up like day battle's; instead, you will see the '''night recon plane's animation in the enemy fleet's radar''' (as seen in this picture,''' top right''')

Acts as a artillery spotter too in day battle but has smaller effect.

(Bug) In a [[Combined Fleet]] situation, if a ship in the fleet armed with the night scout is removed from the combined fleet using the [[Fleet Command Facility]] the night scout can still trigger and activate as your fleet proceed onward and enters a night battle.
