=Introduction=

In certain maps, you are able to access support expeditions to help you during battles. These expeditions are deployed like normal resource expeditions and have a chance of appearing at certain nodes and at the boss.  

Currently these are only available in World 5 and events.

=Overview=
[[File:Support_Expedition.png|thumb|right|A shelling Support Expedition appears in a night battle node]]
1. Areas which have support expeditions available for use have support expeditions listed under the expedition tab for the corresponding area. For a list of support expeditions, please [[Support_Expedition#Expedition_List|see below]].

2. The type of support fleet that appears depends on the composition of the fleet. Please see the [[Support_Expedition#Support_Types|various support types]] for more details.

3. The sortie fleet must encounter an eligible node '''before the support expedition timer runs out''' in order for support to appear. 
* If the timer runs out, support fleets will not appear.

4. Shelling and torpedo support can '''appear in night or day nodes''' but airstrike and ASW support can '''only appear in day nodes'''.
* No support will appear in air raids, air battle or RADAR ambush nodes.

5. The support fleet will appear after the [[Aerial Combat]] phase during day battles. 
* The exception are night-day nodes where airstrike/ASW support arrives after [[LBAS]] but before [[Aerial Combat]].

6. The damage cap for support is '''150''' for all cases.
* This means that even if support shows up in night battle, it does not get advantage of the 300 damage cap.
* The cap during '''head-on engagement''' is 187.

7. Only '''visible stats''' are taken into account.
* This means any hidden modifiers from upgrades or gun fit are ignored.

8. When the sortie fleet returns, the support fleets will return as well.
* They will return regardless of if they have performed any support attacks.
* You do not have to wait for the timer to expire like normal expeditions.

9. Support expeditions will always require resupplying '''regardless of if they have performed a support attack'''.

10. Instead of the normal 3 morale reduction for normal expeditions, the cost for support expeditions vary.
* Node support: 1-5
* Boss support: 1-10

11. The resource cost is '''rounded up''' instead of down.

===Trigger Rate===

The trigger rate differs between node support and boss support.


<math>\text{Node %} = 50 + \text{Mod}_\text{flag} + 5 \times \text{Mod}_\text{consort} + 1</math>


<math>\text{Boss %} = 85 + \text{Mod}_\text{flag} + 5 \times \text{Mod}_\text{consort} + 1</math>


* <math>\text{Mod}_\text{flag}</math> is the '''sparkled flagship bonus''' of <math>15</math>. 
* <math>\text{Mod}_\text{consort}</math> is the '''sparkled ship bonus''' of <math>5</math> for every other ship in the fleet.


'''Important Notes'''
* The flagship affects trigger rate disproportionately.
** Always place a sparkled ship as the flagship if you do not have the time to sparkle the rest of the fleet.
* The maximum chance for node support to trigger is '''91%''' and the lowest is '''51%'''.
** It is recommended that you sparkle all the ships for node support in order to get the maximum trigger chance. 
* Boss support can reach '''100%''' trigger chance with only the flagship sparkled.
** It is recommended that you at least sparkle the four heavy hitters in order to maximise accuracy.

=Support Types=
==Shelling Support==

This is the most commonly used support expedition. It is just a shelling attack against the whole enemy fleet.


'''Trigger Requirements'''
Meet '''all'' of the following requirements:
* 1 or more FBB/BB/BBV/CA/CAV in the fleet.
* Not more than 1 CVL/CV/CVB/AV/LHA.
* 2 or more FBB/BB/BBV '''OR''' 4 CA/CAV


'''Recommended Composition'''
* 3BB1CV2DD


'''Details'''
* Each ship in the support fleet targets a random enemy ship.
** Misses are also displayed on ships that aren't targeted.
* Damage is affected by '''engagement and formation'''
* Basic attack power is calculated in the same way as normal for [[Damage_Calculations#Surface_Shelling|surface ships]] and [[Damage_Calculations#Carrier Attacks|carriers]] except that '''firepower is reduced by 1'''.
* [[Hayasui]] uses the surface shelling formula instead of the carrier attack formula for support even when equipped with torpedo bombers.


'''Important Notes'''
* Shelling support deals the highest damage among all support types.
** It is the most likely to sink enemy ships.
* It costs the most out of all the support types.
** This is due to the requirements for battleships and heavy cruisers.
** You can control costs by using cheaper battleships and light carriers but '''it is not recommended to use heavy cruisers'''.
* Try to aim for 147 displayed firepower on battleships to meet the parallel cap (184 for head-on).
* For carriers, you need 52 displayed firepower to meet the parallel cap with a single 10{{Dive}} plane (77 for head-on).
** It is 39 for parallel and 64 for head-on with two 10{{Dive}} planes.


'''Equipment Setups'''

Any eligible ship type not mentioned in this table is subpar '''not recommended''' for use in support. The order of the equipment is for illustrative purposes only. You can place them in any order.

|{{RedGunHeavy}}{{Radar}}{{Radar}}{{Radar}}
|This is for high firepower battleships like the [[:Category:Yamato_Class|Yamato-class]] who can hit the parallel attack cap with a single high-firepower gun. Stacking all the extra radars will increase the chances that they manage to land a hit.
|-
|{{RedGunHeavy}}{{RedGunHeavy}}{{Radar}}{{Radar}}
|This is for battleships with '''95 to 120 firepower'''{{Firepower}} that require 2 guns to get to the parallel attack cap or for trying to hit the head-on cap. It is not recommended that you run more than two guns on a battleship because it will compromise their ability to land a hit.

==Airstrike Support==

Airstrike support functions much like a normal airstrike with a few major differences as detailed below.


'''Trigger Requirements'''
Meet '''one''' of the following requirements:
* At least 2 or more CVL/CV/CVB/AV/LHA in the fleet.
* 1 or more CVL/CV/CVB/AV/LHA and no FBB/BB/BBV/CA/CAV.
* 2 or more BBV/CAV/AV/LHA/AO and no FBB/BB/CA.


'''Recommended Composition'''
* 4CV2DD


'''Details'''
* Every plane slot targets a random enemy ship.
** This gives airstrike support up to 16 chances to hit.
* The attack will go through the normal [[Aerial Combat]] phases.
** This means that damage can be reduced by plane losses through the air control and anti-air fire phases.
** Planes in airstrike support appear to have some shoot down resistance that helps them survive anti-air fire.
** Enemy ships sunk in earlier combat phases '''are still counted''' towards contesting air control for airstrike support.
*** But the required fighter power for obtaining air control is reduced by planes lost in earlier air control phases.
* Airstrike support '''costs bauxite''' on top of the normal resupply costs because lost planes need to be resupplied.
* Taking jets on airstrike support still costs steel but does not trigger a jet assault phase.
* Ships which cannot launch bombers '''will not participate in airstrike support'''.
* Though the standard cost of airstrike support is 40% ammo, this only applies if '''there are 3 or more CVL/CV/CVB/AV''' in the fleet. Support will cost 80% ammo otherwise.
* Only visible stats are considered for airstrike support.
** This means all bonuses from upgrades or plane proficiency are ignored.
* Damage is calculated slightly differently compared to normal airstrikes. Please see [[Damage_Calculations#Airstrike|airstrike damage]] for details on the variables used.


<math>\text{Airstrike Support} = \biggl\lfloor \biggl\{ \text{Type} \times \bigl( \left( \text{DB or TP} \right) \times \sqrt{\text{Count}_\text{Plane}} + 3 \bigr) \biggr\} \times \text{Mod}_\text{crit} \biggr\rfloor \times 1.35</math>
* The [[Damage_Calculations#Damage_Formula|damage cap]] of 150 is applied to the result between <math>\{ \ \}</math>.
* <math>\text{Type}</math> is the bomber's type modifier, similar to airstrikes.
** <math>1.0</math> for dive bombers and seaplane bombers.
** Either <math>0.8</math> or <math>1.5</math> for torpedo bombers.
* The critical modifier and the 1.35x airstrike support modifier are both '''post-cap'''.


* Like airstrikes, damage is unaffected by formation or engagement.
* The accuracy appears to be lower than normal airstrikes.
* It does not appear in night battle nodes.
** But does appear in night-day nodes once the battle shifts to day.


'''Important Notes'''
* This support is useful for dealing with multiple lightly armoured ships or for racking up chip damage on high HP, high armour enemies.
* Because it follows after LBAS and regular airstrikes, your carriers can bring more bombers due to the reduced air control requirements.
* It is one of the cheapest supports to run as long as you have 3 or more carriers.
* Since slot size matters for damage, you should take the carriers with the largest slots to maximise damage.
* Due to damage being calculated off remaining planes, airstrike support can be reduced '''the more nodes it appears in''' due to plane losses.


'''Equipment Setups'''

Any eligible ship type not mentioned in this table is subpar '''not recommended''' for use in support. The order of the equipment is for illustrative purposes only. You should '''place bombers in the largest slots'''.

{| class="wikitable" style="width: 100%;"

|- 
|{{BluePlane}}{{BluePlane}}{{BluePlane}}{{GreenPlane}}
|This is the standard airstrike support setup. Because torpedo bombers have the best airstrike damage, it is best if you just stack them. The fighter is along to help with air control and reduce your bomber losses. It is not recommended that you run airstrike support with more than 1 fighter because you're better off running shelling support when encountering that much enemy airpower.

|- 
|N/A
|Because destroyers cannot participate in airstrike support, it doesn't matter what equipment they have.
|}

==Anti-Submarine Support==

Anti-Submarine support functions exactly like [[Support Expedition#Airstrike Support|airstrike support]]. Everything about airstrike support applies to ASW support with a few key differences.  


'''Trigger Requirements'''
* At least 1CVL present.  
* At least 1 additional CVL/AV/AO/LHA/CL/CT or 2DE


'''Recommended Composition'''
* 2CVL2CV2DD


'''Details'''
* All planes with an ASW stat '''except carrier-based fighters and jet fighter bombers''' will participate in support.
** They will not even contribute to determining air control, but they will not be shot down.
** Seaplane fighters and fighter bombers will participate.
* Although DDs and DEs are included in the fleet, they '''do not participate''' since it is a variant of airstrike support.
* If it encounters a mixed surface/sub fleet, only submarines will be attacked.
** It will still attack surface fleets with airstrike support if equipped with bombers.
* It only takes into account '''plane ASW''', equipping sonars and depth charges will be a waste.
* Damage is calculated slightly differently to airstrike support:


<math>\text{ASW Support} = \biggl\lfloor \biggl\{ \bigl(\text{ASW} \times \sqrt{\text{Count}_\text{Plane}} + 3 \bigr) \times \left(0.9 + \text{Rand} \right) \biggr\} \times \text{Mod}_\text{crit} \biggr\rfloor \times 1.35</math>
* The [[Damage_Calculations#Damage_Formula|damage cap]] of 150 is applied to the result between <math>\{ \ \}</math>.
* <math>\text{Rand}</math> is a random number from 0 to 0.75 inclusive.
* The critical modifier and the 1.35x airstrike support modifier are both '''post-cap'''.


'''Important Notes'''
* Because slot size matters, carriers make much better ASW support ships than light carriers.
* It has a chance of triggering at every node so consider the enemy compositions of all nodes when running ASW support to help with submarine nodes.
** A full ASW support setup that runs into enemy airpower will get destroyed.
* Because even the autogyros and liaison aircraft participate in aerial combat, they can be shot down.
* It can be useful for chipping down submarines to reduce the number of opening and closing torpedoes faced by your fleet.

'''Equipment Setups'''

==Long Range Torpedo Support==


This support exists to prevent you from using too many light cruisers and destroyers for cheap support. It appears as a torpedo strike with very low accuracy.  


'''Trigger Requirements'''
* Do not meet any of the requirements for shelling, airstrike or ASW support.


'''Important Notes'''
* Don't even bother using this.

=FAQ=


'''Q: Why didn't my support show up?'''

'''A:''' Double check that you have:
# Sent the the support to the right area.
# Sparkled the sufficient number of ships.
# Have the correct composition for support to appear.
# You resupplied the fleet before sending them off.
If all those are checked, it was just bad luck.


'''Q: I used 4BBV, why didn't support show up?'''  

'''A:''' Because that triggers airstrike support. If you had no seaplane bombers, that causes airstrike support to fail.


'''Q: Does support work in night battle nodes?'''

'''A:''' Yes, but only shelling support.


'''Q: Which support should I use?'''

'''A:''' Generally shelling. Airstrike and ASW support only have niche uses.


'''Q: Why isn't XX composition listed as recommended?'''

'''A:''' Because it is subpar and not worth your time. You're generally running support if there are tough things en-route that you need taken out. There's no point in cheaping out and increasing the randomness of the outcome.  


'''Q: Can I use XX ship with more guns/dive bombers for shelling instead?'''


'''A:''' It is advisable not to use ships which require too many guns or dive bombers to take to the parallel or head-on cap. Support requires all the accuracy it can muster to be effective.


'''Q: Do I really have to sparkle everyone?'''

'''A:''' You should have at least 4 ships sparkled for node support and the flagship sparkled for boss support. It is still recommended to sparkle the 4 heavy hitters for boss support because sparkling helps accuracy.


'''Q: Why is my morale going down so fast?'''  


'''A:''' Node support costs 1-5 morale and boss support costs 1-10.


'''Q: Can I try torpedo support?'''

'''A:''' No.
