Information regarding what the public held event revealed that people who came the Wine Festival most came dressed in a formal dress code (males came dressed in a suit, while women dressed up in a proper dress, do note that not everyone did this, but it was encouraged). Attendees who arrived there with thier tickets got thier goods upon the opening of the Festival. Ticket A participants got a specialized wine glass with the KanColle text and the silhouette of the soon to be revealed French Ship Girl on the glass.

During the Festival, people were able to listen to a piano recital in which Kancolle music was played in a large open ball room area. The piano was within the center of the ballroom area and people were seated in areas around outside the center area.

People who attended the party have been given a special Wine Bottle which contains the face of the new French Seaplane Tender [[Commandant Teste]] at the festival. During as the piano recital was playing, [[Commandant Teste|Commandant Teste's]] introduction line was also played during the festival, during which her name was revealed to everyone. It's been noted that her Japanese seems a little off , but may speak French very well suggesting she might be an entirely new Seiyuu. This however would later ber revealed that the Seiyuu was [Tanibe Yumi]], a former seiyuu in the KC scene who's done the voices of various members of the Shiratsuyu-class DDs.
