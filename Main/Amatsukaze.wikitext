{{clear}}

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''

:At first remodel, she has low firepower and a decent torpedo stat, making her hitting harder in night battle than at day, but not great at either.
:While not impressive in combat, do keep in mind than many maps require you to bring at least a few destroyers for routing.
:Furthermore, destroyers are cheap to deploy and can equip [[Drum Canister]], making them suited for expeditions.
:Her armor is higher than other destroyers can sport at first remodel.

:No further remodels have been implemented for her yet (as of January 2020).

===Important Information===
* An option for C15 and C21.
* Comes with a [[New High Pressure-Temperature Steam Boiler]] once remodeled.

*2015/2/6 Added as event drop for E-2 boss, G and H nodes with S rank during [[Fall 2014 Event]].
*After [[Shimakaze]] and [[Yukikaze]], Amatsukaze is the third DD to get a Holo (6) rarity.
*Like the Tone and Abukuma class, when used as modernization fodder Amatsukaze is one of the few destroyers that give a boost to all four stats.
*Survived a torpedo attack from the USS Redfin which blew off her bow after setting off her forward magazine and killed 80 of her crew; the rest of her crew abandoned her under the assumption she was too heavily damaged. She was found still afloat six days later by a Japanese patrol plane and was towed back to Singapore to be fitted with a temporary bow.
*Her name means "a wind blowing high in the sky".
*Sunk in action by the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Forces USAAF], April 6, 1945 near Amoy (now Xiamen), China ([http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Amatsukaze&params=24_30_N_118_10_E_ 24°30′N 118°10′E])
*Scuttled April 10, 1945
*In 2012, the wreckage of Amatsukaze was found by a Chinese engineering ship. About 30 tons of the wreckage was salvaged, cut into pieces and sold as scrap metal before the intervention of local relics administration departments.
