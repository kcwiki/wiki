[[File:146 3.png|thumb|right|The artwork for Kiso's second remodel.]]
#[[Kiso]] can now be remodelled a second time at level 65. (note: Kiso kai ni converts into a torpedo cruiser).
#Fixed carrier bug - they no longer launch planes on orange or less health (both in sortie map and PVP).
#Can now turn idle voices on/off in the volume options.
#You now know how much exp until the next level for your ships on the formation page, exp bar below the ship picture.
# Minor graphic fix for [[Souryuu]].
#Two new formation quests added.
#Remodelled heavy cruisers (except CAV) now use slightly less ammo.
