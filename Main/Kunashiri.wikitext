え、地味だろって。何それ！あの出撃の前に単冠湾の哨戒とか、大事な役割も務めたんだから。
大湊を起点に、千島列島や宗谷海峡、津軽海峡など大切なところを守ったの。ねえ、聞いてる？
最後は大切な大切なこと、頑張ったし。ちょっと神風さんに迷惑かけちゃったけど、頑張ったよね、あたし！
| translation =I'm the 2nd ship of the Shimushu-class coastal defence ships, Kunashiri. Leave protecting the north to me.
Eh, I look a bit plain. What! You know I had the important duty of patrolling Hitokappu Bay before that sortie.
I protected all sorts of important places like the Kuril Islands, the La Pérouse Strait, and the Tsugaru Strait​ while based in Oominato. Hey, are you listening?
In the end I worked very, very hard on important things. Although I did cause a little bit of trouble for Kamikaze, I did my best!<ref>"That sortie" refers to the Attack on Pearl Harbour. The fleet that did that attack departed from Hitokappu Bay.
Kamikaze ended up grounding herself as well while attempting to rescue Kunashiri after her grounding.</ref>

Yup, do your best!<ref>During an incident while pulling into Paramushir, Kunashiri - who was captained by Cmdr Kitamura - received a signal from Nenohi - who was captained by Lt-Cmdr Terauchi - saying "Why have you not saluted us".
