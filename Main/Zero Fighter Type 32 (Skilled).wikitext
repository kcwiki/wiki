==Introduction==

熟練搭乗員で構成された「零式艦上戦闘機32型」装備の艦戦隊です。
翼端を切り落としたスタイルの21型の性能向上型「32型」は、航続距離などに課題もありましたが、
精鋭の熟練搭乗員が駆る同機は、ラバウル、そしてソロモン上空の激戦を支えました。

''A carrier-based squadron made up of skilled crew equipped with the "Model 32 Zero".''<br>
''The Model 32 was an improvement over the Model 21, it had its wingtips squared off and although it had issues with range, it was piloted by skilled elites in Rabaul and in the fierce battles in the skies above Solomon.''
