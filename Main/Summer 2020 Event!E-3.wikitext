|tips = <br> '''Disclaimer: The following guide is a preliminary release for this event map, it contains information from early tests, do note that some things are subject to change as more information is gathered over the event and thus the guide is subject to change.'''

'''Preparation'''

'''The event is likely to have several shiplocks (E-1 to E-4 already contain 4 separate locks), please plan your locks carefully.'''

This map consists of two unlocking phases and one boss HP phase. For all phases, Fighter Power, (O)ASW, and/or CV(L)s are useful.

The following things could be considered for this map:

# Do you have enough strong/historical DD/ CL/ DE and equipment to bring into this map for OASW?
# Do you have enough fighters/ interceptors to get AS across all conditions on the map?
# Do you have access to spare/historical CV(L)s while keeping your better CV(L/B)s in reserve for later maps?


'''Ship Bonuses (Tentative)'''

{{:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/E-3/historical_ships}}

'''Ships marked with * also have bonuses in other maps.''' [[Yamakaze]], [[Asashimo]] and [[Isuzu]] are safe choics to lock here. [[Uzuki]] can also be considered, but her useage will likely be limited.

Avoid using all other historical ships on this map.

'''Phase 1: Eliminating the enemy fleet around the Goto Island area (part 1)'''

In this phase you will need to complete a series of steps around the map to successfully open up a path to the next phase of the operation. Both single fleet as well as combined fleet are viable here. However, note that it is '''entirely possible''' to clear this map using only a '''single fleet''' (albeit with slightly greater difficulty in some places), so you may want to conserve shiplocks for later maps.

For the first step you will need to complete the following steps:

# Get AS on node B (Hard Only)
# Get S rank (Hard Mode) or A Rank (Medium or less) on Node N
# Get S rank(Medium+) or A Rank (Easy or Less) on Node L 
# Get AS on a Land Base Air Raid (Twice for Hard / Once for Normal)

'''Get AS on node B (Hard Only)'''

This path will have your fleet go through a series of air attacks and submarines. Using a combination of your LBAS along with a fighter mule of carriers should be enough to clear this task. A single fleet should more than suffice for clearing this requirement.

* '''Route: D-C-A-B'''
* '''Composition: 1-2 CV(L), 0-1 BBV, 1 CL, 2-3 DD'''
* '''LBAS: 1 Base, 2 Range to node. (Both to node B)'''
** '''LBAS Recommendation: 1 Land Base, 4 fighters/interceptors'''
* Node C and B are air battle nodes. Bring a fighter mule team and an AACI ship to make the trip easier.
* Node A has subs, use ASW ships if necessary.
**If you have enough good OASW planes and can secure AS with your fleet alone, you could send LBAS to handle the submarine node instead.
* FP of 449 or higher is needed for AS on this node.

* '''LBAS: 1 Base, 2 Range to node. (Both to node)'''

* FP of 449 or higher is needed for AS on this node.

Once completed, you'll hear a ding upon returning to base.

'''S Rank on Nodes L and N'''

These requirements will have your fleet go through a series of air attack and submarine nodes, before facing an abyssal combined fleet. Together with LBAS, a single fleet can still comfortable handle the route and enemy combined fleet.

Below are the methods needed for each nodes:

'''Node L'''

<tabber>
|-|Single Fleet Method=
* '''Route: D-E-F-G-H-I-L'''
* '''Composition: 1-2 CV(L), 0-1 BBV, 1 CL, 2-3 DD'''
* '''LBAS: 1-2 Bases, 6 Range to node. (Both to node L)'''
** '''LBAS Recommendation: 1-2 Land Base, 2 Fighters, 2 Bombers'''
* Node H is an air attack bring decent air power and an AACI ship to make the trip easier.
* Node E has subs, bringing (O)ASW can help.
* Node I will be a small surface fleet, consider vanguard formation.
* There is an LoS check from I-L.
* Node L will be a combined fleet consisting of 2 light carriers, 1 Heavy Cruiser, some Light Cruisers and several Destroyers.
|-| Combined Fleet Comp=
* '''Route: D-E-F-G-H-I-L'''
* '''Composition: CTF: 2CV(L), 1 BBV, 3 XX + 1CL 2 DD 3XX '''
* '''LBAS: 1-2 Bases, 6 Range to node. (Both to node L)'''
** '''LBAS Recommendation: 1-2 Land Base, 2 Fighters, 2 Bombers'''
* Node H is an air attack bring decent air power and an AACI ship to make the trip easier.
* Node E has subs, bringing (O)ASW can help.
* Node I will be a small surface fleet, you may face issues with this node, but can bring an FCF to help pass the node should others take damage.
* There is an LoS check from I-L.
* Node L will be a combined fleet consisting of 2 light carriers, 1 Heavy Cruiser, some Light Cruisers and several Destroyers.

Once completed, you'll hear a ding upon returning to base.

'''Node N'''

<tabber>
|-|Single Fleet Method=
* '''Route: D-E-F-G-K-N'''
* '''Composition: 1-2 CV(L), 1 CL, 3 DD''' ('''Fast''' Fleet)
* '''LBAS: 1-2 Bases, 6 Range to node. (Both to node N)'''
** '''LBAS Recommendation: 1-2 Land Base, 2 Fighters, 2 Bombers'''
* Node K is an air attack, bring decent air power and an AACI ship to make the trip easier.
* Node E has subs, bringing (O)ASW can help.
* Node N will be a combined fleet consisting of 2 light carriers, 1 Heavy Cruiser, some Light Cruisers and several Destroyers.
|-| Combined Fleet Comp=
* '''Route: D-E-F-G-H-I-L'''
* '''Composition: 1-2 CV(L), 1 BBV, 3XX + 1 CL, 2 DD, 3 DD''' ('''Fast''' Fleet)
* '''LBAS: 1-2 Bases, 6 Range to node. (Both to node N)'''
** '''LBAS Recommendation: 1-2 Land Base, 2 Fighters, 2 Bombers'''
* Node K is an air attack bring decent air power and an AACI ship to make the trip easier.
* Node E has subs, bringing (O)ASW can help.
* Node L will be a combined fleet consisting of 2 light carriers, 1 Heavy Cruiser, some Light Cruisers and several Destroyers.
|-|
</tabber>

Once completed, you'll hear a ding upon returning to base.

'''Get AS on a Land Base Air Raid (Twice for Hard / Once for Normal)'''

You can clear this while fulfilling other requirements if for some reason you are not using all LBAS to support your fleet at battle nodes. Otherwise, deployed 1 SS(V) until your LBAS gets attacked should suffice.

* '''LBAS: 1-2 Bases, (Set on Air Defense)'''
** '''LBAS Recommendation: 1-2 Land Base, 4 Fighters/ Interceptors.'''

Even though the game’s display does not show high altitude bombers equipped on the enemies, the carrier planes are are treated as if they were high altitude bombers, so jet interceptors should be used where available. 

Once completed, you'll hear a ding upon returning to base. Once all conditions are met, a new series of nodes will automatically open.

'''Phase 2: Eliminating enemy fleet around the Goto Island area (part 2)

In this phase you will need to complete a series of steps around the map to successfully open up a path way to the boss of the operation. This will require you to organize a fleet which you can choose between using a single or combined fleet to complete the task.

Keep in mind however that it is '''entirely possible''' to clear this map using only a '''single fleet'''. So weigh your options carefully as you play through this map.

For the first step you will need to complete the following steps:

# Get S rank (Hard) or A Rank (Casual- Medium) on Node R
# Get S rank (Hard) or A Rank (Medium) on Node S 


'''Get S rank (Hard) or A Rank (Casual- Medium) on Node R'''

This path will have your fleet go through a series of air attacks and submarines. Overall you will need a strong fleet that can tackle the combined fleet to make it easier to clear. Once again, '''this is preferred to be done with a single fleet''' if possible.

Below are the methods needed for each nodes:

'''Node R'''

<tabber>
|-|Single Fleet Method=
* '''Route: D-C-A-B-P-R'''
* '''Composition: 2 CV(L), 1 BBV, 1 CL, 2-3 DD'''
* '''LBAS:  Base #1, 2 Range to node. (Place on nodes C and A)'''
** '''LBAS Recommendation:  Land Base #1, 4 Fighters'''
* '''LBAS:  Base #2, 3 Range to node. (Both on node P)'''
** '''LBAS Recommendation:  Land Base #2, 2 Fighters, 2 Bombers '''
* Node C and B are air attack bring decent air power and an AACI ship to make the trip easier.
* Node A has subs, bringing ASW isn't entirely necessary but may be needed.
* Node P will be a small surface fleet, considered vanguard formation.
* Node R will be a combined fleet consisting of Standard and Light carriers carriers, 1 Heavy Cruiser, some Light Cruisers and a bunch of Destroyers. Node can be handled in a similar way like the previous node requirements
|-| Combined Fleet Comp=
* '''Route: D-C-A-B-P-R'''
* '''Composition: 2 CV(L), 1 BBV, 3XX + 1 CL, 2 DD, 3 XX’''
* '''LBAS:  Base #1, 2 Range to node. (Place on nodes C and A)'''
** '''LBAS Recommendation:  Land Base #1, 4 Fighters'''
* '''LBAS:  Base #2, 3 Range to node. (Both on node P)'''
** '''LBAS Recommendation:  Land Base #2, 2 Fighters, 2 Bombers '''
* Node C and B are air attack bring decent air power and an AACI ship to make the trip easier.
* Node A has subs, bringing ASW isn't entirely necessary but may be needed.
* Node P will be a small surface fleet, you may need to bring an FCF to help pull out heavily damage escort ships if they take damage since escorts will attack first.
* Node R will be a combined fleet consisting of Standard and Light carriers carriers, 1 Heavy Cruiser, some Light Cruisers and a bunch of Destroyers. Node can be handled in a similar way like the previous node requirements

</tabber>

Overall the node is not difficult to clear and once done a ding sound will occur at your home port menu.

'''Get S rank (Hard) or A Rank (Medium) on Node S'''

This path will have your fleet go through a series of air attacks and submarines. You will ultimately have to fight a mixed fleet consisting of subs, destroyers and transport. '''A single fleet is required in this path.'''

* '''Route: D-E-F-G-H-S'''
* '''Composition: 2 CV(L), 1 BBV, 1 CL, 2-3 DD'''
* '''LBAS:  Base 1-2, 2 Range to node. (All on Node S)'''
** '''LBAS Recommendation:  Land Base 1-2, 4 Bombers'''
* Node H are air attack bring decent air power and an AACI ship to make the trip easier.
* Node E has subs, bringing ASW is required.
* Node S is a mixed fleet, you will need a fleet that can take out subs with ASW while also taking out the surface ships.

As long as you bring DDs that can OASW and a fleet to attempt to fight any surviving surface ships following the LBAS air raid, completing this process should be simple.

Once done a ding sound will occur at your home port menu. When all conditions are met, the path to the boss is now open.

'''Phase 3: Sink the Gotou Islands Seabed Princess'''

In this phase of the operation you will need to organize a strong ASW single fleet that will be needed to take out the [[Gotou Islands Seabed Princess]]. You will not need air power, but you will need a suitable amount of LoS of 18 Cn1 (LoS might be lower if DEs are used [TBC]) to reach the boss. The fights will have you go up a new path where you'll have to pass through some surface ships. Depending on how you approach it you will need to go through T and possibly V to reach the boss depending on the comp. But depending on how difficult it is to take out the boss, you may need to depend on bringing a BBV to give you the edge you need to clear it.


<tabber>
|-| Light Fleet Method=
* '''Route: D-E-F-U-T-O'''
* '''Composition: 1-2CV(L), 1 CL, 3-4 DD/DE'''
* '''LBAS:  Base 1-2, 3 Range to boss. (All on Boss node)'''
** '''LBAS Recommendation:  1-2 Land Base , 2 ASW Bomber 2 Bombers'''
* Node T is a light surface fleet you'll want to evade to prevent damage, use vanguard formation.
* Node O is a mix of subs and surface ships. You main objective will be to take out the [[Gotou Islands Seabed Princess]] so prioritize taking her out with ASW and depend on your LBAS to finish the surface ships.
|-|Heavy Fleet Method=
* '''Route: D-E-F-U-T-O'''
* '''Composition: 1BBV, 1 CL, 4 DD/DE'''
* '''LBAS:  Base 1-2, 3 Range to boss. (All on Boss node)'''
** '''LBAS Recommendation:  1-2 Land Base , 2 ASW Bomber 2 Bombers'''
* Node T is a light surface fleet you'll want to evade to prevent damage, use vanguard formation.
* Node V is a stronger mixed fleet you'll want to evade to prevent damage, use vanguard formation.
* Node O is a mix of subs and surface ships. Your main objective will be to take out the [[Gotou Islands Seabed Princess]] so prioritize taking her out with ASW and depend on your LBAS to finish the surface ships.
*Surviving the trip this route might be harder, but will allow a 2nd turn in ASW attacks

The  [[Gotou Islands Seabed Princess]] herself is a simple boss that can be beaten with a good set of ASW planes (or Toukai) and a strong OASW team of ships, if worse comes to worse and you cannot beat her, you can consider using the heavier ASW comp to get an extra turn in. However if the boss proves to still be difficult, you can resort to the debuff strategy listed below.

'''Phase 4: Debuff the Gotou Islands Seabed Princess (Optional)'''

If for some reason you are unable to defeat the [[Gotou Islands Seabed Princess]] you can consider completing the debuff phase which can be done on all difficulties. The steps required to complete this are as followed:

# Get the [[Gotou Islands Seabed Princess]] to Last Dance
# Get AS at your Land Base Twice
# Get S rank on Node S Twice

For these steps you can review the process from Phase 1 and Phase 2 that provide clear these steps. Once these conditions are complete, the princess will be debuffed and all ships will get a 1.08x modifier against her.

From there, proceed back to the previous phase and finish off the boss.

Once the [[Gotou Islands Seabed Princess]] is defeated the operation is considered complete.
