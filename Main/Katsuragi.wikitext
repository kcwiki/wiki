*Was available as reward from the [[Spring 2015 Event]] from clearing E-2. 
*Her initial appearance and equipment is a reference to how she never got her air wing as they were assigned elsewhere when she was completed and also how she spent her career moored and camouflaged in Kure.
*She survived the [[wikipedia:Bombing_of_Kure_(July_1945)|bombing campaign]] that took out many of the ships she was stationed with relatively untouched, with only one bomb hit. As such, she did survive the war.
*After the war, she was used as a transport for retrieving Japanese nationals before being scrapped on 22 December 1946.
