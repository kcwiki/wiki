* Option for quest F20

===Analysis===
Priority: 

* Kai: '''Medium'''
: She will likely be the first carrier that you come across because she is a quest reward. Her important stats being slightly better than average means she will serve you well as an early carrier. Her good slot count is let down by her less than ideal slot distribution. The two medium slots being only 20 and positioned on top means she risks getting them emptied when facing heavy enemy anti-air. In that situation, she can lose her ability to perform artillery spotting and plane proficiency bonuses. 

* Kai Ni: '''Low'''
: She doesn't really improve much slot-wise at Kai Ni. However, she does gain a 5th slot that gives her incredible flexibility. She can easily find room for recon planes to help LoS or other utility equipment like radar for routing in events. She can also contribute a lot more fighter support than other carriers while still maintaining strike power. Her increase to firepower is also another welcome buff. However, her remodel is expensive and not worth the cost for most players. Her Kai Ni is strictly a late-game upgrade.

* Kai Ni E: '''Low'''
: Her top two slots actually get worse at Kai Ni E. The slots are quite small and will be prone to getting emptied by heavy enemy anti-air. She is a powerful night carrier that can hit the night battle cap with ease while still maintaining strike power during the day. That said, her niche role means it is better to keep her in her Kai Ni form unless you have the night planes required to make her useful.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''

: Though she has the largest single slot of any carrier, she is let down by her slot distribution and her average firepower. The two medium slots being only 20 and positioned on top means she risks getting them emptied when facing heavy enemy anti-air. In that situation, she can lose her ability to perform artillery spotting and plane proficiency bonuses. Furthermore, her rarity and lack of an upgrade path means you shouldn't focus too much on her.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''High'''
: She is a below average CV in her kai form. Her only saving grace is that she is cheap to run. Her 18 slots are small and liable to be emptied by heavy enemy anti-air. This can compromise her ability to take advantage of plane proficiency bonuses and artillery spot. 
: Her Kai Ni has a low remodel level and is cheap. When combined with her above good firepower, it makes her a decent carrier. She is still let down by her slot distribution because her top slot is still 18. She does get a buff to her large slot which gives her a harder hitting airstrike. It is important that she gets to Kai Ni quickly because she gives you access to the Suisei Egusa.

===Analysis===
Priority:

* Kai: '''Medium'''
: Her Kai suffers from a lack of firepower which means she is lackluster at shelling. Her good plane count is somewhat let down by the even slot distribution but that makes her flexible since she can increase or decrease the amount of fighters or bombers she takes without compromising too much. This does make her a bit of a jack of all trades, master of none. 

* Kai Ni: '''Low'''
: Her Kai Ni improves upon everything her Kai can do but at a steep cost. It does bring a significant increase to her firepower which increases her combat ability. Now, she can do powerful shelling attacks in addition to her airstrikes.

* Kai Ni A: '''High'''
: Her Kai Ni A increases her firepower further and provides a significant upgrade to her slot distribution. She now gets a large top slot and a respectable 2nd slot that makes her even better at being a shelling carrier. She does lose her flexibility with her plane loadouts but that doesn't matter much. In addition, she also gains the ability to shell while moderately damaged. All this makes this remodel well worth the expense.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Medium'''

: She has decent firepower but is let down somewhat by her slot distribution. Her slots being nearly evenly distributed makes her good for launching airstrikes since it spreads the damage around. Her large slot being on top reduces the chances of her losing out on plane proficiency bonuses. Additionally, her two medium slots being on the large side in their own right means she is less at risk of losing the ability to artillery spot. Her ability to shell at moderate damage is another bonus. However, she is only available from LSC which makes her expensive to obtain.

: She is a workable carrier with decent firepower but is let down by her slot count and distribution. Her top slot being small will limit her ability to maintain the plane proficiency bonus against heavy enemy anti-air. Furthermore, her two large slots aren't really that large.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''

: Although she has decent firepower, her slot distribution hurts her a lot. Since every other slot besides her top slot is small, she doesn't have a lot of striking power. It also means she can easily lose her ability to artillery spot. Her innate night attack is just a gimmick since it is a normal shelling attack that is based off her low firepower. Since she is also an event-only ship, her performance is not worth her rarity.

: She has very low firepower, HP and armour. While her slot count is not the lowest, her slot distribution is very bad. Her top slot being so small means she risks losing the plane proficiency bonus and the ability to artillery spot. Her large slot is decent but not large enough to give her a good airstrike to make up for her shortcomings. Though she is cheap to run, she is event-only. So her performance is not worth her rarity.

===Analysis===
Priority: 

* Kai: '''Medium'''
: She has good firepower which makes her a good combatant. She is let down by her slot distribution. While she has a large top slot that makes for a powerful airstrike, her other slots being small means they risk being emptied. This can potentially disable her ability to artillery spot. 

* Mk.II: '''High'''
: Her Mk.II remodel is unique in that it does not require [[Night Operation Aviation Personnel]] to trigger night carrier cut-ins. This leaves more room for attack planes which gives her the most powerful night attack of the carriers. It also means she doesn't need to compromise her daytime combat ability.
: In addition to her special ability, her firepower and slot distribution is excellent. Her two large slots being on top means that she can more easily maintain her ability to artillery spot and the plane proficiency bonus. Her remodel does come at a steep cost but it is well worth it for her abilities.

* Mk.II mod.2: '''Medium'''
: She loses the innate ability to attack at night with her mod.2 remodel but gains the ability to shell while moderately damaged. She also loses a bit of firepower but gains plane count. Her slot distribution remains good and she is a good shelling carrier.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Air Support
* Shelling Support

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Airstrike Support

===Important Info===

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''

: She has decent firepower which is complemented by her slot distribution. This allows her to perform adequately as a shelling carrier. The size of her two large slots also means she has adequate airstrike power. She is a balnced carrier but her performance isn't worth her rarity. Her innate night attack is weak and not worth consideration.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Air Support

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Shelling Support

===Analysis===
Priority: '''High'''

: She has decent firepower with excellent plane counts and slot distribution. The size of her top two slots make it highly unlikely that they will be emptied and gives her a very powerful airstrike. Her 3rd slot is also a respectable size that gives her the option of adding to her airstrike power or bringing fighters. While she may be event-only, she is absolutely worth the effort to obtain.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Air Support
* Shelling Support
* Airstrike Support
