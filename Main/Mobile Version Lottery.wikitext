From [[Game Updates/2016/February 29|February 29th, 2016]] to [[Game Updates/2016/March 11|March 11th, 2016]], Kantai Collection held a lottery for the new '''Official Mobile Android Version''' of the game which was tied in directly to your '''Kantai Collection Web Browser account'''. To allow players to partake in the Android Lottery, they changed their '''Fleet Friend''' icon (which has been greyed out since the game's premiere) and made it into the '''Mobile Version Lottery'''. 

==Participating in the Mobile Version Lottery==
In order to participate in the mobile version lottery, players had to to have an active game Kantai Collection Game account on DMM's website. Upon starting up the game, on the top of the screen the second button to the right of the former '''"Fleet Friend"''' button had been changed into the '''"Mobile Version Lottery"''' and would be glowing red.

Once the switch was flipped the switch your account would be placed within the lottery, you could however choose to opt out from participating in the Android Lottery by pressing the lever again to opt out.
