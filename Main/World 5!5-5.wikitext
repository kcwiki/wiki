*You must sink the Boss 5 times to clear the map.
*Clearing this map rewards 1 medal and 200 points for ranking. The boss HP bar is reset at midnight of the beginning of each month, allowing the reward to be obtained again.
**'''The enemy composition at the boss node will be locked into either formation 5 or 6 after clearing'''. If you are planning on clearing any quests that require you to clear 5-5 with an A/S-Rank, '''it is recommended that you attempt these quests after clearing 5-5 for the month''', as the post-clear boss compositions are significantly less dangerous than the pre-clear comps. The fleet composition restrictions for most of these quests mean that your fleet will face some difficulty in defeating the pre-clear comps, particularly after the buff to the Southern War Princess in [[Winter 2019 Event]] (who does not appear at all in post-clear comps).
***This is especially true if said quests require 2DDs, as DDs will face difficulty in dealing any significant damage to the pre-clear boss comps during the daytime battle
***Please note that [[Submarine Yo-Class]] at the boss node will be in Elite form post-clear, so a dedicated OASW ship must be brought if one wishes to secure a S-rank.
*As with all World 5 maps, support expeditions 33 and 34 are applicable on this map.
*Node B is a submarine node.
*Nodes G and M are night battles.

===Tips===
*5-5 is one of the few maps that has arguably become more difficult after the Phase 2 update.
**2 of the pre-clear boss compositions now contain 2 Elite Re-class Abyssals.
**The [[Southern War Princess]] has also gained additional armour followed by [[Winter 2019 Event]]
***Her escort has been slightly weakened to compensate for this. The Submarine in her escort has been changed from an Elite variant to a basic variant.
**The addition of CL Tsu-class to multiple nodes has also made the map potentially more costly in terms of bauxite.
**Pre-boss Node P still has the chance of containing an Elite Re-class in Line Ahead.
**Depending on your choice of ships (and also dependent on engagement modifiers & enemy fleet formation), bulges equipped in Reinforcement Expansion slots may improve survivability against opening torpedoes.
**Support Expedition(s) may help as well.
*However, routing to the boss is now guaranteed with the correct composition(s) and sufficient LoS. Speed is also no longer a major factor in determining routing.
*The special attack (Touch mechanic) from [[Nelson|Nelson Kai]], [[Nagato|Nagato Kai Ni]] and [[Mutsu|Mutsu Kai Ni]] are also a good option to consider if you want to clear out enemies at the boss node easier.

<br/>'''Recommended Fleet'''
*'''North : B-K-P-S or B-F-J-P-S: 4 (F)BB(V)/CV(L/B) + 2 XX'''
**LoS required: '''≥ 81 F33 Cn2'''
**Maximum of 4 (F)BB(V)/CV(L/B), otherwise chance of off-routing at pre-boss node P.
**Routing B->K or B->F will depend on your fleet. Fleet with either 3CV(B) or 4(F)BB(V)s will always go to K, otherwise will go to F as long as you have 2 DDs.
**F is a choice node. For the above fleet, routing to J is recommended as D is a maelstrom node, and fleet comp will route to P after H anyway.
**CAVs can help provide additional fighter power, allowing for optimized set-ups on CVs.
**[[Ise|Ise Kai Ni]] is another option if additional fighter power is needed. However, keep in mind that she is significantly weaker in terms of firepower compared to almost every other battleship.
**Seaplane Bombers should not be used in smaller slots due to the potential presence of multiple [[Light Cruiser Tsu-Class]] along this route.
*'''Middle : B-F-D-H-N-O-S: 2 (F)BB(V) + 2 CA(V) + 2 DD'''
**LoS required: '''≥ 67 F33 Cn2'''
**Easier preboss, but will struggle against the double Re Elite boss node formations
**CAV can be replaced with CLT (Maximum 1 CLT)
**D node is a maelstrom node that wipe out your fuel. Recommended to bring some radars to reduce the loss.
*'''South : A-C-E-G-I-M-O-S: 2 [(F)BB(V)+CV(B/L)] + 4 DD'''
**LoS required: '''≥ 67 F33 Cn2'''
**The first battle is a relatively easy enemy torpedo squadron, but the next two battles are fairly dangerous night battles
***Pre-boss support shelling expeditions can help stabilize the night battles significantly
**Fleets that take this route will struggle significantly against the double Re Elite boss node formations
**Generally lower bauxite consumption when compared to other routes
