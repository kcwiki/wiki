This is the world's first mass-produced rocket-powered fighter developed and put into service by the Country of Science.
This is a Japanese-made prototype rocket-powered fighter developed jointly by the IJA and IJN based on valuable, but incomplete, blueprints brought back by the I-class submarine.
It was made to intercept heavy bombers at distant, high altitudes that were difficult for regular aircraft with reciprocating engines.
