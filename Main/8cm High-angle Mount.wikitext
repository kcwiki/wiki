==Introduction==
新開発の長8cm高角砲です。<br>
秋月型に装備された長10cm高角砲の小型軽量化を目指した対空用副砲バージョンです。<br>
微妙な出来という評価もありますが、後期の建造艦艇への装備が期待されていました。<br><br>

This is the new long 8cm high-angle gun.<br><br>

It is a miniaturized and lightened anti-air secondary gun version of the Akizuki class's long 10cm high angle gun.<br><br>

While it is evaluated to be of little improvement, it was anticipated by the warships built later into the war.

==Notes==

| [[File:Type-agano.jpg|thumbnail|Now buildable!]] || 
'''Buildable''' as of the [[Game Updates/2015/June 12th|Kako K2 update]], June 12, 2015. Stock equipment of [[Agano]]-class CLs.

This can be built using (10F/10A/20S/10B) with a CL as the flagship. As with the [[15.2cm Twin Gun Mount]], this is also a possible by-product of the small guns and shells recipe (10F/90A/90S/30B).
