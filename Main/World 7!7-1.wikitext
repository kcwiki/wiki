** Amount of ships in fleet = 6
** Fleet contains (F)BB(V) or CV(L/B) '''AND''' no SS(V)
* If fleet contains '''SS(V)''':
** If amount of ships ≤ 4, random routing between B, D and F.
** If amount of ships ≥ 5, random routing between B and D.
** If fleet contains (F)BB(V) or CV(L/B), random routing between B and D.

** No SS(V)

*Go to I if fleet contains AO
* Meeting '''ANY''' of the following requirements routes you to K:
** Fleet contains DD '''AND''' amount of DE ≥ 3
** Amount of CL = 1 '''AND''' amount of DD ≥ 4
*Higher chance of going to K if the amount of ships in fleet = 5
*Otherwise, random routing (Small chance for node J)

===Tips===
*'''Clearing this map is required in order to open World 4-2.'''
*To clear this map, '''the boss Submarine So-Class Flagship must be sunk three times.'''
**This is an anti-submarine operation, where use of ships capable of using opening ASW attacks (OASW) is highly recommended.
**Node G however, is a surface battle against an enemy torpedo squadron
**Use of Light/Torpedo Cruisers and Destroyers capable of using opening ASW attacks either from being able to reach 100 Icon ASW stat or having built-in OASW capabilities (e.g. Isuzu Kai Ni) is highly recommended.
**Use of DE is an option as well, but due to their poor firepower and defensive stats, they may have trouble surviving Node G.
**Using 6 ships will cause fleets to route to Node B.

<br/>'''Recommended Fleet'''
*'''1CL 4DD (exactly 5 ships, no more)'''
**Fixed routing towards the boss, routes '''DEGHK'''
**Use of a Light Cruiser capable of opening attacks against surface ships is an option for Node G .
***Opening torpedo attack (Abukuma Kai Ni or Yura Kai Ni)
***Opening airstrike via Seaplane Seaplane Bombers (e.g. Remodeled Agano-class)
**Bringing Destroyers capable of OASW is highly advised (100 ASW stat or built-in capability).
***If ASW stat is high enough to reach OASW without three equipments, or if the ship has built-in OASW capability, mixing surface combat equipment and ASW equipment together can help stabilize the surface battle at Node G.
*'''Fleet that has only 4 ships''' : (e.g '''3 CLT 1 CL / 2 CL 2 CLT''', etc...)
**Can also reach the Boss Node, but have a chance to off-route into dead-end instead.
**Do not bring AO as you will be directed to node I instead of the boss node.
