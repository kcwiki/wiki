==Trivia==

* The Atlanta-class of light cruisers were a series of eight ships originally intended as scout cruisers or flotilla leaders. However, their dual-purpose main armament made them very effective at engaging enemy aircraft. Ultimately, this would become their primary duty during the Pacific War, serving as screens and escorts for American aircraft carriers. However, they were poor at engaging surface targets, due to their lack of sufficient armor protection.
* Launched on September 6, 1941, and commissioned in December 24, 1941.
* Scuttled after severe damage in Naval Battle of Guadalcanal by friendly fire from USS San Francisco in 13 November 1942.
* The ship earned a total of 5 battle stars for her service. Among the battles she participated in included the Battle of Midway, Battle of Santa Cruz, and First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal.
* The wreck of USS Atlanta was discovered first time in 1992.
* Her wreck is divable, albeit being at around 90 meters this pleasure is reserved for the best of the best.
