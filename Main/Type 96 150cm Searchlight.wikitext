==Introduction==
戦艦装備用の大型探照灯です。<br>夜戦時に敵に照射することで味方艦隊の攻撃を支援できますが、照射艦は敵艦隊からの集中攻撃を浴びるリスクがあります。<br>(戦艦級のみが装備可能です)<br>
''Large-scale searchlight fitted for battleships.''<br>
''Shining the searchlight at the enemy can assist friendly ship's attacks during the night battle, but there is risk of having the enemy focus their fire on the user.''<br>
''(Only battleships may equip this)''
