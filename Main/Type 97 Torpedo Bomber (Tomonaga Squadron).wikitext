==Introduction==
優れた航続距離を誇り、速度や防弾装備は劣るものの、初期の機動部隊艦載機の主力攻撃機として大活躍した傑作艦上攻撃機「九七艦攻」。本部隊は、闘志と高い技量を兼ね備えた友永隊長の率いる九七艦攻隊です。

''The Type 97 torpedo bomber was the mainstay attack aircraft during the early days of the Carrier Task Force, renowned for its operational range despite being slow and unarmored. This squadron was led by Commander Tomonaga who was spirited and highly skilled.''
