[[File:Hishimochi-Quest-bannner.png|center]]
The '''Hishimochi Mini-Event of 2021''' is a variation of the Hishimochi event, where players can complete a series of quests in order to collect Hishimochi, which in turn is used to obtain valuable materials and resources, such as [[Blueprint]]s, [[Prototype Flight Deck Catapult]], and even a selection of DEs. The event started on March 1, 2021.

In order to collect the Hishimochi, you will need to complete quests. Do note that these quests are weeklies and one times, and will only be available for a limited period of time.

Once the event ends, all Hishimochi will expire and be removed, along with the quests.

==Quests==

In this time-limited Quest event, there are a total of 8 currently known quests available. The following should be noted about them:

* 4 Quests are Weeklies (3 Hishimochi Obtaining Quests, 1 Hishimochi Exchange Quest)
* 4 Quests are One Time (1 Hishimochi Obtaining Quests, 3 Hishimochi Exchange Quest)
* Existence of more exchange quests is still to be determined.

As you collect the Hishimochi, you can use them to exchange for stuff in later quests. It is recommended to conserve your Mochi first before you spend them on resources, as you will need them to complete the quests.

== Exchange Rate ==

Hishimochi can be opened through the item screen and exchanged between three different colours:

{| class="wikitable" 
|- style="font-weight:bold;"
! colspan="3" style="text-align:center;" | [[File:Mochi_selection_new.png|300px|Selection]]
|-
| [[File:Mochi_pink_new.png|250px|Selection]]
| [[File:Mochi_white_new.png|250px|Selection]]
| [[File:Mochi_green_new.png|250px|Selection]]
|- style="text-align:center;"
| style="text-align:left;" | Pink: ({{Fuel}}✕ 600 and {{Bauxite}}✕ 200)
| White: ([[Fatigue#Food_Supply_Ship_.22Irako.22|Irako]]✕ 1)
| Green: ([[File:Instant_repair_2.png|30px]]✕ 2 and [[file:Improvement Materials.png|30px]]✕ 1)
|}

You should not consider this option until you have completed all relevant quests you want to clear, as those require existing Hishimochi in inventory to be consumed by the quests during the process.

== Notes ==
<big>'''Avoid spending your Hishimochi on resources until you have completed all relevant quests you want to clear.'''</big>
