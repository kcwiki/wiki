==Ship Bonuses (Tentative)==
{{:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/E-3/Historical_Ships}}

==Overview==
* This map contains 4 phases.
* Three [[LBAS|Land-Based Air Squadrons]] are available for sortie.
** The air base is relocated once you've reached Phase 4.
* There are 2 event quests linked to this map.
* This map has 4 shiplock tags. The shiplock tags are applied on all difficulties, but they are only enforced on '''Hard'''.
** The shiplock restrictions are lifted once the map is cleared. This makes it easier for admirals to farm specific nodes or to clear quests.

The following tags are used in this map:

{{ToolTip|{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag6}}|'''Force Z'''|line=false}}{{ToolTip|{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag4}}|'''Force H'''|line=false}}{{ToolTip|{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag5}}|'''10th Submarine Fleet'''|line=false}} {{ToolTip|{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag7}}|'''Force X'''|line=false}}

<span style="color:red";>'''Warning:'''</span> Ships tagged with {{ToolTip|'''Force H'''|{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag4}}}} will force a certain routing, effectively preventing their use in Phase 3 & 4. <span style="color:red">'''This applies on all difficulties and also applies post-clear.'''</span>

==Phase 1: Defeat the Abyssal Mediterranean Princess==
[[File:Summer2021E-3MapP1.png|450px|right]]
The boss is a combined fleet located at node {{MapRoute|I|red}}
* This phase uses a '''Single Fleet/Strike Force'''.
* There is air resistance en route to the boss, but the boss itself has no air power.
* The LBAS range to the boss is 6.
* ASW gear should be ignored in favor of using the Vanguard formation to evade the enemy submarines.
* Clearing this phase will automatically unlock the 2nd starting point.

This phase uses the following tag:

{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag6}}

Keep in mind that {{ToolTip|'''Force Z'''|{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag6}}}} is also featured in Phase 4, so plan accordingly.

<tabber>
|-|Option 1=
Composition: '''1CL 5DD 1XX Fast'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|1||A|blue|B|red|B2|pink|C2|blue|E|red|I|red}}
* Guarantees the shortest route, but may not be able to defeat the boss.
* Consistent for chipping, but a heavier fleet is desired during Last Dance.

|-|Option 2=
Composition: '''2CV(B) 2CVL 1CL 2DD'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|1||A|blue|B|red|B1|pink|C1|red|E|red|I|red}}
* A heavier fleet at the cost of having to fight one more battle at {{MapRoute|C1|red}}
* Carriers can make use of the historical bonuses provided by foreign bombers to kill the boss.
</tabber>

==Phase 2: Defeat the European Princess==
[[File:Summer2021E-3MapP2.png|450px|right]]
The boss is a combined fleet located at node {{MapRoute|O|red}}
* This phase uses a '''Combined Fleet'''.
* The LBAS range to the boss at {{MapRoute|O|red}} is 5.
* Node {{MapRoute|J2|red}} features the highly dangerous '''New Submarine Princess'''.
** Bringing 2 OASW capable ships and/or a LBAS full of ASW aircraft in order to neutralize her is recommended in order to minimize early retreats.
** The LBAS range for node {{MapRoute|J2|red}} is 1.
* Node {{MapRoute|M|red}} features '''Heavy Cruiser Ne-Class''' that are capable of firing opening torpedoes on '''Hard'''.
** The formation of this node will be locked at Line Ahead during Last Dance.
** People are encouraged to either use [[Repair Team]] or [[Repair Goddess]] as part of the strategy. Implementing kuso strategies is also possible. There is simply no good method around this.

This phase uses the following tag:

{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag4}}

<span style="color:red";>'''Warning:'''</span> Any '''Combined Fleet''' containing a ship tagged with {{ToolTip|'''Force H'''|{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag4}}}} will be forced to start at point 2, <span style="color:red";>'''regardless of difficulty'''</span>. This effectively means that any ships tagged with {{ToolTip|'''Force H'''|{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag4}}}} cannot be used for phases that involves either {{ToolTip|'''Force Z'''|{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag6}}}} or {{ToolTip|'''Force X'''|{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag7}}}}.

<tabber>
|-|Carrier Task Force=
Composition: '''4CV(B) 1CAV 1SS(V) + 1CL 2DD 1CA 1FBB 1XX ~Fast~'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|2||J2|red|L|pink|M|red|O|red}}
* '''XX''' should either be '''FBB''', '''CVL''', '''CAV''' or '''CLT'''.
* Just like Phase 1, carriers can make use of historical bonuses provided by foreign aircraft in order to deal as much damage as possible during daytime.
** This is important because carriers with the necessary aircraft are capable of defeating the boss at daytime. There are not that many ships capable of dealing decent damage during the night, assuming that the escort fleet is still alive at that point.
* The submarine can help tank some of the incoming shots and improve the survival of the main fleet.


|-|Surface Task Force=
Composition: '''4(F)BB(V) 1CV(B) 1XX + 1CL 2DD 1CVL 2CA(V) ~Fast~'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|2||J2|red|L|pink|M|red|O|red}}
* '''XX''' should either be '''SS(V)''' or '''CA(V)'''.
* An alternative option that doesn't capitalize on the use of historical aircraft, but chooses to conserve bauxite instead.
* Due to the lack of air power, air sweeping the boss to get a favorable air state is recommended.
* Among the fast battleships, only {{ShipLink|Bismarck}} and {{ShipLink|Richelieu}} have a decent historical bonus. Using STF on Hard might not be desirable due to the lack of historical bonuses.


|-|Kuso strategy=
<span style="color:red";>'''Warning:'''</span> Friendly ships will be sunk intentionally using this strategy.
* This is done by putting fodder destroyers that were intended for modernization/scrapping in the '''escort''' in order to tank all the torpedo attacks.
* This strategy is not meant for players who do not want to sink ships for whatever moral reasons.

===Option 1: Surface Task Force===
Composition: '''3(F)BB(V) 1CV(B) 2XX + 1CL 5DD fodders'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|2||J2|red|L|pink|M|red|O|red}}
* '''XX''' cannot be (F)BB(V) or CV(L/B).
* Damage output from the fleet is limited. Instead, the main source of damage comes boss support and LBAS.
* This option is purely intended for chipping, so it is very unlikely that a clear will occur on harder difficulties.

===Option 2: Carrier Task Force===
Composition: '''4CV(B) 2XX + 1CL 5DD fodders ~Fast~'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|2||J2|red|L|pink|M|red|O|red}}
* '''XX''' can be anything, but ships that can contribute to air power is recommended.
* Similarly to option 1, but with the huge difference that this is actually capable of killing the boss.
* The effectiveness of this strategy heavily depends on the amount of historical aircraft available.
** This also means that using carriers isn't feasible if the player lacks the historical aircraft.
* This is the recommended strategy in order to defeat the boss if the player has the required aircraft. Using a traditional fleet is simply not as effective on '''Hard'''.
</tabber>

==Phase 2.5A: Unlock the 3rd starting point==
[[File:Summer2021E-3MapP2.png|450px|right]]
After defeating the European Princess, the 3rd starting point needs to be unlocked in order to continue.
* To unlock the 3rd starting point, it is necessary to meet the requirements as listed below in the table.

All unlock requirements during this phase uses the following tag:

{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag6}}

<tabber>
|-|Node F=
Node {{MapRoute|F|red}} features enemy installations and PT-imps.
* Regardless of difficulty, only an A-rank is required to meet this requirement.
* The LBAS range to node {{MapRoute|F|red}} is 5.
* Capitalize on the enemy weaknesses by bringing anti-installation and [[Accuracy,_Evasion_and_Criticals#PT_Imps|anti-PT Imps]] equipment.
* The fleets used to clear node {{MapRoute|F|red}} can also be used to clear node {{MapRoute|G|red}}


===Option 1===
Composition: '''1CV(B) 1CL 5DD Fast'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|1||A|blue|B|red|B2|pink|C2|blue|F|red}}
* Guarantees the shortest route to the boss.
* With the right equipment, this fleet should be sufficient for an A-rank.

===Option 2===
Composition: '''1(F)BB(V) 2CV(B) 1CA(V) 1CL 2DD'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|1||A|blue|B|red|B1|pink|C1|red|C2|blue|F|red}}
* A slightly heavier fleet that allows you to use more capital ships, at the cost of having to fight an extra battle at {{MapRoute|C1|red}}

|-|Node G=
Node {{MapRoute|G|red}} mainly consists of enemy destroyers, light cruisers and transport ships.
* Getting an S-rank on node {{MapRoute|G|red}} should not be a problem for any decently equipped fleet.
* The LBAS range to node {{MapRoute|G|red}} is 6
** The enemies at node {{MapRoute|G|red}} are weak, thus it is recommended to use the LBAS for other purposes instead, like LBAS defense.

===Option 1===
Composition: '''1CV(B) 1CL 5DD Fast'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|1||A|blue|B|red|B2|pink|C2|blue|E|red|G|red}}
* LoS Cn2 ≤ 40.
* Guarantees the shortest route to the boss, but it is required to '''FAIL''' the LoS check at node {{MapRoute|E|red}}.

===Option 2===
Composition: '''1(F)BB(V) 2CV(B) 1CA(V) 1CL 2DD'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|1||A|blue|B|red|B1|pink|C1|red|C2|blue|E|red|G|red}}
* A slightly heavier fleet that allows you to use more capital ships, at the cost of having to fight an extra battle at {{MapRoute|C1|red}}
* Similar to option 1, it is required to '''FAIL''' the LoS check at node {{MapRoute|E|red}}.

===Option 3===
Composition: '''1(F)BB(V) 2CV(B) 1CA(V)/CVL 2DD Fast'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|1||A|blue|B|red|B1|pink|C1|red|C2|blue|E|red|G|red}}
* A variant of option 2 that uses a Single Fleet instead.
* With the absence of a CL, it is no longer necessary to resort to failing the LoS at node {{MapRoute|E|red}} in order to route to {{MapRoute|G|red}}
</tabber>

==Phase 2.5B: Find the New Mediterranean Dreadnought Water Princess==
[[File:Summer2021E-3MapP2-5.png|450px|right]]
The boss is still missing after unlocking the 3rd starting point. More steps are required in order to reveal node {{MapRoute|Z2|red}}.
* This step is lenghtier than the previous step and involves the use of multiple shiplock tags.
* <span style="color:red";>'''Warning:'''</span> Do not use {{ToolTip|'''Force H'''|{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag4}}}} tagged ships in '''Combined Fleets''', as that will force the fleet to start at point 2.
** The results can be inconvenient due to more ships being tagged with {{ToolTip|'''Force H'''|{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag4}}}}.

This phase uses the following tags:

{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag6}}{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag5}}{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag7}}

<span style="color:red";>'''Note'''</span>: Only ships tagged with {{ToolTip|'''Force Z'''|{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag6}}}} can be used for the final phase on '''Hard'''.

|-|Node B2=
{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag6}}<br />
Composition: '''1CV(L/B) 1CL 5DD Fast'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|1||A|blue|B|red|B2|pink}}
* All CL and DDs are to be equipped with ASW equipment, as this route only features submarines.
* The CV(L/B) should only be equipped with fighters.
* The LBAS range to node {{MapRoute|B2|pink}} is 3.
* Due to the strict requirements of the routing, it might be desirable to air sweep node {{MapRoute|B2|pink}} in order to further lower the required air power.

|-|Nodes T1 and T2=
{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag5}}<br />
Node {{MapRoute|T1|red}} features enemy destroyers, light cruisers and transport ships.
* While node {{MapRoute|T1|red}} should be trivial for any decent fleet, getting there might be hard due to the strict requirements.
* Admirals who do not have a Submarine Tender (AS) will have to resort to random routing in order to reach {{MapRoute|T1|red}}
* The LBAS range to node {{MapRoute|T1|red}} is 9.

===Option 1===
Composition: '''1AS 1CL 2CVL 3SS(V)'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|3||Q|blue|S|pink|T2|red|T1|red}}
* Guarantees routing to {{MapRoute|T1|red}}

===Option 2===
Composition: '''6SS(V)'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|3||Q|blue|S|pink|T2|red|T1|red}}
* <span style="color:red";>'''Random routing'''</span> at nodes {{MapRoute|S|red}} and {{MapRoute|T2|red}}
* This option is reserved for admirals without Submarine Tenders.

|-|Nodes T2, T3 and T4=
{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag5}}<br />
Node {{MapRoute|T4|red}} is a surface battle involving an enemy carrier.
* Admirals who do not have a Submarine Tender (AS) will have to resort to random routing in order to reach {{MapRoute|T4|red}}
* The LBAS range to nodes {{MapRoute|T3|red}} and {{MapRoute|T4|red}} is 10.

===Option 1===
Composition: '''1AS 2CVL 3SS(V)'''
* Routes:
** {{MapRoute|3||Q|blue|S|pink|T3|red|T4|red}}
** {{MapRoute|3||Q|blue|S|pink|T2|red|T3|red|T4|red}}
* Guarantees routing to {{MapRoute|T4|red}}, but the route it takes is random.

===Option 2===
Composition: '''6SS(V)'''
* Routes:
** {{MapRoute|3||Q|blue|S|pink|T3|red|T4|red}}
** {{MapRoute|3||Q|blue|S|pink|T2|red|T3|red|T4|red}}
* <span style="color:red";>'''Random routing'''</span> at nodes {{MapRoute|S|red}} and {{MapRoute|T2|red}}
* This option is reserved for admirals without Submarine Tenders.

|-|Nodes P,U,W and X=
{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag7}}<br />
Nodes {{MapRoute|P|pink|U|purple|W|red|X|red}} can all be reached using the same fleet.
* Any ships used in this phase will be tagged with {{ToolTip|'''Force X'''|{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag7}}}}
** The '''Combined Fleet''' used for this phase will also be used to clear Phase 3.
** Keep in mind that on '''Hard''', you cannot use any ships tagged with {{ToolTip|'''Force X'''|{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag7}}}} for the final boss of this map.
** Avoid bringing {{ShipLink|Akitsushima Kai}} on '''Hard''', as she will be useful for routing purposes during the final phase.
* Node {{MapRoute|R|red}} features the highly dangerous '''New Submarine Princess'''.
** Bringing 2 OASW capable ships and/or a LBAS full of ASW aircraft in order to neutralize her is recommended in order to minimize early retreats.
* Regardless of the chosen fleet, the fleet will always go through nodes {{MapRoute|P|pink}} and {{MapRoute|U|purple}}
** A node support fleet is recommended in order to improve the passing rate of node {{MapRoute|U|purple}}
* Node {{MapRoute|W|red}} features enemy installations and PT imps.
** The LBAS range for this node is 7.
** Only an A-rank is sufficient, regardless of difficulty.
** Keep in mind of the combat flow in a '''Combined Fleet vs Combined Fleet'''. The escort fleet will never attack the enemy main fleet during daytime.
* Node {{MapRoute|X|red}} is a straightforward surface battle featuring multiple Re-class battleships.
** The LBAS range for this node is 9.

===Surface Task Force===
Composition: '''2(F)BB(V) 2CVL 2CA(V)/AV + 1CL 3DD 2XX'''
* Routes:
** {{MapRoute|3||P|pink|R|red|U|purple|V|blue|W|red}}
** {{MapRoute|3||P|pink|R|red|U|purple|V|blue|X|red}}
* XX should either be CA(V), CLT or up to 1 SS(V).
* An all purpose STF that can be outfitted depending on what is required.

===Carrier Task Force===
Composition: '''3CV(L/B) 1(F)BB(V) 2XX + 1CL 3DD 2XX'''
* Routes:
** {{MapRoute|3||P|pink|R|red|U|purple|V|blue|W|red}}
** {{MapRoute|3||P|pink|R|red|U|purple|V|blue|X|red}}
* XX can't be a (F)BB(V) or CV(L/B).
* The use of CTF allows for more air power, but they are also in a disadvantage when fighting enemy single fleets.
** Unlike STF, the escort fleet attacks first in a CTF. This can be a problem at node {{MapRoute|X|red}}
</tabber>

==Phase 3: Clear the TP Phase==
[[File:Summer2021E-3MapP3.png|450px|right]]
Now that node {{MapRoute|Z2|red}} is unlocked, it is time to clear the TP phase.
* This phase uses a '''Combined Fleet'''. The same fleets used in Phase 2.5B can be used to clear this phase.
* The LBAS range to node {{MapRoute|Z2|red}} is 11.
* The trip to the boss is filled with dangers including a night battle at node {{MapRoute|U|purple}}, the '''New Submarine Princess''' at node {{MapRoute|R|red}} and Re-class battleships at node {{MapRoute|X|red}}
** Due to all the dangers, using a Fleet Command Facility is highly recommended.
** Using node support can improve the pass rate at {{MapRoute|U|purple}}
* The boss is very difficult to defeat on '''Hard'''. Expect the majority of the runs to end with A-ranks.

This phase uses the following tag:

{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag7}}

<tabber>
|-|Surface Task Force=
Composition: '''2(F)BB(V) 2CVL 2CA(V)/AV + 1CL 3DD 2XX'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|3||P|pink|R|red|U|purple|V|blue|X|red|Y|pink|Z|green|Z2|red}}
* XX should either be CA(V), CLT or up to 1 SS(V).
* An all purpose STF that can be outfitted depending on what is required.

|-|Carrier Task Force=
Composition: '''3CV(L/B) 1(F)BB(V) or CV(L/B) 2XX + 1CL 3DD 2XX'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|3||P|pink|R|red|U|purple|V|blue|X|red|Y|pink|Z|green|Z2|red}}
* XX can't be a (F)BB(V) or CV(L/B).
* A carrier fleet that fully makes use of the historical bonuses that are provided by foreign aircraft in order deal high amount of damage during daytime.
* The use of CTF allows for more air power, but they are also in a disadvantage when fighting the fleet at {{MapRoute|X|red}}
** This issue more relevant now that node {{MapRoute|X|red}} is not the final destination. Keep in mind that a STF does not suffer from this problem.
* This option is heavily reliant on foreign aircraft that provides the relevant bonuses. This option is thus not recommended if the player lacks the aircraft to outfit multiple carriers with the historical bonuses.
</tabber>

==Phase 4: Defeat the European Armored Carrier Princess==
[[File:Summer2021E-3MapP4.png|450px|right]]
Once the TP phase is cleared, the boss at node {{MapRoute|Z3|red}} will automatically be unlocked.
* Once LD is reached, head over to Phase 4.5 to further debuff the boss.
* Upon reaching Phase 4, the following shiplock tagging rules are in effect:
** STF/CTF will now be tagged with {{ToolTip|'''Force Z'''|{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag6}}}}. This means that ships tagged with {{ToolTip|'''Force X'''|{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag7}}}} are now unusable in this phase.
*** As shiplock tags are only enforced on '''Hard''', admirals on lower difficulties can disregard this.
** <span style="color:red";>'''Warning'''</span>: As usual, '''Combined Fleets''' that contains {{ToolTip|'''Force H'''|{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag4}}}} tagged ships will be forced to starting point 2, '''regardless of difficulty'''.
* The LBAS is relocated to the eastern portion of the map. This will change the LBAS range of all nodes.
* The LBAS range for the boss at node {{MapRoute|Z3|red}} is 1.
* As the routing barely changes, the strategy largely remains the same as in Phase 3.
** Use OASW/ASW aircraft to deal with the '''New Submarine Princess''' at {{MapRoute|R|red}}
** Using Fleet Command Facility is encouraged for chipping the boss.
** A repair node is now available at node {{MapRoute|X1|blue}}
** Using {{ShipLink|Nelson}} in STF is recommended for her touch attack.
** CTF is potentially more potent than STF, but it is also more heavier on bauxite.

This phase uses the following tag:

{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag6}}

|-|Surface Task Force=
===Option 1===
Composition: '''3(F)BB(V) 1CV(B) 1CA(V) 1 Akitsushima Kai + 1CL 2-3DD 2-3XX'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|3||P|pink|R|red|S|pink|U|purple|V|blue|X|red|X1|blue|X2|blue|Z3|red}}
* XX should either be CLT, up to 1 SS(V) or up to 1 CA(V).
* Having {{ShipLink|Akitsushima Kai}} skips an additional air node while allowing repairs if damage was sustained.

===Option 2===
Composition: '''4(F)BB(V) 2CVL + 1CL 2-3DD 2-3XX'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|3||P|pink|R|red|S|pink|U|purple|V|blue|X|red|Y|pink|Z3|red}}
* XX should either be CA(V), CLT or up to 1 SS(V).
* This fleet does not rely on {{ShipLink|Akitsushima Kai}}.
** This fleet will go through an extra air node, but in return, a heavier fleet can be used against the boss.

|-|Carrier Task Force=
===Option 1===
Composition: '''3CV(B) 1CVL 2XX + 1CL 3DD 2XX Fast'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|3||P|pink|R|red|S|pink|U|purple|V|blue|X|red|Z3|red}}
* XX can't be a (F)BB(V) or CV(L/B).
* A carrier fleet that fully makes use of the historical bonuses that are provided by foreign aircraft in order deal high amount of damage during daytime.
* The use of CTF allows for more air power, but they are also in a disadvantage when fighting the fleet at {{MapRoute|X|red}}
** This issue more relevant now that node {{MapRoute|X|red}} is not the final destination. Keep in mind that a STF does not suffer from this problem.
* This option is heavily reliant on foreign aircraft that provides the relevant bonuses. This option is thus not recommended if the player lacks the aircraft to outfit multiple carriers with the historical bonuses.

===Option 2===
Composition: '''3CV(B) 1CVL 2XX + 1CL 3DD 2FBB Fast'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|3||P|pink|R|red|S|pink|U|purple|V|blue|X|red|Y|pink|Z3|red}}
* Similar to option 1, but now better equipped to deal with node X at the cost of going through an extra air node.
* This option is heavily reliant on foreign aircraft that provides the relevant bonuses. This option is thus not recommended if the player lacks the aircraft to outfit multiple carriers with the historical bonuses.
</tabber>

==Phase 4.5: Debuff the boss and finish her off==
[[File:Summer2021E-3MapP4.png|450px|right]]
Once LD is reached against the European Armored Carrier Princess, it is now possible to start debuffing the boss.
* All steps can be done with {{ToolTip|'''Force Z'''|{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag6}}}} tagged ships.

|-|Node I=
===Option 1===
Composition: '''1CL 5DD 1XX Fast'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|1||A|blue|B|red|B2|pink|C2|blue|E|red|I|red}}
* Guarantees the shortest route and should be sufficient for an A-rank.

===Option 2===
Composition: '''1(F)BB(V) 2CV(B) 1CVL 1CL 2DD'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|1||A|blue|B|red|B1|pink|C1|red|E|red|I|red}}
* A heavier fleet at the cost of having to fight one more battle at {{MapRoute|C1|red}}
* Carriers can make use of the historical bonuses provided by foreign bombers to kill the boss.


|-|Node T=
===Carrier Task Force===
Composition: '''4CV(L/B) 1(F)BB(V) 1XX + 1CL 2DD 3XX
* Route: {{MapRoute|3||P|pink|R|red|S|pink|T|pink}}
* XX can be anything inside the rules of a '''Carrier Task Force''' formation.

===Surface Task Force===
Composition: '''2CA(V) 2CVL 2XX + 1CL 2DD 3XX
* Route: {{MapRoute|3||P|pink|R|red|S|pink|T|pink}}
* XX should be anything that can contribute to the air power, like AV, CAV and BBV.
* Albeit difficult without the use of LBAS, it is not impossible to clear node {{MapRoute|T|pink}} using a STF instead.

|-|Nodes X, Y and Z2=
===Surface Task Force===
Composition: '''4(F)BB(V) 1CVL 1CVL or {{ShipLink|Akitsushima Kai}} + 1CL 2-3DD 2-3XX'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|3||P|pink|R|red|S|pink|U|purple|V|blue|X|red|Y|pink|Z|blue|Z2|red}}
* XX should either be CA(V), CLT or up to 1 SS(V).
* Equip at least 3 Drum Canisters. It is not required to equip drums across 3 ships.
* Equip enough fighters on the carriers to ensure AS is achieved on node Y.
