An improved variant of the "dive bombing-capable torpedo bomber", the Ryuusei. Not only does the Ryuusei Kai have an exquisite silhouette, but it is a heavily armed, multi-role carrier attack plane that has hydraulically-operated bomb bay doors, landing gear, and flaps; 2x20mm cannons; and a rear-mounted, 13mm swivel gun. It is crewed by the skilled members of the elite what-if torpedo bomber squadron that was to be deployed on Akagi and Kaga.
