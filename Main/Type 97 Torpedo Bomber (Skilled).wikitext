==Introduction==
熟練搭乗員で構成された「九七艦攻」装備の艦攻隊です。<br>速度や防弾装備は劣るものの優れた航続距離と熟練搭乗員の腕で、緒戦の機動部隊と共に大活躍を演じました。雷撃・水平爆撃をこなす主力艦上攻撃機ですが、徐々に現役を退いていきます。

''This particular Type 97 torpedo bomber was used by skilled aircrews. While slow and unarmored, it had great operational range and in the hands of skilled aircrews, played an important role in the Carrier Task Force during the breakout of hostilities. Capable of torpedo runs and horizontal bombing against enemy ships, it was gradually phased out in favor of newer aircraft.''
