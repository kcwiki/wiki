==Introduction==
島嶼への上陸作戦のために開発された水陸両用「特二式内火艇」、通称「カミ車」です。
前後に着脱式のフロートを備え、機甲戦力として敵地への上陸作戦が可能です。
輸送時の水密化構造が採用されており、潜水艦での運用も可能でした。

An amphibious vehicle developed for landing operations around islands, the 'Special Type 2 Launch', also known as the 'Ka-Mi Tank'.
Equipped with removable floats at the front and back, it allowed landing operations to have armoured support.
With watertight construction, it can also be deployed aboard submarines.

==Notes==
*'''Unbuildable.'''
*Constructable via [[Akashi's Improvement Arsenal]] by maxing out and upgrading a [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tanks & Marines)]]
*Increases expedition resources gain by 1% for each equipped Amphibious Tank, up to 20%. Increase is multiplicative with bonus from Great Success.
*{{PAGENAME}} slightly increases TP gauge drain during [[Transport Operation#Equipment TP Value|Transport Operations]]
*Equipping these tanks with a unit that uses a Daihatsu unit or a WG42 will confer a firepower bonus against enemy installations where amphibious landing operations apply (I.E 6-4)
*Arming a Submarine with a Type 2 Ka-Mi tank will allow the submarine to participate in the shelling phase of battle by launching the tank in battle when target an installation type enemy during amphibious landing operations.
*Quest reward from [[Quests#F33|F33]].
