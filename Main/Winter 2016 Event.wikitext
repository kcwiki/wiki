==Introduction==
The Winter 2016 Event '''Sortie! Operation Rei-Go''' is planned to start on February 10th, 2016 at 1900 JST. The event will be based off of '''Operation Rei-Go''', a one day battle that took place along '''Mindoro Island''' where the IJN counterattacked US forces staging a landing on December 26th, 1944. 

The Event is composed of only three maps, and allows for difficulty selection like in previous events. The Hard difficulty will be more difficult compared to usual event maps.

The first two stages will be themed on Operation Rei-Go and the Final Stage will be an Extra Operation, a "What If" scenario focusing on an Interception Mission.

In addition, it will feature battles against land based air units and a new gimmick system in E-3 that will be different from the usual armor reduction gimmick.

It's also been noted that for the first two maps, fleet requirements will be flexible; this will vary depending on the difficulty setting.

Currently, 3 new ships are slated to appear as part of the event. The ships we are aware of so far are:

* Destroyer [[Hatsuzuki]]
* Destroyer [[Okinami]]
* Heavy Cruiser [[Zara]]

*In addition, a series of tweets confirmed that ships from past events will appear as drops, most likely [[Graf Zeppelin]], [[Mizuho]], [[Akitsushima]], and [[Amagi]].

===New Equipment===

*[[Zara]] comes with two new pieces of equipment:
** The [[Ro.43 Recon Seaplane]]
** The [[203mm / 53 Twin Gun Mount]]

*The [[Supply Depot Princess]] is the E-2 boss.
*The [[Heavy Cruiser Princess]] is the E-3 boss.

==Mechanics==
===Participation requirements===
*Must have a 75% sortie win ratio.
*Must have 5 empty ship slots for new ships.
*Must have 20 free equipment slots.

===Special Mechanics===
# The difficulty system first used in [[Spring 2015 Event]] returns: you can choose between Operation A ({{lang|ja|甲}}, Hard), Operation B ({{lang|ja|乙}}, Medium) or Operation C ({{lang|ja|丙}}, Easy).
#* Choosing A or B requires certain HQ Level (HQ Lv 35 for B / 80 for A in Spring 2015 Event).
#It's been noted that the Extra Operation will involve a use a new gimmick that will not be related to the armor reduction gimmick.
#There does not appear to be any shiplocking this event.

*''Recommended fleet compositions:'' 
**1 BBV plus 4DD/CL plus either CVL/CL
**4-slots cruisers ([[Ooyodo]], [[Yuubari]], [[Katori]], [[Kashima]]) are highly recommended.
*You can use [[Kasumi]] as flagship to take the northeast route. 
**Note that node G and H are air raids: It is a single air battle phase, but you will not be able to inflict any damage. At these nodes, damage taken determines the victory rank (it is not an automatic loss). You will not be able to enter night battle at these nodes either.

*[[Umikaze]] does not drop on Easy.
*''Recommended fleet compositions:'' 
**North, AEIJMO: Rei-Go Fleet ([[Kasumi]], [[Kiyoshimo]], [[Asashimo]], [[Ashigara]]) + 2 CAV.
**3 DD, 1 CL, 1CLT, 1 CA goes to the North Route even without Rei-Go ships but has less firepower.
*There are two different routes you can take depending on your fleet.
**North Route cannot have CVs or BBs or else you will start at south.
*[[Supply Depot Princess]] is an installation type boss, so Type 3 Shells and WG42 are highly recommended.
*The southern route allows for much more firepower, and more type 3 shells.
** 4BB 2CV or 2BB 2CA 2CV allows for maximum firepower, but takes a very roundabout route (CDGKLMO).
** 1fBB 2CA(v) 2DD 1CV allows for the much shorter CGKN route. AACI is recommended for one of the DDs since Type 3 Shells is needed for the CAs and BBs
*Nodes D and K in South Route and Nodes F, H, and I in North Route are Single Aerial battles. Consider using Diamond formation or bring an AACI setup.

'''Transport Phase'''
*''Recommended fleet compositions:''  
** Transport Fleet: 2BBV and 4DD (1st Fleet) and 1CL (Abukuma Kai Ni preferred), 2CA(V), and 3DD (2nd Fleet)
***While this will take you to the Airfield Hime node, this in turn will give your fleet a better chance at S-ranking to boss node to maximize the TP gained upon completing the run.
*DD in the first fleet should be fully equipped with [[Drum Canister|drums]]. Abukuma and Kasumi at Kai Ni can use 1-2 [[Daihatsu]]. If you use a CAV consider bringing 1 drum for them. Everyone else needs to be armed to battle.
*Transport Boss is the Destroyer Princess
*Set up mentioned above should easily make short work of the enemy fleet with little issue.

'''Battle Phase'''
*''Recommended fleet compositions:''  
** Surface Task Force: 4BB and 2 CVL (1st Fleet) and  1CL (Abukuma Kai Ni preferred), 2-3 CLT, 0-1 FBB, 2DD (2nd Fleet).
***Fleet has the option to go east or south at first intersection. It's recommended to go south as it is easier to reach the boss node and you will do so with more fuel. The east route will have you fight So-class submarines who are very dangerous to your escort fleet.
*Heavy Cruiser Princess will always have a pair of Battleship Princesses with her. However the Aircraft Carrier Princess will occasionally be replaced by Tsu-Class Elite (on Hard mode).
*Boss Fleet Support is highly recommended
**In-Route Support is recommended if you have trouble making your way on the final kill.
