=Night Battle Breakdown=

[[File:Pursue_Nightbattle.png|thumb|right|The screen after Day Battle. Clicking "夜戦突入" on the right will begin Night Battle]]
If your fleet pursues the enemy into Night Battle (夜戦, ''yasen''), or you enter a special Node such as a '''Night Node''' or a '''Night to Day Node''', your fleet will fight at night.

The Night Battle has the following structure:
* Night Contact and Spotting
* Night Shelling Phase

Other phases that may happen before '''Night Shelling Phase''':
* Support Expedition (if the battle starts at night)
* [[Friend Fleet|Allied Friendly Fleet Phase]]

In case neither fleets meet the requirements, the sub-phase will be skipped.

=Night Contact and Spotting=
[[File:Nightbattle_Gear_Trigger.png|thumb|right|Star Shell, Searchlight and Night Recon activated. The Night Recon is displayed on top of the Enemy "Radar".]]
When the fleet is equipped with certain equipment, additional effects are triggered for the duration of the Night Battle. The equipment that influence the battle in such ways are [[Searchlight]], [[Type 96 150cm Searchlight|Large Searchlight]], [[Star Shell]] and [[Type 98 Recon_Seaplane (Night_Scout)|Night Scout]].

More information on the actual effects of each piece of equipment can be found in the Night Shelling 
Special Attacks section.

|}

=Night Shelling Phase=
Following the battle preliminary stages, Night Shelling proper will begin. Similar to Day Battle, attacks performed by ships are shelling attacks.

Some rules are applied to shelling attacks:
* Attack power is defined by {{Firepower}} + {{Torpedo}} stats instead of only {{Firepower}}.
** If the enemy is unaffected by torpedoes, such as installations, only {{Firepower}} is used instead.
* <span style="color:red;">'''Heavily damaged {{Nihongo|(大破)|''Taiha''}}'''</span> and sunk ships are unable to participate in battle.
* All types of Aircraft Carriers are unable to participate in battle, unless they are equipped with a {{AviationPersonnel}}{{EquipmentLink|Night Operation Aviation Personnel}}.
** [[Saratoga|Saratoga Mk.II]], [[Akagi|Akagi Kai Ni E]] and [[Kaga|Kaga Kai Ni E]] have built-in Night Operation capabilities and do not require such equipment.
** [[Saratoga]], [[Ark Royal]], [[Graf Zeppelin]], [[Taiyou]] and [[Shinyou]] can perform Surface shelling attacks without any equipment. These attacks can be performed even if Moderately Damaged.
* Shelling attacks that target submarines will always deal 0 damage, and default to '''scratch damage'''. This makes it not possible to sink a submarine during Night Battle.
** This rule is void if the player fleet is a '''Combined Fleet'''.
* Ships with 0 {{Firepower}} + {{Torpedo}} stats are unable to participate in battle.
** Currently, this is only observable against the Wa-Class Transport Ship.

[[File:Nightbattle_Order.png|thumb|right|Example of engagement order during Night Battle]]
The firing order is defined when the Night Shelling Phase starts, and in contrast to Day Battle, will not skip over sunk and retreated ships, or ships that have no means of attacking under any circumstances, such as a carrier with no bombers equipped or a Wa-Class Transport Ship, for example. In such cases, the ship will perform an actionless turn instead.

In addition to that, Night Battle is not affected by the Day Battle's Engagement form.

=Night Special Attacks=

Using special equipment setups, ships may perform one of multiple special attacks at night. These attacks are often referred to as '''Cut-ins''' due to the way the equipment is displayed in the screen before the attacks are performed. Particular Cut-ins are often referred to by their acronym, such as TCI for Torpedo Cut-in, GCI for Gun Cut-in, etc.

Compared to its Day Battle counterpart ''Artillery Spotting'', Cut-ins require no special conditions such as Air State, relying solely on the equipment restrictions and the stats of the ship performing it. Do note that the specific equipment being shown during the Cut-ins have no influence on the damage output.

Cut-ins may be activated during a ship's turn and will override its normal single attack.

==Setups and Attack Types==

Different setups have different conditions, trigger rates, damage, and number of hits. Cut-ins are solely determined by the attack's prerequisites.

For a given Cut-in, any other equipment can be added on the remaining slots. Be wary that adding certain equipment may change the Cut-in you would be rolling for.
If your setup fulfils multiple prerequisites, the Cut-in ''closer to the bottom of the list'' will be used. Additionally, each ship will roll for '''"New Type"''' Cut-ins first, if possible.

* {{RedGunHeavy}}{{RedGunLight}} is used to indicate a '''Main Gun'''.
* {{YellowGun}}{{GreenGunDP}} is used to indicate a '''Secondary Gun'''.
** Note that small caliber {{GreenGunDP}} such as {{EquipmentLink|10cm Twin High-angle Gun Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director|text=10cm Twin High-angle Gun + AAFD}} and {{EquipmentLink|5inch Single Gun Mount Mk.30|text=5in Single Gun Mk.30}}, as well as Atlanta's {{EquipmentLink|5inch Twin Dual-purpose Gun Mount (Concentrated Deployment)|text=5in Twin Dual-purpose Gun Mount (CD)}} are not Secondary but Main Guns.
* {{TorpedoWeapon}} is used to indicate a '''Torpedo'''.
** Note that Minisubs such as {{EquipmentLink|Type A Kouhyouteki}} are not Torpedoes.
* Special custom icons were used for Carrier Cut-ins for clarity's sake.
** {{AnyBomber}} is used to indicate either a '''{{BluePlane}}{{EquipmentLink|Swordfish|Swordfish Mk.II (Skilled)|Swordfish Mk.III (Skilled)|text=Swordfish|size=150px}}''' or '''{{DiveBomb icon}}{{EquipmentLink|Zero Fighter Model 62 (Fighter-bomber / Iwai Squadron)|link=Zero Fighter Type 62 (Fighter-bomber/Iwai_Squadron)|text=Iwai F/B}}'''.
** {{NightFighterEn}} is used to indicate a '''{{PurpleFighter}}Night Fighter'''.
** {{NightBomberEn}} is used to indicate a '''{{PurpleBomber}}Night Torpedo Bomber'''.
** {{NightDivebomberEn}} is used to indicate '''{{DiveBomb icon}}{{EquipmentLink|Suisei Model 12 (w/ Type 31 Photoelectric Fuze Bombs)}}''' (AKA '''"Photobomber"''').

==="New Type" Cut-ins===
[[File:Night_Attack_Example.png|thumb|right|Uranami performing a DD-exclusive Torpedo/RADAR/Lookout Cut-in, or TRL for short.]]
The "New Type" Cut-ins are the Cut-ins introduced with the implementation of [[Saratoga|Saratoga Mk.II]] onwards. From bottom to top, each eligible Cut-in will be rolled if the previous roll has failed. If all rolls fail, then an additional single roll for a '''"Original Type"''' Cut-in is performed.

Do note that Carrier Cut-ins require Night Operation capabilities either passively (granted by a specific remodel) or granted by equipping a {{EquipmentLink|Night Operation Aviation Personnel}}. Carriers that can perform Surface Shelling attacks at night '''will not''' perform Carrier Cut-ins without said Night Operation capabilities.

If not applicable, ships will skip rolling for "New Type" Cut-ins altogether and only roll for Original Types instead.

* By using a second {{EquipmentLink|12.7cm Twin Gun Mount Model D Kai 2|text=12.7cm Model D Kai 2}} when performing a Destroyer Cut-in, an additional bonus of '''1.125x''' is applied multiplicatively to the attack. This setup can only be deployed on {{ShipLink|Tashkent/Kai}}.

===Original Cut-ins===

In contrast with the "New Type" Cut-ins, Original Cut-ins are only rolled once, even if multiple setup prerequisites are met. The setup used will be the bottom-most that meet the prerequisites. If this roll fails, the ship will perform a '''Single Attack'''.

===Single Attack===

If all rolls fail or the ship meets no Cut-in requirements, then it'll perform a Single Attack: a default 1 hit, no damage modifier attack.

==Trigger Rates==

The chance of successfully rolling a Cut-in and performing the attack is given by:

<math>\text{CI %} = \left[ \dfrac{\text{Base}_\text{ship}}{\text{Base}_\text{attack}} \right] \times 100</math>

Where:

<math>\text{Base}_\text{ship} = \lfloor 15 + \text{Luck} + 0.75 \times \sqrt{\text{Level}} + \text{Modifiers}\rfloor</math> , if the Ship's Luck stat is less than 50.

<math>\text{Base}_\text{ship} = \lfloor 65 + \sqrt{ \left( \text{Luck} - 50 \right) } + 0.8 \times \sqrt{\text{Level}} + \text{Modifiers}\rfloor</math> , if the Ship's Luck stat is 50 or greater.

'''Modifiers''' is the sum of various equipment modifiers. Do note that modifiers change based on the Cut-in that is being used:

'''Additional Notes:'''
* Due to the formula's parameters, the effect of {{Luck}} over 51 is negligible due to diminishing returns, thus going above such value is generally discouraged.
* The formula used above was datamined from KanColle Kai and is corroborated by test results in the Browser version.
