==Notes==
Battle Rations are a consumable item that, when an equipped ship drops to a certain level of [[morale]], will be consumed, resulting in a large boost in morale for the ship that 'eats' the Ration, while the ships 'besides' (the ones directly above and below in the combat screen) are given a small boost.
