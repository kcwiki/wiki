==Trivia==
*''Akebono'' means ''daybreak''.
* The flower on her head is the wild spring chrysanthemum, 都忘れ or ''Miyakowasure'', which in flower language means 'The sadness of parting,' 'A short moratorium,' & 'Until the day we meet again'.
*To begin with, Akebono doesn't really stand out favorably in history. Unlike her sister [[Ushio]], Akebono is taken as the 'ship of misfortune,' while Ushio is the 'ship of fortune.'

|1. ''Battle of the Coral Seas''<br />
Akebono was assigned to escort Zuikaku while Ushio was assigned to Shoukaku. In the middle of the mission, Ushio requested to switch with Akebono & Akebono agreed. However, American bombers heavily damaged Shoukaku yet Zuikaku got away without a single scratch. As a result, Ushio & Zuikaku were considered the lucky ships from this point on while Akebono & Shoukaku received the opposite. Similarly, rather than reprimanding Ushio, Akebono was reprimanded for Shoukaku's injuries. Akebono was then reassigned from the front lines to the rear.

This is reflected in [[#Quotes|Secretary(3)]] ''If you don't like me, why don't you just reassign me?''.


2. January 1944 Escort<br />
Akebono & her sister Sazanami were escorting a fleet of supply ships. Enroute, Sazanami was attacked by USS Albacore (SS-218) & sank on the spot. Akebono launched 59 depth charges & drove it away; however, the delayed rendezvous with the supply fleet left it with no protection. As such, it was virtually annihilated.

This is reflected in her [[#Quotes|Library Intro]], ''....But, I'm a bit uneasy around subs....'', as she not only lost her sister to them, but failed as an escort.


3. ''Battle of Leyte Gulf''<br />
Akebono was once again assigned with Ushio. When Mogami crashed into Nachi, Akebono went to escort Mogami; however, the American air wings did not let up & further damaged the half-sunken Mogami. In the end, Akebono was ordered to torpedo Mogami.


4. Manila Air Raids<br />
The Americans were determined to finish off Nachi. At that time, Akebono was ported with Nachi & was the only ship able to immediately defend. Unfortunately, while facing innumerable aircraft, Nachi sustained several heavy hits & sank.

Naturally, Akebono was heavily damaged as well & Ushio towed her into the dock for repairs. However a week later, the American launched another air strike. Akebono's cannons, engines, & torpedoes were all but destroyed. She sank while being observed by Ushio nearby.


Closing notes<br />
If Akebono & Ushio hadn't switched back then, her fate may have been different. However Akebono doesn't blame Ushio for all of this - she is more angry at her superiors, who blamed her inappropriately & overlooked the circumstances at the time. That's why she insists on 'Kuso Teitoku' - she has a profound distrust of superiors.
