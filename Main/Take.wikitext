===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low-ish'''
 
:A Japanese destroyer with firepower a bit below a [[Fubuki]]-class' first remodel, albeit with a much stronger ASW stat that allows her to perform OASW easily and free up other DDs for different tasks.
:Unlike her sister [[Matsu]], she has the second best Torpedo stat of all destroyers and a very good base Luck, so a night battle cut-in setup can be considered, although the damage could be higher.
:It is worth noting that she has significant bonuses when equipped with some torpedoes, which increases her night battle capabilities, although the extent of those synergies is suspect and might just be a bug.
:She's also cheap to run, which makes her a good fit for expeditions.

:No further remodels have been implemented for her yet (as of December 2020).

====Recommended Roles====
* Expeditions
* ASW
* Night battle
