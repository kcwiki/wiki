==Description==
Kantai Collection Kai (or KanColle Kai) was a offline Real-Time Strategy variation of the Kantai Browser game which was avalaible on the Playstation Vita, which once again, features the player taking the role of an admiral to maintain and take care of Kanmusu in order to battle against the mysterious enemy known as the Abyssal Fleet. Players would be able able to take control of multiple fleets as they attempted to try to regain control of the ocean waters around the various maps in the Pacific Ocean.

The game featured a turn based system where you control your fleet and all game related content was converted from time, to turns and all kanmusus in the naval base areas and on the menu screen were featured in 2D Live animations. The game also featured the entire kanmusus roster all the way up to kanmusus from the [[Fall 2015 Event]] and included one new Kanmusu which would be released as a sneak peak for the then upcoming [[Spring 2016 Event]], [[Iowa]].

Many of the maps featured reflected similarities to the original game and also featured other locations that would were inspired off from Event based locations within the game. As you slowly began to take control of the waters, you had to also make sure you could be able to stop enemy abyssal fleets from reclaiming the map which you gain controlled of. Failure to do this and having the Abyssal fleet end up taking control of the Naval Base Waters where your main base is located would result in a game over. The overall objective of the game was to gain complete control of the Pacific Ocean in which you would have to start with most of map that were also featured in the main part of the game, followed by maps inspired by the event, and then ultimatly travese across the Pacific Ocean to battle against the Abyssal Fleets in the USA Mainland location where you would ultimately fight off the [[Central Princess]] in a final battle in Hawaii to ultimately beat the game.

==Reception==
Kancolle Kai received a decent score from Famitsu magazine which rated it around average of 7.5 among the 4 editors who reviewed the game. The reviewer described the game to be fun and engaging, but also leaving some things desired within it. Overall, KanColle Kai ended up selling over 138,000 copies over the course of the first week. Outside of that, little is known regarding many more units were sold outside of the fact that in a article Tanaka posted back in 2015 he stated that he aimed to get the game to sell 500,000 units in the first week, which it fell drastically short from reaching. Needless to say, those who bought the game as far view went were mixed with either enjoying the game, or feeling it was lacking in things which the browser version already fulfilled for them.

==Development History==
Kancolle Kai was first announced around the end of 2013 when they opened a new site to promote the upcoming game. The game was announced to have more details revealed on April 2014. During the months of April and through out the year, Kancolle Kai information was shown across various magazines but not much information regarding a planned release date was revealed until '''December 201'''4 in which they revealed the planned release date for Kancolle Kai was projected for '''May of 2015'''. 

At the end of March 2015, information was revealed that the game would be delayed to improve the game's mechanics and was to be pushed back till '''August 27, 2015'''. <br>
By the beginning of August 2015, the game was announced to be pushed back even further with a new date set for '''November 26,2015''' to ensure that game features would be working accordingly.<br>
But it would be delayed one more time to implement and include Kanmusu from the [[Fall 2015 Event]] which then pushed the game to it's final release date, which was set for '''February 18, 2016'''.

On that mentioned date, the game was released to the public and while it sold reasonably well (138,000 units on it's first week) it would however begin to slow down from there as two update took place to fix issues with the game and implement additional quests. But following that, the updates ceased and nothing was heard of from KanColle Kai's website until December 16, 2016 in which they announced that all sales for Physical and Digital copies of the game would cease being distrusted and sold through Japan's PlayStation Network on '''January 2017'''. Reason behind this change have not been explained and may remain unknown.

==Overview==
Using the original Kantai Collection game system and concept as a base, and making use of the PS Vita's touch screen interface, this version's gameplay is more akin to a smaller, simulation-type game. 

===Strategy Screen===
It will implement a strategy screen unique to the Vita version. The maps will be made up of hexes, and ships will be represented by silhouettes. Players can also transition to the Admiral's office from here. This strategy screen is just one of KanColle Kai's features. 

===End Turn/Move===
Commands can be given from the panel on the left side of the screen. Aside from the usual "Sortie" command, you will also see "End Turn" and "Move" as well. KanColle Kai is being developed as a standalone Turn-Based game.

===Remodeling Screen===
The classic remodeling screen has received a makeover, featuring a monotone theme. In addition to the ship girl's basic stats, the familiar icons for fuel, ammo, steel, and bauxite appear at the top of this screen.

===Changing Equipment===
Players can change their ship girls' equipment from the remodeling screen. Equipment categories include the usual: Main guns, torpedoes, machine guns, radar, and seaplanes, among others, and equipment can be assigned using the menu surrounding the ship girl.

===Transport Ships and Escort Teams===
Players may deploy escort teams to guard the transport ships which link each port and ocean area. These features - ocean hexes, a turn-based system, the ability to move the fleet, and the transport ships/escort teams - will all shift this game to be more simulation-focused, setting it apart from the original.
