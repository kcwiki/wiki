===Analysis===
'''Kagerou Kai'''

Priority: '''Low'''

:At first remodel, she has low firepower and a decent torpedo stat, making her hitting harder in night battle than at day, but not great at either.
:While not impressive in combat, do keep in mind than many maps require you to bring at least a few destroyers for routing.
:Furthermore, destroyers are cheap to deploy and can equip [[Drum Canister]], making them suited for expeditions.


'''Kagerou Kai Ni''' 

Priority: '''Low'''
:Her second remodel increases her Firepower and Torpedo stats to excellent levels for a destroyer, making her excellently suited for surface combat, and also raises her ASW allowing her to perform OASW at high-but-before-marriage levels with proper gear.
:While her night battle potential is very high, her base luck is low and doesn't allow her to use night cut-in attacks reliably. (Raising her Luck stat is an option for veteran admirals.)
:Additionally, keep in mind that this remodel requires a [[Blueprint]].


====Recommended Roles====
* Surface combat (Second remodel)
* ASW (Second remodel)

===Important Information===
* Required for A32, A87, A88, B21, B116, and B117.
* An option for C15 and C21.
* Comes with a [[12.7cm Twin Mount Type-C Kai 2]] on Kai Ni
