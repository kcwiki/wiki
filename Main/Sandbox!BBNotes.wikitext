'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''
* She has accuracy bonuses and penalties when equipped with certain large guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority:

* Kai/Kai Ni: '''High'''
: She and her sisters are the only fast battleships obtainable through normal construction. Until you get the LSC and event fast battleships, you will be depending heavily on the Kongou-class when you need battleships for maps with speed restrictions.  
: Her Kai has low firepower and defensive stats but she is still usable.
: Her Kai Ni improves her firepower and defensive stats. When taking into account her rarity, remodel level and remodel cost; she is a necessary fast battleship for every admiral. However, do note that her AACI has a low fixed shootdown and weak multiplier. It also has a high API number which means it will override nearly all other AACI in the fleet.

* Kai Ni C: '''Low'''
: She gains a bit of HP and a significant torpedo stat. She also loses a bit of armour. The torpedo stat puts her on par with the Yamato-class during night battles but due to being unable to equip 51cm guns, she falls slightly short. Her ability to carry seaplane bombers doesn't amount to much because of her small slot sizes. They are liable to get emptied. The steep cost of this remodel is another strike against it.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Support Expeditions

====Not Recommended Roles====

===Important Info===
* Required for unlocking the 4th fleet slot.

* She has accuracy bonuses and penalties when equipped with certain large guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority: 

* Kai: '''High'''
: She is easy to obtain and has a low remodel level which makes her a good aviation battleship for newer players. She functions just fine as a seaplane fighter carrier for taking air superiority in maps where carriers are restricted. However, her low firepower means she underperforms in combat compared to other battleships.
* Kai Ni: '''Medium'''
: Her Kai Ni gives her a significant boost to her firepower that brings her closer to the other battleships. Though she is still on the low side compared to the other slow battleships. She does gain a huge improvement to her slot distribution since she now has a single large slot that allows her to carry seaplane bombers with a lot less risk that the slot will be emptied. The size of her bottom slot means that she'll also have decent airstrike power against soft targets. She does make a good stopgap aviation battleship until you get [[Ise]] to Kai Ni, which will take a while and cost a lot.

'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''
* She has accuracy bonuses and penalties when equipped with certain large guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority:

* Kai: '''High'''
: She has low firepower and defensive stats for a battleship which makes her a poor choice for combat. Her low remodel level is a plus but it is tempered by her rarity. Her main use will be carrying seaplane fighters to contest air superiority in maps where carriers are restricted. While her AACI has a decent fixed shootdown and multiplier, it requires sacrificing too many equipment slots to be worthwile. The main reason why she is high priority is that she is required to upgrade the [[12cm 30-tube Rocket Launcher]] to [[12cm 30 Tube Rocket Launcher Kai 2]] with [[Akashi]].
* Kai Ni: '''Medium'''
: Her Kai Ni brings incredible flexibility with 5 slots and the ability to equip carrier fighters. She outperforms every other aviation ship when it comes to air support in maps where carriers are restricted. Do note that carrier-based recons and dive bombers are unable to trigger artillery spotting. Unfortunately, she doesn't get a significant upgrade combat-wise which leaves her lacking compared to other battleships. Her remodel also comes at a very steep cost since it requires Prototype Catapults.

'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''
* She has accuracy bonuses and penalties when equipped with certain large guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority:

* Kai: '''High'''
: She has low firepower and defensive stats for a battleship which makes her a poor choice for combat. Her low remodel level is a plus but it is tempered by her rarity. Her main use will be carrying seaplane fighters to contest air superiority in maps where carriers are restricted. While her AACI has a decent fixed shootdown and multiplier, it requires sacrificing too many equipment slots to be worthwile. The main reason why she is high priority is that she is required to upgrade the [[12cm 30-tube Rocket Launcher]] to [[12cm 30 Tube Rocket Launcher Kai 2]] with [[Akashi]].
* Kai Ni: '''Low'''
: Her Kai Ni brings incredible flexibility with 5 slots and the ability to equip carrier fighters. She isn't as good as [[Ise]] when it comes to providing air support due to her slot distribution, but she is still better than every other aviation ship in this respect. Do note that carrier-based recons and dive bombers are unable to trigger artillery spotting. Unfortunately, she doesn't get a significant upgrade combat-wise which leaves her lacking compared to other battleships. While she is able to perform OASW, she is unable to take advantage of ASW synergy bonuses which limits her damage potential. Her remodel also comes at a very steep cost since it requires Prototype Catapults. 

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat - Kai Ni
* Air Support

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Combat - Kai
* Support Expeditions
* Anti-Submarine
* Anti-Air

===Important Info===
* Required for quests A18, A60, A61, A77, B54, B102, B114, B132, C22, F86 and F87 
* She is an option for A43 and Bm4.

=Nagato=
==Gameplay Notes==
===Special Mechanics===
* She can carry seaplane fighters on kai.
* She gains the ability to equip small-caliber guns, daihaitsu and tank on Kai Ni.
* She gains a special attack on Kai Ni called "'''Full broadside... Sounds exciting!'''" (一斉射かッ…胸 が熱いな！) that targets 3 enemies at random. 
** Activation requirements are as follows:  
*** Nagato Kai Ni must be the flagship.
*** Another battleship must be in the 2nd position.
*** She must not be more than <span style="color:gold;">'''lightly damaged (小破)'''</span>.
*** The rest of the fleet must not contain a submarine.
*** '''Echelon formation''' needs to be selected in a single fleet OR '''Cruising Formation 2''' for a combined fleet.
** If triggered, Nagato will do two attacks with a 1.4x post-cap modifier and the other battleship will do a 3rd attack with a 1.2x post-cap modifier.
*** If [[Mutsu]] is the 2nd ship, Nagato gains a 1.61x post-cap modifier while Mutsu gains a 1.62x post-cap modifier.
*** If [[Mutsu|Mutsu Kai Ni]] is the 2nd ship, both Nagato and Mutsu will gain a 1.68x post-cap modifier.
*** If [[Nelson]] is the 2nd ship, Nagato will gain a 1.54x post-cap modifier while Nelson gains a 1.5x post-cap modifier.
*** An AP shell will provide an extra 1.35x multiplicative bonus.
*** A radar with 5 or more LoS stat will provide an extra 1.15x multiplicative bonus.

** It can be triggered even if you fail to activate artillery spotting.
** It can only be activated '''once per sortie'''.
** It has a chance to trigger every time Nagato takes a turn at shelling. If it fails to trigger in day, there is a chance to trigger it in the followup night battle.
** The attack will consume extra ammo from both participating battleships when triggered. The total ammo consumption will be x1.5 of the original ammo consumption of when the attack is triggered ([https://twitter.com/syoukuretin/status/1063895644790677504 Source]), hence:

**If it is triggered in day battle, it costs 10% extra ammo.
**If it is triggered in an night battle node, it costs 5% extra ammo.
**If it is triggered in a night battle in a normal node, it costs 15% extra ammo.

===Overview===
'''Kai'''
* Good firepower, HP and armour.

'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''
* She has accuracy bonuses and penalties when equipped with certain large guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority: 

* Kai: '''High'''
: Being obtainable from normal construction and having a low remodel level makes her a valuable part of the fleet. Her high firepower, armour and HP will make her a mainstay until you obtain the LSC or event-only battleships. Although she can carry seaplane fighters, she needs to compromise her combat ability to do so.
* Kai Ni: '''Medium-High'''
: Your first Kai Ni between [[Nagato]] and [[Mutsu]] should be a priority because of their powerful skill. Ideally Nagato herself due to quest prequisites. Aside from that, she gains a significant boost to her firepower and armour. Her ability to equip daihatsu also gives her potential in the anti-installation role. Though her performace against surface targets will suffer. Her blueprint requirement and high remodel level makes her take a back seat to other battleships if you already have Mutsu at Kai Ni.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Anti-Installation - Kai Ni
* Support Expeditions

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Air Support

===Important Info===
* Required for quests A42, A74, B31, and B99. 
* An option for A43 and Bm4.

** Activation requirements are as follows:

**If it is triggered in an night battle node, it costs 5% extra ammo.
**If it is triggered in a night battle in a normal node, it costs 15% extra ammo.

'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''
* She has accuracy bonuses and penalties when equipped with certain large guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority: 

* Kai: '''High'''
: Being obtainable from normal construction and having a low remodel level makes her a valuable part of the fleet. Her high firepower, armour and HP will make her a mainstay until you obtain the LSC or event-only battleships. Although she can carry seaplane fighters, she needs to compromise her combat ability to do so.
* Kai Ni: '''Medium-High'''
: Your first Kai Ni between [[Mutsu]] and [[Nagato]] should be a priority because of their powerful skill. Aside from that, she gains a significant boost to her firepower and armour. Her ability to equip WG42 and tanks also gives her potential in the anti-installation role. Though her performace against surface targets will suffer. Her blueprint requirement and high remodel level makes her take a back seat to other battleships if you already have Nagato at Kai Ni.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Anti-Installation - Kai Ni
* Support Expeditions

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Air Support

===Important Info===
* Required for quests A42, A75, A92, B22, B24, B31, B99, B129, and B130. 
* An option for A43 and Bm4.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''
: She is a powerful battleship that is relatively easy to obtain. However, since she is from LSC, she is prohibitively expensive for new players compared to the benefits she brings. She is also very costly to run. Although she can carry seaplane fighters, she needs to compromise her combat ability to do so.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''
: She is a powerful battleship that is relatively easy to obtain. However, since she is from LSC, she is prohibitively expensive for new players compared to the benefits she brings. She is also very costly to run. Although she can carry seaplane fighters, she needs to compromise her combat ability to do so. Her AACI is also bad with a low fixed shootdown and multiplier.
: Her Kai Ni makes her the most powerful battleship in the game. Along with the significant boosts to her firepower, HP and armour; she gets 5 slots which give her incredible flexibility in her loadout. The 5th slot allows her to carry a seaplane fighter to assist with air support without sacrificing her combat ability. Her AACI has a good fixed shootdown and decent multiplier. However, it requires a secondary gun to activate, it can interfere with her artillery spotting and night battle attacks. It is an option to use in combined fleets where her night battle performance is irrelevant. All this comes at a very high cost which can be better spent elsewhere for newer admirals.

'''Zwei'''

===Fit Bonuses===
'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''
* She has accuracy bonuses and penalties when equipped with certain large guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''

: Both her Kai and Zwei have decent firepower and defensive stats for a fast battleship. She doesn't really bring anything else to the table other than that. Being an LSC-only ship and the added cost of a blueprint for her Zwei, it makes her not worth it.
: Her Drei gives her a torpedo stat that puts her on par with the Yamato-class for night battles but due to being unable to equip 51cm guns, she falls short. She also requires a second blueprint which is a steep cost for the minimal upgrade.

* Combat

'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''
* She has accuracy bonuses and penalties when equipped with certain large guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''

: She is a fast battleship with high firepower, which makes her a good choice for maps with speed restrictions. Her ability to carry seaplane fighters means she can also assist with air power on maps with speed restrictions. However, this will compromise her combat ablity. She also requires a blueprint which is a steep cost for the benefit she brings.

Priority: '''Medium'''

: She has very high firepower for a fast battleship and her high defensive stats make her even better. Her drawbacks are that she is an event-only drop and she is very costly to run. If you do have her, and resources are not an issue, she is a top pick for a fast battleship.

'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''
* She has accuracy bonuses and penalties when equipped with certain large guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''

: She has good firepower for a slow battleship but her defensive stats are lower than other slow battleships. Her AACI has a low fixed shootdown and multiplier. It also has a high API number which can interfere with other AACI in the fleet. Her advantage is her low cost which makes her a good choice for support expeditions.

===Fit Bonuses===
'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''
* She has accuracy bonuses and penalties when equipped with certain large guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Very Low'''

: Her Kai has low firepower and HP for a battleship. Her armour is decent but nowhere near enough to make up for her lack of combat ability.
: At Dva, she gains a torpedo stat that makes her respectable in night battles but she still suffers from low daytime combat ability. Her advantage of having a low remodel level and cost to gain the torpedo stat is outweighed by her status as event-only and being slow.

===Special Mechanics===
* Able to perform special AACI. Please see [[Aerial_Combat#Anti-Air_Cut-In|Anti-Air Cut-In]] for more details.
* She has a special attack called the '''Nelson Touch''' that targets 3 enemies at random.
** The activation requirements are:
*** Nelson as the flagship of the 1st fleet.
*** Nelson must not be more than <span style="color:gold;">'''lightly damaged (小破)'''</span>.
*** There must be 6 ships in the fleet.
*** There must be no submarines in the fleet.
*** The 3rd and 5th ships must not be a carrier.
*** '''Double line formation''' needs to be selected in a single fleet OR '''Cruising Formation 2''' for a combined fleet.
** If triggered, Nelson, the 3rd ship, and the 5th ship will perform one attack each with a 2x post-cap modifier.
*** If the engagement is <span style="color:red;">Red T</span>, then the post-cap modifier becomes 2.5x.
** It can be triggered even if you fail to activate artillery spotting.
** It can only be activated '''once per sortie'''.
** It has a chance to trigger every time Nelson takes a turn at shelling. If it fails to trigger in day, there is a chance to trigger it in the followup night battle.
** It does not cost any extra resources if triggered.

* She has accuracy bonuses and penalties when equipped with certain large guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''High'''

: She has great firepower for a battleship but what really makes her stand out is her powerful special ability. Unlike [[Nagato]] and [[Mutsu]], her ability does not take extra ammo when it triggers; but it has a slightly weaker multiplier and requires 3 good ships instead of just 2 to make full use of it. Although she is event-only and hard to get, she'll serve you very well when you do get her. Her AACI has a low fixed shootdown and multiplier which makes it inadvisable to run.

*** Colorado, the 2nd, and 3rd ships must not be more than <span style="color:gold;">'''lightly damaged (小破)'''</span>.
*** '''Echelon formation''' needs to be selected in a single fleet OR '''Cruising Formation 2''' for a combined fleet.
** If triggered, Colorado will perform a special attack at 1.3x post-cap modifier and the 2nd and 3rd ship will perform an attack at 1.15x post-cap modifier.
*** If the 2nd ship is a Big 7, she gains an additional 1.1x post-cap modifier.
*** If the 3rd ship is a Big 7, she gains an additional 1.15x post-cap modifier.
*** If both the 2nd and 3rd ships are a Big 7, the 3rd ship gains an additional 1.1x post-cap modifier.

* She has accuracy bonuses and penalties when equipped with certain large guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''

: Her firepower is not bad but she loses out to the other slow battleships. She is the weakest of the Big 7s with special attacks and that firepower gap is even bigger when taking into account multipliers. Her special attack also has the lowest multipliers among all the Big 7. It is also the most inflexible since it requires her and the two escorts to not be more than moderatly damaged Being event only, she is very rare but don't stress if you can't get her.
