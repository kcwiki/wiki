==Trivia==
* Appeared first in [[Summer 2014 Event]]
* Appears in a pre-boss node for 3-5.
* Weak against [[Type 3 Shell]] and [[WG42 (Wurfgerät 42)|WG42]] as with all installation-type bosses.
*Damage text is different from others:
**Slightly damaged(小破) →　Confused(混乱)
**Moderately damaged(中破) →　Damaged(損害)
**Heavily damaged(大破) → Broken(損壊)
**Sunken(撃沈) →　Destroyed(破壊)
* Known as Dutch Harbor and Hoppou-chan (北方 = "Hoppou" = Northern)
* The plane she is carrying on her 2nd form is the [[wikipedia:Akutan_Zero|Akutan Zero]] ( An A6M plane that crashlanded on Akutan Island).
* The theme that plays during her 3-5 battle is called 'Shikon's Defense'. "Shikon" was the nickname of the 11th Tank Battalion, who fought at the Battle of Shumshu, and means "warrior spirit". It comes from combining the kanji for eleven 十一 into the kanji for warrior 士. The 11th Tank Battalion was deployed in the far North as a garrison on a defensive mission. This is the same battalion referenced in the title of the [[Spring_2017_Event#E-4|Spring 2017 Event's fourth map]].
