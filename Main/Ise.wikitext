==Trivia==
*She is named after [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ise_Province Ise Province], modern day [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_Prefecture Mie Prefecture].
*Sunk by air attack on the 28th of July, 1945.
*At first, ''Ise'' and ''[[Hyuuga]]'' were planned to be built as the 3rd and 4th of the [[:Category:Fuso Class|''Fusou''-class]] battleships, but because of many defects found in [[Fuso]] and [[Yamashiro]] along with budget problems, their construction was put off. In this period, improving on the ''Fusou''-class battleships, the design of ''Ise'' & ''Hyuuga'' was widely changed (e.g. positioning of 3rd, 4th turrets, see the photo cited from [https://archive.org/details/brasseysnavala1923brasuoft%7C Brassey's Naval Annual 1923] p.426) and at last they were built as ''Ise''-class battleships.

[[File:Brassey's_Naval_Annual_1923_p.426.jpg|250px|right]]
* During WW2, ''Ise'' & ''Hyuuga'' were converted into aviation battleships. There were two reasons for doing so. Firstly, in an exercise on the 5th of July 1942, there was an accident on the fifth turret of ''Hyuuga'' and she needed repairs. Two, the Japanese Navy had to compensate for the loss of 4 regular aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in June 1942 (''[[Akagi]]'', ''[[Kaga]]'', ''[[Souryuu]]'' and ''[[Hiryuu]]''). Because of this, instead of being restored to her original state, ''Hyuuga'' was remodeled as an aviation battleship (''Ise'' received the same treatment.)
* Though they became aviation battleships, they were not utilized as aviation battleships in combat partly because there were not enough planes available for them, and they served solely as normal battleships until they were sunk. This can be seen from the fact that their catapults were removed.
