[[File:Saurylogo2019.png|center]]
The '''Naval District Saury Festival''' ''(鎮守府秋刀魚祭り)'' is an annually held '''mini-event''' that started back in '''October 9th, 2015''' and lasted till '''October 30th, 2015'''. The main theme of the campaign centers around collecting Pacific Saury from various parts of the Ocean Waters which can be collected to exchanged for various resources and for completing quests that are tied to the annually held campaign which can reward various rewards and ultimately a "Big Catch Flag" which can be placed up as a decoration in your main base to signify that you've completed the quests for the season.

The mini event has return on '''October 21st, 2016''' with the same theme, but a whole new set of quests along with a brand new "Big Catch Flag" for the year and will last till '''November 4th, 2016'''.

The Third Annual '''Naval District Saury Festival''' began on '''September 29th, 2017''' and ran for 2 weeks and ran in collaboration with the [[Naval District Saury Festival in Yokohama]]

The 4th Annual  '''Naval District Saury Festival''' is set to begin on '''October 10th, 2018''' and will serve as a tie-in Collaboration to the '''[[Second Naval District Saury Festival (Live Event)]]''' which was launched on '''October 5th, 2018 across Japan.'''

The 5th Annual Festival has been renamed to the '''Naval District Saury & Sardine Festival''' and is set to begin on '''October 25th, 2019'''. This event was renamed and changed due to current events taking place in Japan where Saury fishing has been poor this year but Sardine sails has been quite high. As such, the theme of this event will be to catch '''both Saury and Sardines'''  

==How to Obtain== 

Pacific Saury can be obtained from [[#Fishing Zones| several maps]] during the event. They drop more frequently than the [[Seasonal/Hishimochi_2015|Hishimochi]], but will require appropriate equipment to do so.  [[File:Saury notification.png|thumb|right|300px|Pacific Saury has been successfully caught!]]

Fish can only be found in certain sortie maps; when your fleet go to certain sortie maps and enters battle, [[Naval_District_Saury_Festival#Music|Special Saury Festvial themed music]] will cue. 
[[File:Saury drop.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Pacific Saury drop]]

Within the fishing zones, your fleet must battle the abyssal fleet and score an S rank (or an A rank in World 3). Upon completion, you will have a chance for saury to drop. After the battle, you might receive a notification that you have fished some saury and will then receive it prior to any ship drops. 

The Pacific saury cannot be used for anything by itself; you must collect several of them in order to [[#Cooking Saury|"cook" them to make them into resources or a new seasonal item]].

In order to raise your chance of obtaining Pacific saury, you will need to use specific equipment (note that multiple pieces synergize). According to the Dev's Tweet [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/652653047869403138] they mention that you need to use equipment in order to '''"Search"''', '''"Gather"''', and '''"Locate"''' the Pacific Saury. Based on that information alone, it suggests that it hints that in order to find the fish you'll need to '''"Search"''' with a [[File:Sonar.png]]'''Sonar''',  '''"Gather"''' the fish with a [[File:searchlight.png]]'''Searchlight''', '''"Locate"''' them with [[File:Ssp_c.png]]'''Skilled Lookouts''', and you can use '''"explosive"''' '''Depth Charges [[File:DepthCharge.png]]'''. (Be advised: Depth Charges can cause overfishing to occur faster)

With 2017, they added in a '''Scout and Sweep''' for fish using a variety if planes which includes, [[File:Seaplane.png]]'''Seaplane Scouts''' (Only the ones with 2 floats), [[File:YellowPlane.png]]'''Carrier based Scouting planes''', [[File:Large_Flying_Boat.png]] '''Flying Boats''', [[File:BluePlane.png]] '''Swordfish''' and [[File:Heli.png]] '''GyroCopters'''.

You can also stack equipment to improve your success rate with scoring a Pacific Saury.

In addition, Destroyer Escorts such as [[Shimushu]], [[Kunashiri]], [[Etorofu]], and [[Matsuwa]] can be used to help boost the chances of scoring fish as well.

You can hold up to a maximum of 99 Raw Pacific Saury at a time without cooking them.

==Overfishing==
'''Overfishing''' can result if a player fishes a map for too long result in the Saury drop rate to drastically decrease. The exact cause of overfishing is not exactly determined as of this point but it is recommended that if the Saury drop rate decreases on a map to take a break from it and fish in another map that has Saury. Saury drop rates should recover in due time.

In additon, using '''Depth Charges''' [[File:DepthCharge.png]] can also speed up the effects of overfishing if used too much. So please be careful how much you use them.

== Fishing Zones ==

Saury have higher chances of dropping in the fishing zones within 1-5 and 1-6, all of world 3, and in 6-1 and 6-5.

== Cooking Pacific Saury ==

When you have obtained enough Pacific Saury, you can use a specific amount to cook up a saury-based meal and then trade it in for resources.
When you reach the item menu section you can choose between the following methods of cooking the  Pacific Saury. [[File:Saury Cooking Options.png|thumb|right|300px|The Saury Cooking Options as displayed on the Item Menu]]

[[File:Sashimi_option.png|Sashimi]]  [[File:Grilled_Salted_Option.png|Grilled and Salted]]  [[File:Kabayaki_Option.png|Kabayaki]]<br>


The three options for preparation are '''Sashimi''', '''Grilled and Salted''' or '''Kabayaki'''

{| class="wikitable"
|-

Remember that once the event is over all saury will expire and will be destroyed upon maintenance. So before the event ends, be sure to use your saury for cooking or preserve it as canned saury.

== Cooking Pacific Sardine ==

As of the 2019 Fishing event, Sardine is introduced as an alternative to Saury for fishing. 
Ties in the real life event where Japan experienced less Saury being catches in the sea as a result of overfishing 
The cooking options for Sardines is located in the item menu. Once you get to the item menu, you will see the following cooking options
[[File:Sardine Cooking Options.png|thumb|right|300px|The Sardine Cooking Options as displayed on the Item Menu]]

{| class="wikitable"

==Notes==
* While Depth Charges can help you score fish quickly, it will also make the location become depleted from fish much faster causing the overfishing effect to occur sooner. Avoid using them if possible unless you really need to.
* Pacific Saury and ship drops can be obtained at the same time.
* Pacific Saury can drop even when your ship capacity is full.
* Raw Pacific Saury will not stay after the event. '''Remember to can or cook your fish if you do not want them to go to waste!'''
