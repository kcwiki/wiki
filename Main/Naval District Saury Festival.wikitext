The '''Naval District Saury Festival''' ''(鎮守府秋刀魚祭り)'' is an annually held '''mini-event''' that started back in '''October 9th, 2015''' and lasted till '''October 30th, 2015'''. The main theme of the campaign centers around collecting Pacific Saury from various parts of the Ocean Waters which can be collected to exchanged for various resources and for completing quests that are tied to the annually held campaign which can reward various rewards and ultimately a "Big Catch Flag" which can be placed up as a decoration in your main base to signify that you've completed the quests for the season.

The mini event has return on '''October 21st, 2016''' with the same theme, but a whole new set of quests along with a brand new "Big Catch Flag" for the year and will last till '''November 4th, 2016'''.

The Third Annual '''Naval District Saury Festival''' began on '''September 29th, 2017''' and ran for 2 weeks and ran in collaboration with the [[Naval District Saury Festival in Yokohama]]

The 4th Annual  '''Naval District Saury Festival''' is set to begin on '''October 10th, 2018''' and will serve as a tie-in Collaboration to the '''[[Second Naval District Saury Festival (Live Event)]]''' which was launched on '''October 5th, 2018 across Japan.'''

The 5th Annual Festival has been renamed to the '''Naval District Saury & Sardine Festival''' and is set to begin on '''October 25th, 2019'''. This event was renamed and changed due to current events taking place in Japan where Saury fishing has been poor this year but Sardine sails has been quite high. As such, the theme of this event will be to catch '''both Saury and Sardines''' 

The 6th Annual Festival known as the '''Return of the Saury Festival''' (due to the fact that last year entire festival was canceled due to poor fishing IRL and situation happening in 2020) will be launched in late '''October 29th, 2021'''. It ended on the '''19th of November 2021'''. Unlike previous events, this festival will be held along with the [[Fall 2021 Event]] as part of the theme. The Main Operation Event maps in this festival will contain Saury to catch and will conclude before the extra operations are launched.

==How to Obtain== 

Pacific Saury(Fish) can be obtained from [[#Fishing Zones/Ship Drops| several maps]] during the event. They drop more frequently than the [[Seasonal/Hishimochi_2015|Hishimochi]], but will require appropriate equipment to do so.  [[File:Saury notification.png|thumb|right|300px|Pacific Saury has been successfully caught!]]

Saury can only be found in certain sorties or event maps. [[Naval_District_Saury_Festival#Music|Special Saury Festival-themed music]] will play when entering battle on maps that contain saury. 
[[File:Saury drop.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Pacific Saury drop]]

Within the map nodes that contain saury, your fleet must battle the abyssal fleet and score an S rank (or an A rank on nodes [[#Fishing Zones/Ship Drops|highlighted in red below]]) for a chance of saury dropping. After the battle, you might receive a notification that you have fished some saury and will then receive it prior to any ship drops.

The Pacific saury cannot be used for anything by itself; you must collect several of them in order to [[#Cooking Pacific Saury|"cook" them to convert them into resources or a new seasonal item]].

By using specific equipment types, you will increase the chances of catching saury. These pieces of equipment can be carried by multiple ships in a fleet, and different types of equipment will synergize [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/652653047869403138]<!-- but stacking the same equipment on the same ship will '''Not''' give an additional bonus-->. Please refer to the [[#Effective Equipment |equipment chart]] below. Thus to maximize the bonus, it is recommended to carry as a diverse set of bonus equipment<!-- with duplicates spread across different ships-->.

In addition, [[Coastal Defense Ships]] can be used to help boost the chances of scoring fish as well. They have an innate fishing bonus chance.

You can hold up to a maximum of 99 Raw Pacific Saury at a time without cooking them. If you are close to that number, it is recommended to turn them into resources, with screws being the popular choice. Please note that the [[#Saury Quests| saury event quests]] only count the total number of saury in your inventory. Saurys that have been cooked do not count so it is recommended that you catch at least 33 sauries and finish the quests before using them up.

Fish stocks are calculated on a world basis, so fishing on different maps in the same world will all count towards overfishing.

===Overfishing===
'''Overfishing''' can occur if a player successfully fishes a map for too long, resulting in the Saury drop rate drastically decreasing. It is caused by catching a lot of saury on maps in the same world. Using depth charges also speeds up the overfishing rate. When a world is beginning to be overfished, the saury catch rate will start decreasing until you are unable to catch any fish at all after multiple sorties (due to extremely low catch chance).

Once a world is overfished you have to wait for the fish to be restocked (the exact amount of fish restocked and time needed is not known). If everywhere is overfished then you just have to wait for a day or more to begin fishing again. It is recommended that you cycle between the world maps and the event map, if you do not catch anything after say 5 sorties, move on to the next.

{{:Naval District Saury Festival/Fishing Equipment}}

==Fishing Zones/Ship Drops==
All listed nodes drop on S ranks, <span style="color:red;">red</span> nodes are known to drop on A ranks (usually at a lower rate).

== Cooking Pacific Saury ==

When you have obtained enough Pacific Saury, you can use a specific amount to cook up a saury-based meal and then trade it in for resources.
When you reach the item menu section you can choose between the following methods of cooking the  Pacific Saury. [[File:Saury Cooking Options.png|thumb|right|300px|The Saury Cooking Options as displayed on the Item Menu]]

[[File:Sashimi_option.png|Sashimi]]  [[File:Grilled_Salted_Option.png|Grilled and Salted]]  [[File:Kabayaki_Option.png|Kabayaki]]<br>


The three options for preparation are '''Sashimi''', '''Grilled and Salted''' or '''Kabayaki'''

{| class="wikitable"
|-

Remember that once the event is over all saury will expire and will be destroyed upon maintenance. So before the event ends, be sure to use your saury for cooking or preserve it as canned saury.

== Cooking Pacific Sardine ==

As of the 2019 Fishing event, Sardine is introduced as an alternative to Saury for fishing. 
Ties in the real life event where Japan experienced less Saury being catches in the sea as a result of overfishing 
The cooking options for Sardines is located in the item menu. Once you get to the item menu, you will see the following cooking options

'''Important Note:''' Once the event ended, similar to Saury, Sardines will be destroyed if not being cooked. Recommended to either try and cook it as Sashimi, Tsumire, or Sushi style in order to get the listed above rewards before the event ends.
==Saury Quests==
During the time of the Saury Mini Event, there will be a list of limited time quests that you can complete while the event is active. The following quests are as followed based on the year the event was held:

==Notes==
* While Depth Charges can help you score fish quickly, it will also make the location become depleted from fish much faster causing the overfishing effect to occur sooner. Avoid using them if possible unless you really need to.
* Pacific Saury and ship drops can be obtained at the same time.
* Pacific Saury can drop even when your ship capacity is full.
* Raw Pacific Saury will not stay after the event. '''Remember to can or cook your fish if you do not want them to go to waste!'''
