===Analysis===
'''Murasame Kai'''

Priority: '''Low'''

:At first remodel, she has low firepower and a decent torpedo stat, making her hitting harder in night battle than at day, but not great at either.
:While not impressive in combat, do keep in mind than many maps require you to bring at least a few destroyers for routing.
:Furthermore, destroyers are cheap to deploy and can equip [[Drum Canister]], making them suited for expeditions.


'''Murasame Kai Ni''' 

Priority: '''Medium'''
:Her second remodel increases nearly all of her combat stats making her a versatile destroyer, allowing her to perform OASW and also granting her the ability to equip [[Fleet Command Facility]] and [[Daihatsu]] for expeditions or an anti-installation role (however, she cannot operate tanks).
:Keep in mind that this remodel requires an Action Report.

====Recommended Roles====
* Surface combat (Second remodel)
* ASW (Second remodel)
* Expeditions (Second remodel)
* Anti-installation (Second remodel)

===Important Information===
* Required for A78, A84, B103, and B112.
