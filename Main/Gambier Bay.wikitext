==Gameplay Notes==
===Special Mechanics===
* She counts as an escort carrier and can be part of a Transport Escort Fleet. See [[Combined Fleet]] for more details.
* She can perform OASW when certain requirements are fulfilled:
** With a Sonar and aircraft with 7 or more ASW - 50 ASW
** With aircraft that have 7 or more ASW - 65 ASW

===Overview===
* Low firepower, HP and armour.
* Good ASW.
* Low plane count.
* Bad slot distribution.

===Fit Bonuses===
{{:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Equipment Bonuses}}
{{clear}}

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''
: Her firepower is on the low side and she is made worse by her low plane count and only having 3 slots to work with. All her slots are small which severely limits her damage potential. Although she can OASW, she is unable to take advantage of synergy bonuses which limits her potential.

===Not Recommended Roles===
* Combat
* ASW
* Air Support
* Shelling Support
* Airstrike Support
