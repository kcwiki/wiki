==Introduction==
紅茶の国で建造されたビックセブン、条約下時代に建造された16inch砲搭載超弩級戦艦ネルソン級。その主兵装として、同艦前部に集中配備された大口径三連装戦艦主砲です。同射撃管制用最新アナログコンピューターAdmiralty Fire Control Tableの熟成改良を重ね、その射撃精度を向上させました。ネルソン級などで運用することで、高い戦闘力を発揮します。

''The Nelson-class was a class of super-dreadnoughts that were built with 16 inch guns in the land of black tea as part of the Big Seven under the naval treaty. These large-caliber triple battleship guns were used as their main armament and carried entirely in the front. Their shelling accuracy has been increased by improving the Admiralty Fire Control Table, their latest analogue computer fire-control system. Using them on ships like the Nelson-class should allow them to demonstrate their high combat efficiency.''
