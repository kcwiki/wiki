==Introduction==
水上戦闘艦に配備可能な熟練見張員です。<br>その鍛え抜かれた肉眼視力による偵察力・索敵力は状況によっては大きな威力を発揮し、敵艦隊のレーダー兵装が充実するまでは、特に夜戦などで水上艦隊の攻撃力を支えました。 

''Skilled lookouts can be deployed on surface warships. Using their skilled naked eyes, they can largely contribute in scouting the enemy depending on the situation and before the advent of enemy radars, can spot for targets especially during night battles.'' 

==Historical Background==
A crow's nest is a structure in the upper part of the main mast of a ship or a structure that is used as a lookout point. <br>
This position ensured the best view for lookouts to spot approaching hazards, other ships or land. It was the best device for this purpose until the invention of radar.

==Notes==
*'''Unbuildable.''' January 2015 Ranking reward. Could be obtained via a [[Hishimochi]]-related event-only quest. Stock equipment of [[Choukai|Choukai Kai Ni]], [[Kazagumo|Kazagumo Kai]] and [[Takanami|Takanami Kai]].
*Increases special attack chance and critical hit chance of '''the ship equipped with it''' during night battle.
:*'''Unlike [[Star Shell]]s or [[Searchlight]], the effect does not extend to other ships in your fleet.''' The visual effect of the equipment can be seen [http://youtu.be/fFsMyZ3LtrQ?t=30s here]. You see a sparkle at the corner of the ship's image right before the cut-in animation.
