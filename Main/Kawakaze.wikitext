===Analysis===
'''Kawakaze Kai'''

Priority: '''Low'''

:At first remodel, she has low firepower and a decent torpedo stat, making her hitting harder in night battle than at day, but not great at either.
:While not impressive in combat, do keep in mind than many maps require you to bring at least a few destroyers for routing.
:Furthermore, destroyers are cheap to deploy and can equip [[Drum Canister]], making them suited for expeditions.


'''Kawakaze Kai Ni''' 

Priority: '''Medium'''
:Her second remodel increases many of her combat stats making her a versatile destroyer, also granting her the ability to equip [[Daihatsu]] for expeditions or an anti-installation role (however, she cannot operate tanks).
:She does not require an Action Report for this remodel, unlike her sisters, but keep in mind that her ASW stat is lower than theirs.

====Recommended Roles====
* Surface combat (Second remodel)
* Expeditions (Second remodel)
* Anti-installation (Second remodel)

===Important Information===
* Required for A68, B68, and B136.
