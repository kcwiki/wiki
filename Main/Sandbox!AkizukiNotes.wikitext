===Analysis===
Priority: '''High'''
: She has decent firepower but bad torpedo which makes her a subpar combat destroyer. Where she shines is her AACI which has a great fixed shootdown and high multiplier. It also triggers at a good rate which makes her one of the more reliable AACI ships. Her other key use is as a source of the critical [[10cm Twin High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]] guns.
