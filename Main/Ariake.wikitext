===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low-Medium'''

:At first remodel, she has low firepower and a decent torpedo stat, making her hitting harder in night battle than at day, but not great at either.
:While not impressive in combat, do keep in mind than many maps require you to bring at least a few destroyers for routing.

:Furthermore, destroyers are cheap to deploy and can equip [[Drum Canister]], making them suited for expeditions.
:She currently is the second lowest level DD capable of equipping Daihatsu-Class Landing Craft

====Recommended Roles====

==Trivia==
Secretary 3 Lines is referring to this event. (copypaste from wikipedia).  On 27–28 July 1943, Ariake was on a troop transport run to Tuluvu, New Britain. After grounding on a reef near Cape Gloucester (05°27′S 148°25′ECoordinates: 05°27′S 148°25′E) with the destroyer Mikazuki, Ariake was able to work free. She removed troops and ComDesDiv 30 (Captain Orita Tsuneo) from Mikazuki and completed the mission to Tuluvu, then returned to assist Mikazuki. She was sunk while so engaged by U.S. Army B-25 Mitchells. Seven men were killed, along with Ariake's captain, LtCdr Akifumi Kawahashi.

Wedding line about air cover might be references to end of December 1942 where she got hit by USAAF B-24 bombers, or a reference to all the aircraft carrier escort missions she did in Jan 1942 escorting Hiryuu and Souryuu, as well as between Feb 1943 and early July 1943 where she escorted Unyou, Hiyou, Ryuuhou, in 3 different missions.

16:00 o'clock line in the hourlies refer to the time at the end of December 1942, she suffered significant damage near Rabaul in an air raid by USAAF B-24 bombers while towin the damaged destroyer Uzuki. Six near misses killed 28 crewmen and injured 40 others, disabling her No.2 and No.3 gun turrets.
