==Introduction==
艦隊型駆逐艦の主砲のマイナーチェンジバージョンです。<br>
基本形と同様、防盾で全周を遮蔽、弾片や荒天対策を施しており、また本バージョンでは仰角範囲等も改良されました。<br>
駆逐艦夕立等に搭載されたとも云われています。

"This is a slightly improved version of the main guns of fleet destroyers.<br>
Like the basic form, but shielding the entire circumference with the mantlet, which protected from bullet and stormy weather, also in this version has been improved higher elevation range.

It is also said to have been mounted on many destroyer squadron."
Similar to the base model, it has a shielded, enclosed turret that protects against shrapnel and stormy weather. This version has had it's maximum elevation improved.<br>
It was equipped on the destroyer Yuudachi.

==Historical information==
This gun is the modified version of the twin gun ''Model B'' which was used by Ayanami-class and Akatsuki-class destroyer. The main difference between the Type A and Type B is that instead of the former's elevation range of −5° to +40°, type B's range is upgraded to 75°, which is required for the more complicated and effective AA systems installed on newer destroyers. Type B armour, however, was too thin to withstand heavy seas and splinter damage, thus the Type B Kai was introduced, adding more protection.

First mounted on [[Hatsuharu]]-class destroyers, but the effectiveness is unknown.
