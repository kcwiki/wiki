==Trivia==
*Satsuki received her Kai Ni upgrade on Feburary 29th, 2016
*Her Kai Ni upgrade is also a tie-in reference to her exploits during an air raid at Kavieng, New Ireland in 1944.
*Unlike most destroyers who usually need 2-3 specific kinds of of AA gear to perform an Anti-Air Cut In, Satsuki Kai Ni only needs to have a [[25mm Triple Autocannon Mount (Concentrated Deployment)]] to be able to perform an Anti-Air Cut in, but there is no other confirmation in which there are special AACI that are unique to her.
* The sword which Satsuki Kai Ni shows in her damaged art is a reference to the sword that was given to her captain, Lieutenant Commander Iino Tadao, as a reward for his exploits during an air raid at Kavieng, New Ireland in 1944.
*Sunk in air attack September 21, 1944 at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_Bay Manila Bay], Philippines ([http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Satsuki&params=14_35_N_120_45_E_ 14°35′N 120°45′E])
*Her name is an archaic word for "May", as the fifth month of the outmoded lunar calendar
*She is required by quests [[Quests#A49|A49]] and [[Quests#B39|B39]].
