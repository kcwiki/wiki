==Interim Policy Documentation Regarding Trivia Sections==
This needs to be fleshed out at some point, but for now this will do.

Trivia sections should involve in-game/canon-related stuff only. Stuff like "this line references this" such as Bismarck's cat, or the lost Gamby Bay thing. Any confirmed abyssal counterparts would also be an interesting thing to drop in trivia. At no point should we be prepping random insignificant facts about the real subjects; at best a Wikipedia link to the real subject should be dropped on pages (which wouldn't be a bad idea to add anyways for sake of completion). Information is only permissible if -and only if - to give context to something in the game. If it's just a general trivia piece then leave it alone. Ultimately, trivia should be relevant to the game itself.
