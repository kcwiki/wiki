===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''

: She has low firepower for a light carrier which limits her damage potential. Her evenly distributed slots are not good but workable because they are all on the small side. This means her airstrike power isn't that good but it also means she can easily spread her damage more evenly against more targets. She'll work just fine for airstrikes against soft targets.

====Recommended Roles====
* Air Support
* Airstrike Support

====Not Recommended Roles====
