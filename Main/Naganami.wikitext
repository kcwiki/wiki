===Analysis===
'''Naganami Kai'''

Priority: '''Low'''

:At first remodel, she has low firepower and a decent torpedo stat, making her hitting harder in night battle than at day, but not great at either.
:While not impressive in combat, do keep in mind than many maps require you to bring at least a few destroyers for routing.
:Furthermore, destroyers are cheap to deploy and can equip [[Drum Canister]], making them suited for expeditions.


'''Naganami Kai Ni''' 

Priority: '''Low (unless one is really scarce in high luck DDs)'''
:Her second remodel increases her Firepower and Torpedo stats to excellent levels for a destroyer, making her excellently suited for surface combat, and also raises her ASW allowing her to perform OASW attacks at high-but-before-marriage levels with proper gear.
:While her night battle potential is very high, her 30 base luck is low-ish and doesn't allow her to use night cut-in attacks too reliably. 
:Still, it's the highest among her sisters and could sort of work in a pinch. (Raising her Luck stat is an option for veteran admirals.)
:Additionally, keep in mind that this remodel requires a [[Blueprint]] and an [[Action Report]].


====Recommended Roles====
* Surface combat (Second remodel)
* ASW (Second remodel)
* Anti-installation (Second remodel)

===Important Information===
* Required for A55, A83, B47, C23, and BQ6.
* An option for A88, B117, C15, and C21. 
* Comes with a [[12.7cm Twin Mount Type-D Kai 2]] on Kai Ni
