==Notes==
* [[Summer 2014 Event]] E-5 boss, E-6 pre-boss
* [[Fall 2014 Event]] E-4 pre-boss, E-5 fleet member after five complete kills
* [[Winter 2015 Event]] E-4 boss
* [[Spring 2015 Event]] E-6 preboss node. Also appears in E-6's final kill as an escort.
* As with [[Midway Princess]], she essentially has real-life armament.
** Her planes are literal translations of the names of US Navy aircraft: the Abyssal Hell Diver is either the [[wikipedia:Curtiss_SBC_Helldiver|SBC Helldiver]] or the [[wikipedia:Curtiss_SB2C_Helldiver|SB2C Helldiver]], the Abyssal Hellcat Fighter is the [[wikipedia:Grumman_F6F_Hellcat|F6F Hellcat]] and the Abyssal Avenger Torpedo bomber is the [[wikipedia:Grumman_TBF_Avenger|TBF Avenger]]. Notably, the former 2 are named after aircraft not in service with the US Navy during the Battle of Midway, or were simply not present at the time. The original Helldiver did not see action in the Pacific theatre (it was relegated to the European theatre, and was most notably used by the French), and while its successor's first flight was in December of 1940, it was not put in service until the end of 1942. Meanwhile, the Hellcat hadn't even flown its first flight until late June of 1942 (weeks after the battle) and was not in service until the next year. Furthermore, the Hellcat was designed based on performance data gathered from the Zero recovered at the Aleutian Islands.
