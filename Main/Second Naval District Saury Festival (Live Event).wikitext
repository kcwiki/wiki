The '''KanColle Second Naval District Saury Festival (Live Event)''' is a live event that is taking place all over Japan across 10 major Japanese Seafood Resturants. Unlike last year's Saury Festival, this festival is more of a food based collaboration that is featuring Kancolle as part of the theme. 

The Collaboration was launched on '''October 5th, 2018''' across the 10 Major seafood stores. 9 of the seafood store's collaborations will last until '''October 14th, 2018''' while thier flagship store, the Uokoshi located in Chiyoda, Tokyo was orginally planned to run until '''November 7th, 2018'''. However, due to popular demand, the flagship store held and extension for the festival lasting from the''' November 8th - November 30th'''. And then a final extension occured that will last from '''December 1st - 9th'''. 

People will be able to purchase various Saury based meals and in return will be given various Kancolle related prizes for eating there. Other possible events are also taking place within the Uokoshi located in Chiyoda, Tokyo which will be explained further below.

== Reception ==

The overall feedback from people who attended the collaboration event has been overall positive, in most occasions, however during the initial start of the collaboration some people complained about registration processes getting messed up and various issues regarding some of the fish resturants' performances overall which included the following details: 

* Some stores didn't have dice to roll for some of the prizes
* Fish was left accidentally out in the sun during Day 1 causing part of that day's food supply to rot.
* Nagoya's shop division was loud and located near private housing areas. People complained about the noise.
* Some good ran out of stock after day one and restocking would be done at a later time.
* As a result, some people who roll for a Happi Coat and won had to work out a way to get it later on via mail.
* Some store clerks were becoming stress and wanted to leave during the start of the collaboration.
* Some workers were also overworked over the starting point of the collaboration.

During this time, the KC staff did attempt to try to work through thier twitter with some of the disgruntled customers as they did what they could to cater to them giving them compensation goods / fix work days and provide information for them to receive goods. Overall though, they were able to resolve most cases brought up on complaints.

Outside of these factors which occurred on opening day, most other days went by without issue and people were able to get thier goods accordingly. Eventually after the remaining 9 stores ended thier run and the Chiyoda Flagship store remained, most situations and complaints can to an end and feedback from the community that attended the Chiyoda store was met with a overall positive responds. With people mentioning that the overall experience was great for dining and drinking and the attempt to win prizes were considerably fair and as noted in later tweets, stocks were made to keep up with demand. In addition to it all, thanks to the popular demand form the Chiyoda Flagship store, the collaboration got extended twice all the way to early December.
