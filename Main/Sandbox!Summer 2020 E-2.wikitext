==Sandbox Rules==
This sandbox is to be used to construct an event guide for the above mentioned event map. These guides are to all of the following requirements:

* List of branching unlocking requirements (If there are multiple requirements, compositions for each path along with the below requirements will be needed to discuss the unlocking requirements in question)

* A list of working compositions that work: (These must have possible alternatives for players who may or may not have all ships needed for a specific path)

* The Path said composition will take (To explain what path the composition will take)

* A summary or description of what kind of obstacles a composition will face.

* A description of the boss node, what it consist and a descriptive guide on what the player should consider for a course of action to successfully win the battle.

* (Optional) Tips to farm to take path to collect certain ships (This will also require a composition, path, and possible description.

Editors are to construct thier own version of thier guide and complete them in a timely fashion. 

No other editors are to allowed to edit over other editor's work without the full consent of the editor and his approval to do so. 

Several version will be constructed through this page and will be reviewed and approved by the staff/ collaboration committee before being moved for the [[Summer 2020 Event]] which it'll be reviewed and updated once more before it can be released.

Overall there will be 3 version of the guide that will be constructed which will include:

*Preliminary Guide
*Polished Guide
*Finalized Guide

With each approval of each version the guide, the said guide will be updated to the main page and construction of the next version will begin.

All guides outside of the approved version will be removed and work will begin from the approved version to make it better for the next version until the finalized version is made.

===DarkHeron's Proposal===

Phase 1: Kill (New) Supply Depot Hime
* Supply Depot Hime this time got a huge HP bar (2400 for Hard mode)
* Use Transport Combined Fleet
** Recommend uses of Anti-Installation setup on escort ship in combined fleet
* Route: A-C-H-I-M

Phase 2:
*Route:

===Grunilgs Proposal (slight edits solo)===

'''Phase 1: Set New High Scores (Kill Supply Depot Hime)'''

* Defeat the new Supply Depot Hime. While her HP has been buffed considerably and she now has an opening torp, her core weakness remains the same. She is escorted by a CVL and some light surface units

* Composition: TCF: 1AV 1CAV 4DD + 1CL 1-2CA(V) 3-4DD

* LBAS: 1 Base, 5 Range to boss. (Both to boss node)

* Support Expeditions not required.

* Route: A-C-H-I-M, with C being a submarine node and H being a light surface engagement

* Air Parity on Hard LD is around 125('''TBC, rough value''') Fighter Power. As the SDH's core weakness remains unchanged, any Ship with a [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tanks & Marines)|DLC (T89)]] + [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank|KaMi Tank]] + [[WG42]]/[[Shipborne Model Type 4 20cm Anti-ground Rocket Launcher|T4 Mortar]] (or concentrated variant) is capable of taking her out in a single shot if it hits. Therefore it is highly recommended to set up at least one of your ships in a way that is capable of doing so. Falling short of that, T3 shells and night-time Tank/KaMi Double attacks can help. You may want to consider taking some OASW to help with Node C.

'''Phase 2: Unlock the Second Boss:'''

* AS+ (for Hard) on Nodes E and G. For this (114/330/591/723) Fighter Power is required on C/E/M/H.

* Composition: CTF: 2CV 1CV(L) 1AV 1CA(V) 1DD + 1CL 2DD 3XX

* LBAS: On Rest or 4 Fighter Sweeps to E/G if falling short of Fighter Power requirements

* Routes: A-B-E, A-B-D-G, with E/G being Airstrike Nodes and D being a submarine node

* Load your CV(L), CAV, and/or AV full of fighters/SPF and give the escort fleet OASW/AACI

'''Phase 3: Defeat the enemy Carrier Task Force:'''

* You are required to kill the enemy Wo-Class Kai 7 Times on Hard to clear the map. She herself is not particularly tanky or threatening , but is escorted by a BB Water Demon capable of soaking a lot of Damage as well as a CVL and some other light surface units

* Composition: CTF: 2CV 1CVL 1FBB 1CA(V) 1AV + 1CL 1CA 4DD ('''Fast fleet''')

* LBAS: 1 Base, 8 Range to the Boss. (Both to Boss node, AD should suffice)

* Support Expeditions not required.

* Route: A-B-D-G-N-P-T; G is an Airstrike Node, D is a submarine Node, N is a light surface engagement, and P is a light enemy Carrier Task Force containing up to 2 Nu Class Kai CVL.

* Heavier Route & Composition: '''CTF''': 5 Heavies (CV+BB) CL/(C)AV + 1CL 1CA 4DD. Goes through an additional Airstrike Node, O.

* Setting up your CV(L) for CVCI and going for AS (~400 Fighter Power with losses accounted for) should be sufficient for the main fleet. It is not worth setting up the fleet to be able to sink the BB Water Demon; it is better to increase the pass rate by taking OASW, AACI and DA on the escort fleet instead.

===Totaku's Proposal (using Grun's info as a base)===


'''Preparation'''

'''The event is likely to have several shiplocks (E-1 to E-4 already contain 4 separate locks), please plan your locks carefully.'''

For this operation, you will be organizing a combined fleet to fight against an installation with very high HP, along with achieving high air power and then facing off against a carrier fleet in the finale. As such you will make sure not only your ships are up to part for locking purposes, but to also make sure your equipment is capable enough to help take care of the installation.

The following thing could be considered for this map:

# Do you have anti-installation equipment?
# Do you have enough anti-installation ships and equipment to construct at least 1-2 Anti-installation nukes?
# Do you have a majority of the carriers including weaker ones like the Unryuu-class and/or Aquila?


* If you said yes to all of the above you should be more than ready to handle E-2 on Hard regardless of the strategy you choose.
* If you said yes to all but 3, weigh your carrier optional carefully before jumping into the map and avoid using key carriers that will be vital on later maps.
* If you said no to 2 you may need to possibly consider lowering difficulty as you will need means to deal damage up to around 700-1000+ against the boss.
* If you said no to one, then you may be new to the game and need to consider building some basic anti-installation(suchs as [[Type 3 Shell]]s before diving into E-2 on difficulties like Easy.

Below is a list of all the historical ships that have relevance to the Kure Naval District and Operation Ten-Go (in which this map takes place within.)

'''Ship Bonuses (Tentative)'''

''Kure Naval District Survivor Bonus''

* [[Ryuuhou]], [[Kitakami]], [[Ushio]], [[Verniy]]
** 1.26x bonus (Boss Nodes M, T)

* [[Sakawa]]
** 1.36x bonus (Boss Nodes M, T)

''Ten-Go Fleet Bonus''

* [[Yamato]], [[Yahagi]], [[Kasumi]], [[Suzutsuki]], [[Isokaze]], [[Hamakaze]], [[Yukikaze]], [[Asashimo]], [[Hatsushimo]]
** 1.36x bonus (Nodes M, T)


'''Some ships also have bonuses in later maps!''' [[Yahagi]], [[Sakawa]], [[Suzutsuki]] and [[Verniy]] is probably a safe choice to lock here. But things are subject to change once more information is available.

'''Phase 1: Set New High Scores (Kill Supply Depot Hime)'''

In this phase you will mainly be using a fleet that will have to go through fights with submarines, some surface ships, air attacks and possibly some battleships depending on the route you take before you reach the boss node. You will need to prepare accordingly  tp handle each node depending on the route you take.  

Depending on the difficulty, the [[Supply Depot Princess]] will be buffed considerably having up to '''2400 HP''' on Hard mode. While her HP has been buffed considerably and she now has an opening torp, her core weakness remains the same. She is escorted by a CVL and some light surface units.

Below is a list consisting of several possible methods that can be considered:

<tabber>
|-|TCF Method=
* Route: A-C-H-I-M
* '''Composition: TCF: 1AV 1CAV 4DD + 1CL 1-2CA(V) 3-4DD'''
* '''LBAS: 1 Base, 5 Range to boss. (Both to boss node)'''
** '''LBAS Recommendation: 1 Fighter, 3 Bombers or 4 Bombers'''
* Node C is a submarine node and H being a light surface engagement.
* Will completely above traveling to Node J.
* Speed is not a concern with this composition.
* Air Parity on Hard LD is around 125('''TBC, rough value''') Fighter Power.
* As the SDH's core weakness remains unchanged, any Ship with a [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tanks & Marines)|DLC (T89)]] + [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank|KaMi Tank]] + [[WG42]]/[[Shipborne Model Type 4 20cm Anti-ground Rocket Launcher|T4 Mortar]] (or concentrated variant) is capable of taking her out in a single shot if it hits. Therefore it is highly recommended to set up at least one of your ships in a way that is capable of doing so.
* Falling short of that, T3 shells and night-time Tank/KaMi Double attacks can help.

|-|STF CV Comp=
* '''Route: A-B-E-H-I-K-J-M'''
* '''Composition: STF: 1FBB 1 CVL 2-3 CA(V) 0-1 AV 1-2 CL + 1CL 0-1 CA(V) 3-4DD 0-1 SS(V)''' (All Fast)
* '''LBAS: 1 Base, 5 Range to boss. (Both to boss node)'''
** '''LBAS Recommendation: 1 Fighter, 3 Bombers or 4 Bombers'''
* Node E is an air attack node and H being a light surface engagement.
* ASW will not be needed along this route.
** An AACI ship along with some decent airpower is helpful along this route.
* A submarine in your fleet is optional, but effective for helping you with distract the enemy light carrier can appear in the boss composition.
* If you bring any slow ships, you will need to speed mod them to fast.
* Air Parity on Hard LD is around 125('''TBC, rough value''') Fighter Power.
* As the SDH's core weakness remains unchanged, any Ship with a [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tanks & Marines)|DLC (T89)]] + [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank|KaMi Tank]] + [[WG42]]/[[Shipborne Model Type 4 20cm Anti-ground Rocket Launcher|T4 Mortar]] (or concentrated variant) is capable of taking her out in a single shot if it hits. Therefore it is highly recommended to set up at least one of your ships in a way that is capable of doing so.
* Falling short of that, T3 shells and night-time Tank/KaMi Double attacks can help.

|-|STF CVL Comp=
* Route: A-C-H-I-K-J-M
* '''Composition: STF: 1FBB 1 CVL 2-3 CA(V) 0-1 AV 1-2 CL + 1CL 0-1 CA(V) 3-4DD '''
* '''LBAS: 1 Base, 5 Range to boss. (Both to boss node)'''
** '''LBAS Recommendation: 1 Fighter, 3 Bombers or 4 Bombers'''
* Node C is a submarine node and H being a light surface engagement, J will feature a battleship fleet.
* Will not have to worry about air attacks.
* Speed is not a concern with this composition.
* Air Parity on Hard LD is around 125('''TBC, rough value''') Fighter Power.
* As the SDH's core weakness remains unchanged, any Ship with a [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tanks & Marines)|DLC (T89)]] + [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank|KaMi Tank]] + [[WG42]]/[[Shipborne Model Type 4 20cm Anti-ground Rocket Launcher|T4 Mortar]] (or concentrated variant) is capable of taking her out in a single shot if it hits.

With the combination of your LBAS, and a well put together fleet, it should be possible to clear the [[Supply Depot Princess]] easily even on last dance. As long as you have the Anti-installation nuke and have a means to wipe out the other units this of the battle should be cleared easily.

Once the supply depot princess has been defeated, the second boss gauge will appear and you will need to unlock the path to reach it.

'''Phase 2: Unlock the Second Boss:'''

The requirements needed will be to simply gain access to the boss (on Hard+) will require you to reach two air nodes (Node E and G) and get AS from them.

Medium and lower is suspected to only need Node E fpr completion.

* AS (for hard) on Nodes E and G. Medium (and lower?) only requires AS on Node E. For this (54/198/293/359) Fighter Power is required on C/E/M/H.
* '''Composition: CTF: 2CV 0-1CV(L)1 0-1 AV 1-3 CA(V) 0-1CL/DD + 1CL 2DD 3XX'''
* '''LBAS: On Rest or 4 Fighter Sweeps to E/G''' if falling short of Fighter Power requirements
* '''Routes: A-B-E, A-B-D-G''', with E/G being Airstrike Nodes and D being a submarine node
* Load your CV(L), CAV, and/or AV full of fighters/SPF and give the escort fleet OASW/AACI

Once the conditions of Nodes E and G are met, the path will unlock.

'''Phase 3: Defeat the enemy Carrier Task Force:'''

In this phase, you are required to kill the enemy Wo-Class Kai 7 Times on Hard to clear the map. She herself is not particularly tanky or threatening , but is escorted by a BB Water Demon capable of soaking a lot of Damage as well as a CVL and some other light surface units.

CTF is the most preferred method to taking care of this segment . The path along the way will mainly have light ended ships but towards the end you'll face off against an enemy CVL unit before reaching the boss.

However, if you wish to reuse the same ships you want to use from Phase 1 & 2 you can resort an STF. Which in this case you will face an battleship fight before the boss.

As noted above, the boss is not difficult due the fact the flagship is a Wo-class carrier Flagship Kai. All you will need is a well placed double attack / CVCI to defeat her. The rest of the enemies will fall easily (save [[Battleship Water Demon Kai]] so unless you have intent to farm this node for drops, clearing the map should be done with minimal effort.

Once you deplete the HP gauge and sink the flagship carrier, the map is considered complete.
