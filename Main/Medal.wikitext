=Overview=

Medals are items that can be turned in for other resources. The primary use of medals is for obtaining [[Blueprints]]. 

This is not to be confused with the [[First Class Medal]] that is obtained from clearing events on Hard Mode.

=Where to Get=
===Extra Operations===
This is the pirmary method of obtaining medals. Clearing an Extra Operation once per month will reward you with 1 medal. You can obtain a maximum of '''6 medals per month''' through this method.  

Eligible Extra Operations are:
* [[World 1#1-5|1-5]]
* [[World 1#2-5|2-5]]
* [[World 1#3-5|3-5]]
* [[World 1#4-5|4-5]]
* [[World 1#5-5|5-5]]
* [[World 1#6-5|6-5]]

It is important to note that you must clear the extra operation '''before 2359 JST on the last day of the month'''. If you are halfway through a sortie and only kill the boss after this time, you will receive no medal.

===Events===

[[Events]] typically reward medals on clearing maps beyond the first. Typically higher difficulties are more likely to reward medals and some event maps even reward more than one medal on Hard. Because the amount of medal rewards vary from event to event, please check the current event page for up to date details.

===Trade In===
[[File:Medal_Trade_In_Menu.png|thumb|right|The Trade in-menu.The left option allows you to get a Blueprint, the top one Resources, the bottom one 4 Screws and the right button cancels the action]]
Medals can be traded in for three different rewards.

# Trading in '''4''' medals for a [[Blueprint]]
# Trading in '''1''' medal for 300 {{Fuel}}{{Ammo}}{{Steel}}{{Bauxite}} and 2 {{IR}}
# Trading in '''1''' medal for 4 {{IM}}

The most common use for medals is trading in for Blueprints. For Admirals with all [[Remodel_(Mechanic)#Blueprints|blueprint remodels]] obtained, trading medals in for Improvement Materials {{IM}} can be valuable. '''Under no circumstances should you trade medals in for resources'''.
