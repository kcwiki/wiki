== Historical Information ==
The A7M3-J ''Reppū-kai ''(''Strong Gale, Modified'') is a proposed interceptor variant of the [[Reppuu (Strong Gale)|A7M2 ''Reppū'']] with an increased maximum speed of 648km/h using a 2,200hp forced-induction version of the Mitsubishi MK9 and an armament consisting of six 30mm cannons. A working prototype was never produced, as the A7M2's design documents were lost in the bombing raids of March 1944.
