=== Tips ===
Reaching node N '''7 times''' clears the map.
* You are rewarded with a certain amount of resources upon reaching node N. The value depends on whether the resource bar is depleted or not.
* The resource bar will reset at midnight at the beginning of each month.
* The map will be locked at the beginning of each month until you have completed 1-5 for the month.
* Clearing this map rewards you with '''1 [[Seasonal/Present Box 2014|Present Box]] & 75 ranking points'''. No medal.
* Double-arrow nodes (D, F, L) are Air Battle Only nodes like those first appearing in the Summer 2014 Event. Daytime combat at these nodes have two Aerial Combat phases but no shelling.
** If your fleet has no ships that can attack during Aerial Combat, you will automatically get a D Defeat (see [[Combat#Victory_Conditions|1st D Defeat condition]]) unless you enter night combat (which is just a normal night battle).
There is no Boss node in this map. Instead you will receive a random amount of resources of either Fuel, Ammo, Steel, or Bauxite at the node with the Anchor symbol.
*Because Node N (the node after node B and D) is the End Node, you may advance with a heavily damaged ship (taiha) from node B or D without risk of sinking any of your ships.
**An exception would be when the flagship is heavily damaged. However, if the flagship is equipped with either [[Repair Team]] or [[Repair Goddess]], the player may choose to use it and continue. (There are reports that the item is not consumed if used this way?)
**Because Node N is not considered to be a boss node, it will not count towards certain quests (namely [[Quests#Bw1|Bw1]]) that requires you to reach a boss node.
*Using BBV, CA, CVL will take you to node C which leads to a route with harder enemies such as Flagship Wo-class and Flagship Ru-class. Submarine fleets with line ahead formation also appears at node I (3 out of 6 patterns).
**Generally speaking, the route through C is only taken if a player wishes to brute-force the map.
*The other route (A -> E -> G -> F -> B -> N) has 3 battles total.
**Node E is Submarine Node with Echelon formation. Because this node is so minor in nature, bringing Anti-Submarine equipments is not required.
**Node F is air-battle only.
***Having a ship with Anti-Air Cut-In equipment setup is highly recommended to reduce damage taken at node F. 
***This node creates a dilemma for players as most fleets coming through this way have no air attack and so must take a defeat unless night battle is undertaken here (which consumes ammo and can be risky).
***You can bring either 2 AV or Akitsu Maru + CAV to have a chance at avoiding defeat at Node F, but this fleet can go from G to K which is hard for a light fleet.

<br/>'''Branching rules:'''
* The following ship types are not allowed on this map: (F)BB, CV, CLT, SS(V)
* You may only use BBV, CA(V), CVL, AV, CL, DD, [[Akitsumaru]], [[Katori]], [[Kashima]], [[Akashi]], and [[Taigei]].
**Using BBV, CA, CVL will take you to node C which leads to a route with harder enemies such as Flagship Wo-class and Flagship Ru-class. Submarine fleets with line ahead formation also appears at node I (3 out of 6 patterns).
***Generally speaking, the route through C is only taken if a player wishes to brute-force the map or completing very specific quests that involve using ships that are not just 1 CL , 5 DD.
**The other route (A -> E -> G -> F -> B -> N) has 3 battles total.
***Node E is a submarine node with Echelon formation. Because this node is so minor in nature, bringing ASW equipment is not required.
***Node F is an Air Battle node only.
***Having a ship with Anti-Air Cut-In equipment setup is highly recommended to reduce damage taken at node F. 
****This node creates a dilemma for players as most fleets coming through this way have no air attack and so must take a defeat unless night battle is undertaken here (which consumes ammo and can be risky).
***You can bring either 2 AV or Akitsu Maru + CAV to have a chance at avoiding defeat at Node F, but this fleet can go from G to K which is hard for a light fleet.

<br/>'''Additional Notes'''
* Node E is a good place for players above Level 80 HQ to complete [[Quests#Bd8|Bd8]] (Sink 6 Submarines) and [[Quests#Bw5|Bw5]] (Sink 15 Submarines).
* Equipping a damecon (Repair Team) onto your flagship might be a good idea if by some chance the flagship takes heavy damage at node B, since it allows you to advance to the end node (Node N). Since the damecon is only used upon entering the next fight it'll remain in your inventory upon completing the stage.
<br/>'''Recommended Fleet'''
*'''1 CL 5 DD''' routes '''A-E-G-F-B-N'''
**The only composition that guarantees A -> E -> G -> F -> B -> N. 
**However this fleet will not be able to fight back at node F, so expect your win rate to go down slightly.
**You can also use '''6 DD / 2 CL + 4 DD / Akitsu Maru + CAV + 4 DD / 2 AV + 4 DD / 2 AO + 4 DD''' as you maybe able to get B Victory at Node F with these fleets, but these can off-route G -> K.
*'''2 BBV 1 CL 3 DD''' routes '''C-H-K-M-J-D-N'''
**Should only be used for some quests such as '''Bq3'''
**Goes through a longer and much more dangerous route compared to the light fleet route above
**There is an LoS check at node M. You need to have '''LoS F33 Cn3 > 30''' in order to go M -> J
