===Analysis===
'''Shigure Kai'''

Priority: '''Low'''

:At first remodel, she has low firepower and a decent torpedo stat, making her hitting harder in night battle than at day, but not great at either.
:While not impressive in combat, do keep in mind than many maps require you to bring at least a few destroyers for routing.
:Furthermore, destroyers are cheap to deploy and can equip [[Drum Canister]], making them suited for expeditions.


'''Shigure Kai Ni''' 

Priority: '''High'''
:Her second remodel increases most of her combat stats, making her more capable in surface battles and allowing her to perform OASW with proper gear.
:She also reaches an excellent 50 luck, which means she can use night cut-in attacks reliably.

====Recommended Roles====
* Surface combat (Second remodel)
* ASW (Second remodel)
* Night battle (Second remodel)

===Important Information===
* A22, A44, A67, A68, A82, B14, B33, B61, B68, B121, and F78

==In-game Trivia==
*On 2013/10/16 she recieved her Resupply and Idle lines were added.
*On 2013/10/23 she recieved her Kai Ni form.
**The date Shigure recieved her Kai Ni is 69 years after the [[:wikipedia:Battle of Leyte Gulf|Battle of Leyte Gulf]] took place. It is speculated that the developers chose this date on purpose.
**Unlike [[Yuudachi]] Kai Ni's historical achievement upgrade, Shigure Kai Ni's upgrade is based on the historical ship from one month before she sank. 
**[[Yuudachi]] Kai Ni and Shigure Kai Ni both have similar dog ear-shaped hair, but [[Yuudachi]]'s was based on a mad dog, while Shigure's was based on a obedient dog.
* She received the most Anti Aircraft armaments among the [[:category:Shiratsuyu Class|Shiratsuyu Class]], resulting in her strong Anti-Air stats.
** This is a historical reference to Operation Kon and the [[:wikipedia:Battle of the Philipine Sea|Battle of the Philippine Sea]].
* She is sometimes paired with [[Yamashiro]] as a couple because Yamashiro provided cover (and sunk as a result) for Shigure to escape the ''Battle of Leyte Gulf''.
* Because of her equipment's appearance, she is nicknamed 'Guncannon' (from Mobile Suit Gundam).
* Some teitokus suggest that Shigure might have PTSD over night battles, judging by her quotes.
** According to the history, both the [[:wikipedia:Battle of Vella Gulf|Battle of Vella Gulf]] and the Battle of Leyte Gulf), in which she lost all of her comrades, occurred during night time.
*Shigure's hairpin is a similar design to those on the flight decks of [[Fusou]] and [[Yamashiro]]. 
**Shigure's hairpin seems to be their hairpins put together to form one.
* Her name means ''drizzling rain'' (in late autumn and early winter).
* She shares a captain (Tameichi Hara) with both [[Amatsukaze]] and [[Yahagi]]. Captain Hara was the only IJN Destroyer Captain from the start of the war to survive to the very end.
* Her Captain's Interest was on Radar Fire Control & Avoiding Enemy Fire At Night Battle.
* Shigure was known as one of the lucky ships of the war, sometimes referred to as ''Shigure of Sasebo'', similarly as ''[[Yukikaze]] of Kure''.
** She participated in at least ten major Pacific Theater battles, in which she always suffered from medium to no damage, until she was sunk a few months before the end of the war from a torpedo attack.
***  During the [[wikipedia:Battle_of_Vella_Gulf|Battle of Vella Gulf]], she was the only destroyer to survive from the surprise torpedo salvos because the torpedo that hit her did not explode.
*** During the [[wikipedia:Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf|Battle of Leyte Gulf]], she pulled through hails of shell in front, while the rest of [[Quests#A44|Nishimura Force]] was sunk. Then she fled and became the sole survivor.
*** During the [[wikipedia:Operation_Hailstone|Operation HailStone]], She suffered heavy damage from an air raid on Truk by United States Navy aircraft, taking a direct bomb hit to her No.2 gun turret,reducing her maximum speed to 25 knots.
** This led her to have very high luck after her second remodel, though this is slightly lower than that of [[Yukikaze|''Yukikaze'']].
*Shigure used to be a concert vessel for [[Unryuu]]. In one of [[Unryuu]] kai's hourlies, she mentions Shigure bringing her riceballs and pickled radish.
*Sunk in action 7:15(JST) 24 January 1945 near [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kota_Bharu Kota Bharu], Malaya (now Malaysia) at ([http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Japanese_destroyer_Shigure&params=06_00_N_103_48_E_ 06°00′N 103°48′E]).
