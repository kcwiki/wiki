==Introduction==
金剛型高速戦艦「榛名」の前部主砲の最終形態です。<br>あまり効果がなかったといわれていますが、縦縞ゼブラ模様のダズル迷彩を施しています。<br>三式弾を装填して敵機が跳梁する空を睨み、母港呉と動けない残存艦隊の防戦に努めました。 

The final version of the Kongou-class fast battleship Haruna's forward battery.<br>
Although it was of questionable efficacy, the turret was given a zebra striped pattern dazzle camouflage.<br>
Loaded with the Type 3 shell and facing the skies dominated by enemy aircraft, it did it's best to defend the remaining fleet trapped in Kure Harbour.

==Notes==
Unbuildable. Stock equipment of [[Haruna#Second Upgrade|Haruna Kai Ni]].
