==Ship Bonuses (Tentative)==

{{:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/E-2/Historical_Ships}}

===General Overview===

* It is recommended to have the event quest completed which unlocks the Strike Force for fleet 3.
* This map utilizes the {{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag3}}{{ToolTip|[Blue Tag]|'''2nd Special Squadron'''}} and {{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag4}}{{ToolTip|[Green Tag]|'''Force H'''}}
* The LBAS Location will change once Phase 1 is completed. Refer to the LBAS Range map for the changes in combat radius before and after Phase 1.
{{Warning|message= {{color|black|On E-3, '''regardless of chosen difficulty''', fleets containing ships tagged {{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag4}}{{ToolTip|[Green Tag]|'''Force H'''}} '''cannot''' participate in Phase 3 and Phase 4 bosses due to branching rules.<br>Please keep this in mind even if planning to clear E-3 on '''Casual/Easy/Medium'''.}} }}

==Phase 1: TP Phase to relocate Land Base to Malta==

<tabber>
|-|Light Fleet Composition (Recommended) =
{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag3}}{{ToolTip|[Blue Tag]|'''2nd Special Squadron'''}} Single/Striking Force Fleet:  '''4-7 DD, 0-3 XX (Fast)'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|1||A/B|red|C|red|D|red|F|green|I|red}}
** {{MapRoute|A|red|}} if fleet contains [[Akitsu_Maru|Akitsu Maru]] or SS(V), {{MapRoute|B|Red}} otherwise
* Fleet must '''pass LoS''' to reach {{MapRoute|I|}}
* Fleet must be '''FAST'''
* Fleet must contain '''0 CV(L/B)+(F)BB(V)+CA(V)'''
|-|Medium Fleet Composition =
{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag3}}{{ToolTip|[Blue Tag]|'''2nd Special Squadron'''}} Single/Striking Force Fleet: '''1 CVL or (F)BB(V), 3-6 DD, 0-3 XX'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|1|blue|A|red|C|red|D1|red|E|blue|G|red|F|green|I|red}} 
* Fleet must '''pass LoS''' to reach {{MapRoute|I|}}
* '''XX cannot be CV(L/B)/(F)BB(V)'''
</tabber>
LBAS
* Range = 4
** Range = 3 (After clearing TP Phase)
* AP/AS = 93/207 (HARD)
Strategic Notes:
* It is recommended to send all LBAS with multiple bombers to the boss.
* Do not worry about achieving S-Rank at the boss on harder difficulties; instead, focus on a large amount of TP per A-Rank.
* PT-Imps are present at {{MapRoute|B|red}}. Vanguard Formation can make it easy to pass by without much damage.

Once the TP phase is complete, the land base will be relocated to Malta.

Strategic Notes:
* Note: The Summer Harbor Princess is an installation. Anti-installation [[Combat/Anti-Installation#Equipment_Setups|double attack setups]] are recommended to defeat this boss, as nuke setups are not effective against it.
* {{MapRoute|W|red}} contains an Airfield Princess (only on higher difficulties), PT-Imps, and Artillery Imps. Equip accordingly.

==Phase 2.5: Unlock Node {{MapRoute|Z|red}} ==

To unlock the 3rd boss, {{MapRoute|Z|red}}, you need to :

{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag3}}{{ToolTip|[Blue Tag]|'''2nd Special Squadron'''}} Striking  Force Fleet: '''0-1 CVL or (F)BB(V), 0-3 CA(V), 0-3 AV, 0-3 CL(T), 3-5 DD'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|1||A|red|C|red|D1|red|E|blue|G|red}} / {{MapRoute|H|blue}}
** {{MapRoute|E|blue}} is a choice node. The player can choose to either go to {{MapRoute|G|red}} or {{MapRoute|H|blue}} for both the requirements.
* Fleet must contain '''1 of CVL, (F)BB(V), or CA(V)'''
** Alternatively, '''Slow fleet or exactly 3 DD'''
Strategic Notes:
* LBAS: Either send LBAS to {{MapRoute|D1|red}} (range = 3) to assist with passing or set them up as LBAS Defense for the air defense unlock requirement
* Note: The same fleet can be used to complete all 3 requirements in 2-3 different sorties.

==Phase 3: Eliminate the Mediterranean Fleet at {{MapRoute|Z|red}} ==

The final boss at {{MapRoute|Z|red}} can only be reached from starting point {{MapRoute|2|}}.

<tabber>
|-|Light STF Composition=
{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag4}}{{ToolTip|[Green Tag]|'''Force H'''}} STF: '''1 CV(L/B), 2-4 CL, 1-3 DD, 0-2 CA(V) + 1 CL, 2-5 DD, 0-3 CA(V)/CLT (FAST)'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|2||J|blue|L|red|N|red|P|blue|X|purple|Z|red}}
* Fleet must be '''FAST'''
* Fleet must '''pass LoS''' to route {{MapRoute|X|purple|Z|red}}
* Fleet must include '''≥3 CL'''
* Fleet must include '''≥6 DD'''
* '''No (F)BB(V)''' allowed
* This method sacrifices a heavier fleet to allow more damage-dealing equipment to be brought to battle while still '''avoiding node''' {{MapRoute|O|red}}
* Due to the high air-power at the boss and the limit on CV(L/B), equipping 1 or more CAVs as SPF-mules may be required to reach the desired air-state
|-|Fast+ CTF Composition=
{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag4}}{{ToolTip|[Green Tag]|'''Force H'''}} CTF: '''4 CV(L/B), 1 CL, 1 XX + CL, 2 DD, 0-2 FBB, 0-1 CVL, 0-3 XX (FAST+)'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|2||J|blue|L|red|N|red|P|blue|X|purple|Z|red}}
* Fleet must be '''FAST+'''
* Fleet must '''pass LoS''' to route {{MapRoute|X|purple|Z|red}}
* Fleet must contain '''≥2 CL''' to avoid {{MapRoute|O|red}} which contains Installations and PT-Imps
* Allows as heavy of a fleet as desired
</tabber>

LBAS
* Range = 1
* Pre-LD: AD/AP/AS = 46/92/207 (Hard)
* It is recommended to send all LBAS to the Boss node {{MapRoute|Z|red}}
Shared Strategic Notes:
* It is highly recommended to use bombers with historical bonuses on your carriers due to their significant damage modifier against the boss. Please refer to the [[Summer_2021_Event/E-2/Historical_Ships|equipment bonuses chart]] from the bonuses section.

==Phase 3.5: Debuff==

There are 5 requirements needed to debuff the boss after reaching Last Dance.

Method #2: {{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag4}}{{ToolTip|[Green Tag]|'''Force H'''}} STF: 1 CV(B), 2 CA(V), 2 CL, 1 DD + 1 CL, 5 DD
* Route: {{MapRoute|2||J|blue|L|red|N|red|P|blue|X|purple|Y|red}}

LBAS
* Range = 2
* No enemy air present
* Either Toukai/ASW sweep to node {{MapRoute|Y|red}} to S-Rank it or send normal LBAS to {{MapRoute|O|red}} or {{MapRoute|N|red}} to help reach the node.
Strategic Note:
* Node {{MapRoute|Y|red}} is a submarine node which contains a Submarine Princess. Equip accordingly.
* ANY fleet that can reach {{MapRoute|Z|red}} and '''fail the LoS check''' will reach {{MapRoute|Y|red}}
** It is possible to change the loadout from chipping to reduce LoS without swapping any ships.
* A+ rank {{MapRoute|X|purple}} can also be done at the same time.
|-|Node X=
Any composition that can reach {{MapRoute|Y|red}} or {{MapRoute|Z|red}} will pass through this node and can be done in the same sortie.
* It is recommended to use the Node Support Expedition as this node can contain a Re-Class BB
</tabber>

==Finishing the Mediterranean Fleet at {{MapRoute|Z|red}} ==

Now that the debuff has been applied, there are 4 main options available for finishing off the boss.

<tabber>
|-|Fast+ CTF Composition=
{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag4}}{{ToolTip|[Green Tag]|'''Force H'''}} CTF: '''4 CV(L/B), 1 CL, 1 XX + CL, 2 DD, 0-2 FBB, 0-1 CVL, 0-3 XX (FAST+)'''

* This method sacrifices a heavier fleet to allow more damage-dealing equipment to be brought to battle while still '''avoiding node''' {{MapRoute|O|red}}
* Due to the high air-power at the boss and the limit on CV(L/B), equipping 1 or more CAVs as SPF-mules may be required to reach the desired air-state

LBAS
* Range = 1
* LD: AD/AP/AS = 92/184/414 (Hard)
* It is recommended to send all LBAS to the Boss node {{MapRoute|Z|red}}
Shared Strategic Notes:
* It is highly recommended to use bombers with historical bonuses on your carriers due to their significant damage modifier against the boss. Please refer to the [[Summer_2021_Event/E-2/Historical_Ships|equipment bonuses chart]] from the bonuses section.
* Destroying the boss will rely largely on TCIs.
** Certain historicals may be necessary for clearing E-3 on harder difficulties; use with caution!
** Some ships with Historical bonuses (primarily CLs & CAs) may be able to reach sufficient damage with DA setups
