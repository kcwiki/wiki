[[File:Marriage.jpg|thumb|300px|Marriage Ceremony]]
'''Marriage (ケッコンカッコカリ, lit. Provisional Marriage)''' was introduced with the [[Game_Updates/2014/February_14th|14th February 2014 Update]]. This mechanic allows you to marry ship girls to increase their abilities.

=Overview=

To marry a ship girl, the following requirements need to be fulfilled:
* The girl must be level 99
* You must have a [[Shop#Special_Corner|Wedding Ring and Documents]] '''in the inventory'''.
** It is important to remember to take any rings your purchase out of the special inventory first or they cannot be used.
** You can recieve one ring for free by [[#Marriage Quests|completing the quests below]].
** More rings can be purchased from the [[Shop]] for 700 points each.

===Gameplay Effects===

# Raises the level cap of the ship girl to 175.
#* This allows anti-submarine {{ASW}}, line of sight {{LOS}} and evasion {{Evasion}} to continue increasing according to each ship girl's [[Stats#Linear_Growth|stat growth]] value.
#* The [[Repairs#Repair_time|repair time]] will increase as a consequence of higher levels. 
#* Level is increased from 99 to 100 upon marriage.
# Bonus +3~6 luck {{Luck}}.
#* This bonus will not go over the ship girl's hard luck cap. 
# [[Supply_(Mechanic)#Resupplying|Consumption]] of fuel {{Fuel}} and ammo {{Ammo}} is reduced by 15%.
#* This does not affect bauxite {{Bauxite}} consumption when replenishing planes.
# Max HP is increased. Please see table below for details.
#* This cannot exceed her HP cap. 
#* The HP bonus is fixed according to remodel and does not carry over. I.e. marrying Bismarck Base/Kai will not get her to 101HP upon remodel to Zwei/Drei.
# [[Gun Fit Bonuses|Overweight fit penalties]] is reduced by 40% '''only for battleships'''.

[[File:Married_Banner.jpg|thumb|150px|Wedding ring appears on bottom right.]]
# An animated sakura petal shower effect will appear behind the married ship girl at the [[Home Port]] menu when she is the secertary ship.
# A wedding ring icon will appear on her card and banner.
# Her name will have a pink tint on the [[Composition]] menu.
# She will get an additional secretary voice line.

===Additional Notes===

* You can rewatch the marriage cinematic at any time from the [[Libary]] menu.
** Note that only the remodel you married will have the cinematic available. I.e. Marrying Kongou Kai Ni will not allow you to view the cinematic for Kongou Base/Kai.
* Marriage will not change the minimum and maximum stats of a ship girl.
* Morale and resupply status do not change on marriage.
** HP will get replenished because of the increase.
