===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''
: She is a slightly below average combat destroyer at Kai that doesn't have anything special to set her apart from the rest. This doesn't improve by much with her Zwei remodel. She does gain some survivability but it still doesn't make up for her shortcomings.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat

====Not Recommended Roles====
* ASW

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''
: She is just an average destroyer at Kai that doesn't have anything to set her apart from the rest. Her strength lies in her ASW which allows her to hit OASW easily. That said, her rarity and abundance of easier to obtain OASW destroyers make her not a priority.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''High'''
: She has average firepower but an excellent torpedo stat that almost makes up for it. This puts her among the bottom ranks of combat destroyers. Her high luck makes her a good choice as a backup torpedo cut in destroyer. Her high ASW and ability to perform OASW by default at Kai makes her a great pick to deal with subs. It also means she is able to perform single slot OASW at Kai regardless of her ASW stat.

* Combat
* ASW

===Analysis===
Priority: '''High'''
: She has great firepower but is hurt by her below average torpedo stat. She makes up for that by being the only 4-slot destroyer in the game. When combined with her high luck, it makes her another good candidate for a backup torpedo cut in destroyer. Her high ASW allows her to hit OASW before marriage and her 4 slots allow her to take full advantage of ASW synergy bonuses.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''
: She has below average combat and survivability stats. Unlike other destroyers, she is also slow. This can potentially cause problems with routing but can be fixed with a Reinforcement Expansion. Where she shines is her high ASW stat and ability to perform OASW by default at Kai. Although she has high luck, she doesn't have the combat ability to take advantage of it.

====Recommended Roles====
* ASW

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Combat

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Medium'''
: She has above average firepower but is let down by her low torpedo stat. She does have excellent ASW and a great AACI with high fixed shootdown and good multipliers. She is also able to perform OASW by default at Kai. Along with her high luck, it makes her an excellent "swiss army knife" ship that can fill any role in a pinch. Do note that her AACI requires two [[5inch Naval Gun Mk.30 Kai + GFCS Mk.37]] to bring out her full potential. She does lose out in raw stats to more specialised destroyers but she will serve you well whenever you need a multi-role ship.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* ASW
* Anti-air
