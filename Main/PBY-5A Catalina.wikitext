==Introduction==
「カタリナ」の愛称で親しまれた傑作飛行艇です。信頼性の高い水陸両用機で、哨戒から救難まで幅広く運用されました。<br>
戦後も活躍した傑作機のひとつです。

Nicknamed “Catalina” this was a wonderfully designed flying boat.  It was widely used for patrol and rescue operations. 
 
Even after the end of the war, this masterpiece of a machine saw continued usage.

*Can only be equipped by [[Akitsushima]] (and [[Akitsushima#Upgrade|her remodel]]).
*Will launch during aerial battle if other planes are launched, but cannot start aerial battle on its own.
*Capable of performing ASW on its own (similar to [[Ka-type Observation Autogyro]]).
*Increases the range of [[Land-Based Air Support]] planes by 2.
