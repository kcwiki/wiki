==Gameplay Notes==
===Special Mechanics===
* Able to perform special AACI on Kai Ni. Please see [[Anti-Air Cut-In]] for more details.
* Able to equip torpedoes and perform closing torpedo at Kai Ni C.
* Able to equip seaplane bombers at Kai Ni C.
* She gains a '''night battle''' special attack on Kai Ni C that targets 2 enemies at random: 
** Activation requirements are as follows:  
*** Kongou Kai Ni C must be Flagship.
*** Hiei Kai Ni C, Haruna Kai Ni or Warspite are the second ship.
*** She must not be more than <span style="color:gold;">'''lightly damaged (小破)'''</span>.
*** The escorting BB must not be <span style="color:red;">'''heavily damaged (大破)'''</span>.
*** '''Line Ahead''' needs to be selected in a single fleet OR '''Cruising Formation 4''' for a combined fleet.
** It can only be activated '''once per sortie''' and only if '''no other special attack was triggered in the same sortie'''
** The attack will consume extra ammo from both participating battleships when triggered. The total ammo consumption will be x1.3 of the original ammo consumption of when the attack is triggered, hence:
***If it is triggered in day battle, it costs 6% extra ammo.
***If it is triggered in an night battle node, it costs 2% extra ammo.
***If it is triggered in a night battle in a normal node, it costs 9% extra ammo.
** Multipliers and activation chance increase are TBD at this point

{{clear}}

'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''
* She has accuracy bonuses and penalties when equipped with certain large guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
'''Kongou Kai'''

Priority: '''High''', unless many more fast battleships are available.

:A Japanese fast battleship that's easy to come across for her class.
:Her stats are decent but nothing to write home about.



'''Kongou Kai Ni'''

Priority: '''Low'''

:This second remodel improves her stats a bit and that's it.
:There's no reason not to take it but no reason to rush it either, generally.



'''Kongou Kai Ni C'''  

Priority: '''Low'''
:This further remodel comes with a torpedo fitting, allowing her to equip torpedoes and perform closing salvos like cruisers or destroyers, and also increasing her night battle potential. 
:She also unlock a special night battle combined attack, which further underscores her new niche.
:Keep in mind that this remodel requires 2 [[Blueprint]]s.


====Recommended Roles====
* Surface combat
* Night battle (Second remodel C)

===Important Info===
* Required for unlocking the 4th fleet slot.
* Required for quests A16 and A40
