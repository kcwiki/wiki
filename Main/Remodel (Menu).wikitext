**The target ship must be eligible to equip the saved equipment in the same slots as the preset. (e.g. no gun in slot three when deploying onto Ise-Class Kai Ni, no gun in slot 4 when deploying onto Yuubari Kai Ni). This also applies to special rule reinforcement expansion equipment like 8cm HA guns and bulges.
**The equipment must be in the inventory and not equipped on another ship

* There are two modes to deploying presets:
** Mode A: Picks the best of the available equipment saved in the preset (based on akashi improvements)
