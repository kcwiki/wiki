===Analysis===
Priority: '''Medium'''

: She is a good and cheap ship when you need OASW. Beyond that, her combat stats are terrible. Her ability to hit OASW early makes her invaluable for submarine only maps. Her low defensive stats means she will have trouble surviving against ships heavier than a destroyer. Her other important use is for modernising luck, ASW and HP. She, along with the other DEs, are the only ships in game capable of modernizing ASW and HP. This makes her invaluable for helping other ships hit the critical OASW and 4n+3 HP thresholds. Another potential use for her is for expeditions because she is so cheap to run and can be sparkled with minimal effort in 1-5.
