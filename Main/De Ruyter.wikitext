'''Hidden Fit Bonuses'''

She has accuracy and firepower bonuses when equipped with certain medium guns. Please see [[Gun Fit Bonuses]] for mode details.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''

:A Dutch light cruiser. At first remodel, she has good Firepower but bad Torpedo stat for a light cruiser, meaning she can do [[Artillery Spotting]] effectively at day but won't hit much hard at night.
:Unlike most other light cruisers, her ASW stat is low.

:No further remodels have been implemented for her yet (as of January 2020).


====Recommended Roles====
* Surface combat
