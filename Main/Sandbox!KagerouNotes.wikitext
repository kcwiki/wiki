===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''
: She is just an average destroyer at Kai that doesn't have anything to set her apart from the rest
: Her Kai Ni gives her the ability to equip medium bulges and a significant increase to her firepower and torpedo stats. She becomes one of the stronger combat DDs in the game in this remodel but does not have any additional utility. Overall she's low priority because she also needs a blueprint to remodel.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat

===Important Information===
* Required for A32, A87, A88, B21, B116, and B117.
* An option for C15 and C21.
* Comes with a [[12.7cm Twin Mount Type-C Kai 2]] on Kai Ni

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Low'''
: She is just an average destroyer at Kai that doesn't have anything to set her apart from the rest
: Her Kai Ni gives her the ability to equip medium bulges, Fleet Command Facilities and a significant increase to her firepower and torpedo stats. She becomes one of the stronger combat DDs in the game in this remodel. She does not have any special utility outside of this however so is outperformed by other top DDs when factoring cost. Overall she's low priority because she also needs a blueprint to remodel.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Medium/Low'''
: She is just an average destroyer at Kai that doesn't have anything to set her apart from the rest
: She gains the ability to equip medium bulges and type 2 tanks on kai ni. In addition to this she also gains a significant increase to her combat stats most notably her firepower which coupled with the Kagerou class fit bonuses make her the strongest double attack anti-installation destroyer. Overall she is slightly weaker than Kagerou and Shiranui in combined firepower + torpedo but makes up for this with her additional utility.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat
* Anti-Installation

===Important Information===
* Required for A88 and B117.
* An option for C15 and C21.
* Comes with a [[12.7cm Twin Mount Type-C Kai 2]] +5 on Kai Ni
* Comes with a [[Type 3 Depth Charge]] +5 on Kai Ni

===Analysis===
Priority: '''High'''
: Good combat stats and a very high luck stat plus low remodel level makes Yukikaze one of the most important destroyers for a new player. She is more or less a better Shigure Kai Ni and should be one of the first torpedo cut-in ships obtained.

* Combat

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Medium'''
: She is just an average destroyer at Kai that doesn't have anything to set her apart from the rest
: Their D kai remodels turn them into some of the best asw destroyers in the game. Otherwise they're not that particularly notable though their remodel levels are fairly low.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Medium/Low'''
: She is just an average destroyer at Kai that doesn't have anything to set her apart from the rest
