The '''"Early" Autumn 2018 Event''', '''"Set Sail! Combined Fleet, to the West"''' is scheduled to begin on the '''September 8th, 2018''', will last for 3 weeks and will serve as the first event that will be implemented with the HTML 5 release of KanColle as it enters [[Phase 2]]. 

Due to the numerous delays that have occurred, Kanmusu and Abyssals will still be dressed in their Summer Seasonal CGs since the event was originally intended to be released during the Summer.

As of current, the known details of the event is that the main operation of the event will be taking place in the '''"South Western and Western Waters"''' as your fleet makes it's way to European Waters where the Extra Operations will take place. The Extra Operations will be released on '''August 12th, 2018'''. The final battle of the Extra Operation will take place up in the far north of the European Waters.

There will be a total of 5 new ships that will be released with this event.

==Mechanics==
===Participation requirements===
*Must have a 75% sortie win ratio.
*Must have 5 empty ship slots for new ships.
*Must have 20 free equipment slots.

===Special Mechanics===
#The difficulty system first used in [[Spring 2015 Event]] returns: you can choose between Operation A ({{lang|ja|甲}}, Hard), Operation B ({{lang|ja|乙}}, Medium), Operation C ({{lang|ja|丙}}, Easy) or Operation D ({{lang|ja|丁}}, Very Easy) .
#*Choosing A or B requires certain HQ Level (HQ Lv 35 for B / 80 for A in Spring 2015 Event).
#*'''An important note''' to all Admirals intending to clear the event on Hard difficulty - further (new) conditions now apply:'''
#**When switching difficulty from ''any other difficulty'' to Hard, the map's debuff mechanism (where applicable) will be reset.
#***Switching between any other difficulties will not reset the debuff mechanism.
#The debuff system from [[Summer 2015 Event]]'s final map, where certain nodes had to be killed to reduce boss armor will return.
# Returning this event will allow a fleet with '''seven''' ships ('''[[Striking Force Fleet]]''') to sortie to certain event maps that allow '''single fleet operations''' starting from '''E-2''', and also includes the '''final''' map of the event.
#*The Striking Force '''cannot''' be sortied during exercises or sent on expeditions while it contains seven ships.
#*The Striking Force can only be created and used in the '''third''' fleet in the menu (out of a total of four fleets).
#*A Striking Force with a flagship that carries a new piece of equipment, the '''Striking Force Fleet Command Facility''', will be able to make use of the new '''Single Ship Evacuation''' mechanic.
#**The new Single Ship Evacuation mechanic that will become available for the Striking Force as of E-4 allowing a single ship in the fleet to retreat from the battlefield after an enemy engagement if she suffered heavy damage.
#***It is possible for the damage to become even worse during a Single Ship Evacuation.
#***Unlike the Combined Fleet's evacuation mechanic, it does not require an escort destroyer.
#**The new Striking Force Fleet Command Facility will become obtainable and useable via the old [[Fleet Command Facility]] and the '''Action Report''' that can be earned in the upcoming Fall Event. The [[Fleet Command Facility]], as well as the new Action Report item, will be obtainable on all difficulty levels, including Medium and Easy Mode.
#**Supplementary information regarding the new [[Striking Force Fleet Command Facility]] and the Single Ship Evacuation it allows when carried by the striking force's flagship:
#***The evacuation does not require an escort destroyer.
#***The evacuation consumes the ship's entire fuel & ammo reserves. 
#***Only one ship can be evacuated per battle.
#***'''The damage the ship suffered may become worse during the evacuation, but she will never sink.'''
#Returning this event, a new Fleet formation will be introduced called the '''Vanguard Formation'''.
#*This formation will organize the fleet such that the 3rd-6th/7th ships protect the Flagship and 2nd Ship of the Fleet.
#**In addition, the formation allows for ships to become more evasive in combat situations, especially with well-trained Destroyer.
#** This formation is also available '''only during the duration of the event.'''
#**The formation will be usable by [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/930623111862435841 both] normal fleets as well as the Striking Force Fleet.
#'''New:''' '''NPC Friend Fleets''' have been introduced into the game.
#* Friend Fleets act as another unit that appears in particular battles to help aid your fleet when attacking the enemy at the start of night battle.
#** As of current, only E-4 will allow the use of Friend Fleets at the boss node. 
#** NPC Friend Fleets are selected from a randomized preset list of ship.
#** Depending on who you have in your fleet can also influence who will be arrive to aid you in battle.

'''The following guide is an early version. While this will provide some basic info, please be careful when using it as it may still have incomplete information.'''

'''Important notice: To anyone wishing the challenge Medium or Hard Mode for E-4 (Medium/ Hard Mode locking) and E-5 (for locking on Hard Mode), it is very important to not use European ships until these segments, see E-4 and E-5 for more details'''

'''Recommended fleet:''' 2CL/CT, 3-4DE, 0-1DD. This fleet takes the shortest route to the boss. (Start Point #2->G->F->I)
<br>

It is also possible to use a 5-ship fleet (see routing restrictions above) to clear the map via the shortest route, although having one less ship in the fleet will probably affect your chances of success. A fleet of 3-6DE, 0-3DD could hypothetically also reach the boss via the same route, but the primary consideration in recommending the 2CL/CT configuration is survivability, as nodes G & F are surface combat nodes.
<br>

Vanguard Formation and node support is recommended to help your fleet reach the boss node. Line abreast is recommended for the boss node. During Last Dance, boss support (ASW) may also be useful to help deal with the other submarines in the boss fleet before your own fleet engages, especially when faced with disadvantageous engagement modifiers.

'''The following guide is an early version. While this will provide some basic info, please be careful when using it as it may still have incomplete information.'''

'''Important notice: To anyone wishing the challenge Medium or Hard Mode for E-4 (Medium/ Hard Mode locking) and E-5 (for locking on Hard Mode), it is very important to not use European ships until these segments, see E-4 and E-5 for more details'

E-2 Operation will involving organizing your fleet to complete 2 major task before completing the entire maps.

* Complete a Transport Operation
* Take out the [[Supply Depot Princess]] at Phuket

'''Complete the Transport Operation'''

'''Fleet Recommendation'''

1CA, 1CAV, 1CL, 3 DD<br>
2DD, 1CA, 1CAV, 1CVL, 1FBB

'''Path: ''' A-C-D-F-G-I

If you are playing on a Medium of hard difficulty, consider using ships that can be good in both transports and Anti-Installation combat to help out with the fight.

As like most transport operations, you will need to organize a balance between transport supplies and Combat equipment. Since this operation will involve using a single fleet it's suggested to bring at most 4 [[Drum Canister]]s or [[Daihatsu]] (preferred). 

Your CAV should have at least 1 Seaplane Fighter to ensure that you'll gain air superiority (as the Transport boss has no air power)

While moving through the nodes, use the Vanguard formation to improve your chances of survival until reaching the boss node.

The boss fleet will consist of a [[Heavy Cruiser Princess]] along with a few CAs and DDs. Using an LBAS full of Land Base Bombers is recommended to take care of the enemies on this boss fight there fore the following LBAS should be considered:

'''Recommended LBAS'''

4 Land Base Bombers/ Torpedo Bombers

If your fleet is capable enough they should gain score consistent A or S ranks at the boss node clearing this map easily.

'''Defeating the [[Supply Depot Princess]]'''

'''Fleet Recommendation'''

1 CV, 1CA, 1CAV, 3 DD<br>
1FBB, 1CAV, 1CVL, 1CV, 2DD <br>
1 CV, 1 BB(V),1 CAV, 0-1 CL, 2-3 DD


'''Path: '''D-F-E-K-M-O

In this phase your fleet will need to be armed to deal with Anti-Installation combat since the main target the operation . Because of the high air power in K and O, you will need to have a Carrier that will be equipped with only fighters (some one that isn't [[Akagi]], [[Souryuu]], [[Hiryuu]], [[Shoukaku]] and [[Zuikaku]] is preferred since they're important for E-3)

If you bring a CV + CVL, then it can be possible to consider being torpedo bombers and Dive bombers, but keep in mind that the AA strength of the enemy will be powerful through the entire may and may destroy your planes. 

All your CA(V)s, and (F)BB(V) should be armed with [[Type 3 Shell]] to help battle against the [[Supply Depot Princess]] at the boss nodes.

For weaker FBBs you may consider AP shells if you need a way to pick off [[Artillery Imp]]s if you're lacking in Anti-Installation gear.

As for your CL and DDs, use a combination of [[WG42]]s, [[Daihatsu]], [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tanks & Marines)]], and [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank]]s to stack up the multiplier you can do against Installations.

Do remember that:
* [[WG42]] can be stacked on one another
* Using 2 of the same Daihatsu type gear will not stack the multiplier (I.E. 2 [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank]] will not boost it's effects)
*Using separate Daihatsu type equipment will add to the multiplier (I.E Using a [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank]] and a [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tanks & Marines)]] will add to the multiplier.

The most ideal set up for a very stong anti-installation attack from a DD is [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank]], [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tanks & Marines)]] and [[WG42]]. The more modified the equipment is, the stronger the results can be. 

Using this set up can be super effective in severely or instant killing the [[Supply Depot Princess]] in a single hit.

If you are lacking in some of the above mention gear for your CL/ DD consider spreading at least on of the above mention gear among your DD and CL and use 2 guns on them, while this set up isn't nearly as strong, it's will likely hit result in suitable damage against the boss.

On route to the boss use, [[Vanguard Formation]] to protect your fleet if you're using a more lighter fleet, but if you're using a more heavier fleet, using Line head can be a possible option.

There will be an Air Attack node with the [[Supply Depot Princess]] along with some [[Airfield Princess]], use diamond formation and if you bring a DD with AACI, your chances of survival should improve.

At the boss node, you will face the Vacation Mode [[Supply Depot Princess]] along with some [[Artillery Imp]]s, a DD and a transport. 

On Harder difficulties it's possible for an [[Airfield Princess]] to appear in the composition as well.

Using an LBAS with an effective set up can help clear out some of the enemies as well as the [[Artillery Imp]]s that may block your way.

'''Recommended LBAS'''

1 Fighter/Land Base Fighter, 3 Land Base Bombers/ Torpedo Bombers

Keep in mind that due to the presence of [[Artillery Imp]]s they may be able to knock out your LBAS's ranks easily and while this may not be a problem for farming or pre-final kill, the boss kill may present some problems as the being able to eliminate as many of the enemies as possible is needed to help improve your odds of success when delivering the final kill on the [[Supply Depot Princess]]

If an [[Airfield Princess]] is present on the final kill, try to make sure your fleet's air power + AACI is strong enough to wipe out all the bombers so you can fully disable her during day battle to make the fight easier and more possible to efficiently defeat the [[Supply Depot Princess]] once all enemy ships are eliminated.

Support Shelling fleets for both in-route and Boss node are recommend to ensure you will survive your trip and improve your odds of success.

'''The following guide is an early version. While this will provide some basic info, please be careful when using it as it may still have incomplete information.'''

'''Important notice: To anyone wishing the challenge Medium or Hard Mode for E-4 (Medium/ Hard Mode locking) and E-5 (for locking on Hard Mode), it is very important to not use European ships until these segments, see E-4 and E-5 for more details'''

'''Historical Ships'''
*CV(L/B):  [[Akagi]], [[Hiryuu]], [[Shoukaku]], [[Souryuu]], [[Zuikaku]], [[Ryuujou]], [[Suzuya]], [[Kumano]]
*(F)BB(V): [[Haruna]], [[Hiei]], [[Kirishima]], [[Kongou]]
*CA(V): [[Choukai]], [[Kumano]], [[Mikuma]], [[Mogami]], [[Suzuya]]
*CL: [[Yura]], [[Abukuma]]
*DD: [[Arare]], [[Akigumo]], [[Hamakaze]], [[Isokaze]], [[Kagerou]], [[Kasumi]], [[Shiranui]], [[Tanikaze]], [[Urakaze]], [[Amagiri]], [[Fubuki]], [[Hatsuyuki]], [[Murakumo]], [[Shirayuki]]
'''Historical may not be 100% confirmed especially the unconventional DDs'''

'''Phase 3 Boss bonuses'''

* Historical Ships: 1.2x
*SPF/SPB: 1.3x
*T3 Shell: 1.35x
*DB: 1.4x
*2DB. 2.1x

Phase 1: Sink [[Summer Harbor Princess]]

The goal of phase 1 is to sink [[Summer Harbor Princess]] either using a single fleet or a Surface Task Force. The boss in this phase is an installation so the usage of T3 shells and WG are advised. (need confirmation about T89 and Ka Mi tanks).

Composition
*  1 FBB 1 CV 1-2 CAV 2-3 DD
*  2 FBB 1 CAV 1 CV 2 DD + 1 CL 2 DD 2 CLT 1 CAV (can we get confirmation on if using CAs instead of DDs work?)
A single fleet allows you to conserve additional ships from being locked at the cost of requiring node support to reliability pass '''J''' node. '''(Might want to note some positives, my opinion is that this is the weaker composition overall)'''

Using the Surface Task Force composition allows for you to skip the usage of node support but in return you will take an additional sub node '''K'''. This composition has a stronger performance at the boss due to the extra shelling rounds and ability to bring more installation killing ships.

Phase 2: Sink [[Anchorage Water Demon]] (Vacation Mode)

Composition
* STF: 2 (F)BB(V) 1 CV(B) 3 CA(V) + 1 CL 1-2 CA(V) 1-2 CLT 2 DD 
* CTF: 3 CV(B) 2 CA(V) 1 SS(V) + 1 CL 1-2 CA(V) 1-2 CLT 2 DD 

Notes

SSV tanking can be used to distract boss and nu
Boss in LD does not target sub anymore

Phase 3: Sink [[German Escort Princess]]
Composition
* CTF: 3 CV(B) 1 SS(V) 2 CA(V) + 1 CL 1-2 CA(V) 2 DD 1-2 CLT 0-1 CVL

This boss fight is extremely difficult due to the lack of post-cap modifiers given against the rest of the enemies on the boss node as well as the bosses extremely high armor.  

It's advised to in mind the historical and equipment post-cap modifiers granted against the boss while equipping your fleet for this battle.  

'''Any ships that do not utilize these modifiers will have trouble breaking through the armor outside of a critical, so please plan accordingly.'''

Notes

*Carriers should be equipped for Carrier CI (CVI), 1TB/2DB/1 fighter
*CAV should either be equipped with seaplane fighters (SPF) or T3 shells.
*SSV used for sub tanking enemies in the boss node and supplement air power.

'''Important Notice: '''

'''The Following map will can be taken advantage of using European ships (Italians), please read all the information carefully from E-4 and E-5 before weighing your options for who to use for this map as playing on E-5 Hard will have additional locks which you'll need enough European ships to complete the map on Hard.'''

In this Operation you will need to complete a series of steps which will involve doing various tasks based on Ooyodo's notes in order to complete this operation, these include the following:

# Complete a transport Operation to drop of '''transport supplies to North Africa (Node K) (And fight the [[Battleship Summer Princess]] (Node L)''') 
# Gain Control of the Harbors in Naples ('''Node O - [[Harbor Summer Princess]]''')
# Eliminate the Submarines to the West ('''Node R''')
# Gain Control of the Supply Depot in Taranto ('''Node S - [[Supply Depot Princess]] (Vacation Mode) (Optional, but recommend)''')
# Gain Control of the Docks at Genova and eliminate the '''[[Dock Princess]] (Node U)'''

You will also have '''3 LBAS available''' for this map but can only use 2 of them. If you are playing on Normal or Hard difficulty, you will need to set up your 3rd LBAS to do Air Defense again enemy air raids that will attack your base. 

''LBAS Recommendations'''

'''LBAS 3 - 4 Interceptors or 3 Interceptors + 1 [[Saiun]]'''

'''Transport Operation to North Africa'''

'''Recommended Fleet'''

'''Option 1: Transport Combined Fleet - ''' 1 CVL (CVE), 1 CL, 4 DD + 1 CL, 1 CA, 4 DD <br>
'''Option 2: Single Fleet - ''' 6 DD

'''Path: - D - H - I - K - L'''

As like most [[Transport Operation]]s, it's recommend to organized a fleet that can care a health balance of combat gear and Transport equipment to help complete the operation

The major things to remember when playing this map is the advantages and disadvantage of each of the fleet

'''Transport combined Fleet'''<br>
* '''+''' Will deplete transport gauge faster
* '''-''' Will however use more ships that will be tagged to this map 
* '''-''' May present possible accuracy issues and take possible damage, when fighting [[PT Imp Groups]] in Node D

'''Single Fleet''' <br>
* '''+''' Can use '''[[Vanguard Formation]]''' to evade attacks
* '''+''' Will allow you to use less ships to complete the operation
* '''-''' Will deplete TP Gauge a little slower
* '''-''' May present possible issues over at Node I due to lack of Air power if you use an all DD group

Which ever fleet type you choose be sure to remember the following:

* With a Transport Combined Fleet, you can use the main fleet to carry lots of [[Daihatsu]] and [[Drum Canister]] while your escort fleet can focus on combat.
* With a single fleet, you will need to be careful how you organize your fleet so they can meet both LoS requirements and bring still care some transport goods and reach the boss node to fight and at least secure an A rank.

Since you'll face PT imps along the way to the boss, consider bringing AA guns if you use a transport combined fleet or use Vanguard to survive the torpedo attacks. 

The node with the Carrier should be manageable with a CVL in a transport combined fleet, while with a single fleet you may need to vanguard you way to survive the battle. 

Once you reach the boss you'll face the [[Battleship Summer Princess]] who will be in a combined fleet. 

Depending on the difficulty she may or may not have an additional Battleship Princess during the battle, but since her entire fleet will lack in any air power, gain air superiority should be easy if you bring a CVL in your fleet, and should allow you to use a full on LBAS bomber unit to attack the boss at full force making gaining an A rank easy to do and might open for a chance for an S rank as well.

'''LBAS Recommendations'''

'''LBAS 1 & 2 - 4 LBAS Bobmers / Torpedo Bombers (Distance of 6 Required)''' 

Repeat until you successfully deplete the TP gauge which will then open up the 2nd starting point which will allow for your single fleet to do the next objectives.

With your new starting point, you will now proceed to launch an attack on Naples (Node O) and some submarine to the West (Node R)

'''Gain Control of the Harbors in Naples (Node O - [[Harbor Summer Princess]])'''

'''Recommended Fleet: Single Fleet - 2 FBB, 3 DD, 1 CV'''

'''Path: J - Q - P - O'''

In this fight, you will need to organize a fleet that can specialize in Anti-Installation Combat while maintaining strong air power as you will be going through a series of carrier battles + an air strike before reaching the boss. Bringing an AACI DD can help with clearing out some of the planes in the air attacks improving your chances of survival.

In addition to this, you may want to also bring some AA guns to help with dealing with PT imps at the Target node.

Node O will have a [[Harbor Summer Princess]] along with some CVL and some [[Artillry Imp]]s and [[PT Imp Group]]s, bringing and LBAS with a good mixuture of fighters and bombers can help reduce the air power along with allowing your bombers to bomb effiecently against the enemies present at the node. If all goes well it can be possible to wipe out the imps before the fight commences making for an easier chance at successfully completing the objective. 

'''An A rank is needed at minimum to complete the requirement.'''

'''LBAS Recommendation'''

'''LBAS 1 - 2 Fighter/ LBAS Fighters + 2 LBAS bombers (Distance 6 Needed)'''
'''LBAS 1 - 1 Fighter/ LBAS Fighters + 3 LBAS bombers (Distance 6 Needed)'''

'''Eliminate the Submarines to the West (Node R)'''

'''Recommended Fleet: Single Fleet - 2 FBB, 2 DD, 2 CV/CVL'''

'''Path: J - Q - R'''

For section, you may not need your LBAS here so consider putting them on standby or evacuate from the land base to protect them from possible damage on higher difficulties.

If possible, consider bringing your ASW CVL you may have used on the transport phase along with some pre-ASW DD and bring enough air power to overcome the air attack. Once you reach the node R, you'll have a small group of submarines to take out. All which should be easily beatable with your Pre-ASW DDs.

'''An A rank is needed at minimum to complete the requirement.'''

'''Once both Node R and O are successfully completed the path to Node S and the Boss node (through Node T) will be open'''

'''Gain Control of the Supply Depot in Taranto (Node S - [[Supply Depot Princess]] (Vacation Mode) (Optional, but recommend))'''

'''Recommended Fleet'''

'''Surface Task Force - '''2 (F)BB. 3 CA, 1 CVL + 1 CL, 5 DD

'''Path:''' A - B - D - E - F - G - S

Once again, your fleet will need to be organized to do another Anti installation assault against the [[Supply Depot Princess]] at Taranto (Node S). So remember to bring [[Type 3 Shell]], AP Shells, [[WG42]], various Daihatsu equipment and [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank]]s. Using a CVL will help you by pass the Carrier Summer Demon so that you can have your LBAS focus on concentrating all thier attacks on Node S. 

Outside of the sub fight at the start, the rest of the battles should be straight forward as you make your way to the target node. Boss itself will be a combined fleet consisting transports, destroyers, some Artillery Imps, Airfield Princesses and the Supply Depot Princess. With some decent air power and some strong LBAS you shouldn't have much of a problem wiping out the smaller units along with possibly eliminating some of the [[Artillery Imps]] and weaken down some of the installations. 

'''LBAS 1 - 1 Fighter/ LBAS Fighters + 3 LBAS bombers (Distance 5 Needed)'''
'''LBAS 2 - 4 LBAS bombers (Distance 5 Needed)'''

If possible try to eliminate at least 8 out of the 12 units to successfully score an '''A rank'''.

Once this condition is complete an alternative path to node U (Re-class Route) is then open.

'''Gain Control of the Docks at Genova and eliminate the '''[[Dock Princess]] (Node U)'''

'''Recommended Fleet Composition:''' 2 (F)BB(V), 1 CV, 1 CA, 2 DD 

'''Path:''' J - Q - W - V - U

'''Recommended Fleet Composition:''' 6 SS

'''Path:''' J - Q - T - U or J - Q - P - T - U (Depending on how many [[WG42]] and [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank]] you bring

During the final part of the operation, your fleet will have over come a series of air waves to reach the boss node and you will need a decently strong air power Carrier to help you pull through. If possible, consider CVs like [[Saratoga]] or [[Kaga]] for this operation (with the former being good to utilize with Night Planes). You Fleet will need to traverse through some carrier attacks, air strikes, and a node to fight against a [[Battleship Re-class]]. During these fights, take advantage of the Vanguard formation to hope that the enemy fleet rolls an echelon formation to maximize your chances for survival. 

Alternatively you can consider using an all Submarine fleet on this map to go through a path where you may face only some DDs and Tsu-class CLs that may pose a treat to your submarines. If you are able to by pass this you can reach the boss to easily chip away at her HP and can also be used to farm for [[Gotland]] on hard mode. 

At the boss node you will face the [[Dock Princess]] who will be accompanied by a Supply Depot Princess, a few destroyers, and a PT Imp.

During the normal phases, she will have very little air power making it possible to launch a full scale bombing strike from your LBAS making it very possible to wipe out most of the enemies at the start of the fight. However the boss is also very armored and may be difficult to break through on higher difficulty. However the [[Dock Princess]], while she is a Destroyer by code, is treated more like an installation. So the most effective means to take her down will be to use Anti-Installation Equipment. 

'''LBAS Recommendations'''

'''LBAS 1 & 2 - 4 LBAS Bobmers (Distance of 8 Required)''' 

So using CA and BBs with Type 3 shells can help and having DDs armed with the ideal combination like [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank]], [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tanks & Marines)]] and [[WG42]] can be used to help brake through her armor.

Other effective means can be using a Torpedo cut in DD with [[WG42]] to magnify the damage.

However, the most effective way to defeat the boss is by bringing in Italian ships to help aid in battle as they are giving a bonus modifier to thier attacks which can help them get through the boss's armor more efficiently.

The following modifiers are confirmed to through tests against the [[Dock Princess]]:

* Italian Ship: 1.2
* Type 3 Shell: ~1.428
* Type 2 Ka-mi Tank: 1.31 ~ 1.51
* Type 2 Ka-mi Tank (+max): 1.7 ~ 2.16
* Daihatsu-class Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tanks & Marines): 1.37 ~ 2.18
* Daihatsu-class Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tanks & Marines) (+max): 1.25 ~ 2.02
* Daihatsu: (+6): 1.22 ~ 2.11
* 11th Tank Regiment: 1.64 ~ 1.86
* WG42: 1.46 ~ 1.47
* 11th Tank + WG42 + Kami: 2.24 ~ 2.30
* 11th Tank + WG42 + Kami (+max): 2.94 ~ 3.17

By using a combination of this equipment and Italian ships you can easily meet the requirements to take down boss with a well place crit. 

On final kill, the armor of the princess will increase along with much tougher DD variants and a CVL appearing in the fleet. You can continue to use the same LBAS set up as before to deliver a devastating blow, however you are at risk of possibly losing rank during this since the CVL may be capable of destroying your planes. So if necessary retrain planes rank to improve crit chances. 

Outside of this, the boss is mostly the same and with a strong well place crits and either using Italians or proper Anti-installation equipment it may be possible to take down the princess. If you also use Italians remember that you can limit them so that only Gotland's European Fleet can come in to aid you or Des Div 31 in night battle. 

And for additional note to hard mode players, '''please be careful how many Italian ships you use as you may need to use them towards the final map.'''

''' Before entering into this map on Hard difficulty, please read the following information below as it will vital for your planning for E-1 to E-5'''

'''Planning out E-5 for Hard Difficulty'''

On E-5 the major obstacle that Hard mode players will face is additional locking requirements that none of the other difficulties have. In this operation you will be split up 2 combined fleets to form the two major fleets:

* <span style="color:Blue">'''Force H'''</span>
* <span style="color:Purple">'''Rheinübung Fleet'''</span>

Within each of the fleets you will need to organize and prepare and reserve a minimum of 24 ships you will be using in the final operation.

These include the following things:

* 4-5 (F)BB(V)
* 4-6 CA(V) 
* 2-3 CL
* 6-9 DD 
* 4-6 CV
* 1-3 CVL
* 0-1 AV
* 0-1 SS(V)
* Any additional Auxiliary ships like LHA, AOs, ect.
* At least 12 European ships (British, Italian, German, French and Russian)
** 6 for <span style="color:Blue">'''Force H'''</span> <nowiki>*</nowiki> (Low Priority due the significance of the <span style="color:Purple">'''Rheinübung Fleet'''</span>'s European ships requirements.)
** 6 for <span style="color:Purple">'''Rheinübung Fleet'''</span> (With at least 4 of them being French and German)

If you are able to meet most of the requirements then you will need to carefully weigh your options on who to bring for each segment as both <span style="color:Blue">'''Force H'''</span> and  <span style="color:Purple">'''Rheinübung Fleet'''</span> must be carefully planned out.

'''A critical mistake of using too many European ships in other maps will possibly prevent you from completing hard mode, and may result in a drop in difficulty and / or hunting for additional ships to meet the quota'''

'''Steps to completing the Operations in this map''''

The following conditions need to be completed in order move forward along the map:

# Use the Carrier Task Force (<span style="color:Blue">'''Force H'''</span> Hard Mode) to defeat the [[Battleship Summer Princess]]
# Use The Surface Task Force ( <span style="color:Purple">'''Rheinübung Fleet'''</span> Hard Mode) to defeat the [[French Battleship Summer Princess]]
# Unlock the path to the [[European Water Princess]] (Easy+)
# Unlock the alternate path to the [[European Water Princess]]
# Chipping away at the  [[European Water Princess]]
# Triggering the Debuff for the [[European Water Princess]]
# Defeating the [[European Water Princess]]

The following guide will look at each phase on Hard mode and go downward through easier difficulties as the strategies can vary on lower difficulty levels.

''' Step 1: Use the Carrier Task Force (<span style="color:Blue">Force H</span> Hard Mode) to defeat the [[Battleship Summer Princess]]

'''Recommended Fleet: 4 CV(L)(B), 2 (F)BB(V) + 1 CL, 1-2 CA, 3 DD 0-1 CLT (0(Casual)/2(Easy)/4(Normal)/6(Hard) European Ships needed for best pathing)'''

'''Path: C-A-D-E-J or C-A-D-F-I-J ''' (with European Ship requirement)
'''Path: C-A-B-D-E-J or C-A-B-D-F-I-J ''' (without meeting European Ship requirement [May be recommend for planning out the  <span style="color:Purple">'''Rheinübung Fleet'''</span> on Hard Mode)

'''LBAS Recommendation:'''

* '''LBAS 1: 0-2 Interceptor + 2-4 LBAS Bombers (Depending on difficulty & Equipment)'''
* '''LBAS 2: 0-1 Interceptor + 3-4 LBAS Bombers (Depending on difficulty & Equipment)'''
* '''LBAS 3: 4 LBAS Bombers'''
* '''LBAS 3 Alternative: 3-4 Interceptor + 0-1 Saiun (If using for base defense)'''
** Distance of 4 Needed

The first part of the operation is somewhat simple as your fleet will go through a Submarine fleet, followed by a Surface Fleet. Following this you'll have to choose a path, but regardless you will need fight the same Carrier Fleet. While it isn't necessary to go through both paths, it's recommended to at least try it once as beating Node I will contribute to a later part of the mission requirements. 

If you can successfully pass these nodes without taking too much damage you'll face the [[Battleship Summer Princess]] whose fleet consists of a combined fleet and may include a [[Heavy Cruiser Summer Princess]]. Depending on the difficulty, this fleet may or may not have air power. 

Overall using a strong LBAS and a strong fleet along with boss support should make short work of the enemy fleets and the boss making the battle easy to complete. 

In addition, this area is a good place for farm for German ships and [[Gotland]].

'''Step 2: Use The Surface Task Force ( <span style="color:Purple">'''Rheinübung Fleet'''</span> Hard Mode) to defeat the [[French Battleship Summer Princess]]'''

'''Recommended Fleet varies depending on difficulty'''

* '''Casual/Easy: 4(F)BB(V), 0-1 CA, 0-1 AV, 0-1 CV, 0-2 CVL, 0-1SS(V) + 1CL, 2-4 DD, 1-2 CA, 0-1 AV, 0-1 CLT (1/2 European ships required + more if you choose to bring CVLs and/or CLT) '''  
* '''Normal: 3(F)BB(V), 1-2 CA(V), 0-1 AV, 0-1 CV, 0-2 CVL, 0-1SS(V) + 1CL, 2-4 DD, 1-2 CA, 0-1 AV, 0-1 CLT (4 European ships required + more if you choose to bring CVLs and/or CLT) '''  
* '''Hard: 2(F)BB(V), 1-2 CA, 0-1 AV, 0-1 CV, 0-2 CVL, 0-1SS(V) + 1CL, 2-4 DD, 1-2 CA, 0-1 AV, 0-1 CLT (5 European ships required + more if you choose to bring CVLs and/or CLT) '''


'''Path: U-V-T-R-Q-P-L-O-W''' (with European Ship requirement + German and French Ships)

'''LBAS Recommendation'''

* '''LBAS 1-2 (Node W): 1 Interceptor/Fighter + 3 LBAS Bombers or Torpedo Bombers''' 
* '''LBAS 3 (Node W): 4 LBAS Bombers or Torpedo Bombers'''
* '''LBAS 3 (Node T): 0-3 Toukai + ASW Bomber or 4 ASW Bomber'''

On this path your surface task force fleet will have to travel through some sub fleet consisting of the [[New Submarine Princess]] which can be a possible issue unless you confront them in a line abreast formation or use a LBAS consisting of ASW plane to help take out subs. Following this, you will encounter a carrier fleet. Depending on the difficulty, this will require you to have relatively high fighter power to either maintain or overcome the air power. A high plane capacity carrier like [[Intrepid]] or similar are preferred or bringing 2 CVL in your fleet. Finally, you'll encounter a Surface fleet consisting of battleships, torpedo cruisers, light cruisers, and destroyers which should be easily managed under normal Surface Task Force conditions. 

If you choose to bring a submarine in your fleet be aware tat nodes P and L will have lots of small ships that may be ASW capable and could present a possible issue but having a submarine at the boss node will help give you a big advantage compared to other ships.

Once reaching the boss fleet, you will encounter the [[French Summmer Battleship Princess]] accompanied by a [[Summer Harbor Princess]], possibly an [[Airfield Princess]] (doesn't appear outside final kill on lower difficulties), some [[Artillery Imp]]s, [[PT Imp Group]]s, Destroyers and a light cruiser. 

Depending on the difficulty you play and the approach you do, the amount of work required to defeating her will vary. Below are some compositions that can be considered:

'''Hard:''' 

* [[Bismarck]] [[Richelieu]], 2 CA, 1 CV, 1 SS + 1CL, 1 AV ([[Commandant Teste]]), 2 CA (including [[Prinz Eugen]],  2 DD ([[Tashkent]] preferred)
* [[Bismarck]], [[Richelieu]], 2 CA, 2CVL, + 1CL, 1 AV([[Commandant Teste]]), 2 CA (including [[Prinz Eugen]],  2 DD ([[Tashkent]] preferred)

In this difficulty, you will need everything you can possibly throw at the boss to ensure the greatest chances of success in battle. Your equipment will need to be well modified and prepared so that your ships can attack all enemy units effectively and maximize the damage you can deliver upon them. Bringing a Sub can be risky since the earlier battles present great dangers that can potentially risk the sub sinking in battle, so if you choose this path, bring in route support to minimize your sub's risk of sinking. Boss support is also highly recommended as they will be needed to help eliminate or take out certain enemy units in the battle along with your LBAS. 

Since the boss is located close to your air base, you can use interceptors or strong AA type planes in 1 slot of both your first and 2nd air base to help reduce the air power. If you are utilizing the sub strategy, do consider that if you bring too much anti-air and shoot down all of [[French Summmer Battleship Princess]]'s planes will result in her targeting your fleet rather than your sub.

Carefully consider the placement of AA guns/skilled lookouts for your ships. In the event PT Imps survive the opening attacks they can easily take away shots that could target the big 3 targets. You want to try to reduce the fleet down to just the 3 major targets and do as much damage as you can to the princesses before the Day Battle turn ends. 

If all goes well, your friend fleet may be able to pick off at least one installation and leave the other for your Anti-installation ships in the escort fleet to finish off in night battle. 

Outside of this, the [[French Summmer Battleship Princess]] has armor that exceeds cap levels (312 armor) making it very difficulty to strike through her. She is however most weak to attacks coming from European ships (about 1.2x modifier), so use torpedo cut in set up for your DDs like [[Tashkent]] and CAs like [[Prinz Eugen]] to hope you score a low armor roll and/or crit which can successfully end the battle.

'''Medium:'''

* [[Bismarck]] [[Richelieu]] + 1 BB, 1 CA, 1 CV, 1 SS + 1CL, 0-1 AV([[Commandant Teste]]), 1-2 CA ([[Prinz Eugen]] preferred), 0-1 CLT  2-3 DD (Include [[Tashkent]] and/or other Euro DD)
* [[Bismarck]] [[Richelieu]] + 1 BB, 1 CA, 2 CVL + 1CL, 0-1 AV([[Commandant Teste]]), 1-2 CA ([[Prinz Eugen]] preferred), 0-1 CLT  2-3 DD (Include [[Tashkent]] and/or other Euro DD)

Most of the above mentioned strategies should remain the same, however without the tag restrictions that occur on hard mode. This makes it possible to bring more Heavy hitting ships along with extra European ships without restriction.

Enemy composition should also be weaker and easier to deal with, especially if you have enough European ships in tow with you. Allowing for your fleet to bring more damage buffer ships and be able to fight efficiently without restriction. 

The [[French Summmer Battleship Princess]] is still heavily armored but does have less armor than on hard mode. 

''' Easy/ Casual'''

* 4BB, 1 CV, 1SS(V) + 1CL, 2-3 DD, 2 CA, 1 CLT 
* 4BB, 2CVL + 1CL, 2-3 DD, 2 CA, 1 CLT 

Same case, but now with freedom to use a full set of BBs in the main fleet. As mentioned before, European ships are still very helpful here because of the damage multiplier. The [[French Summmer Battleship Princess]]'s armor should be low enough the a European ship cut in and / or crit from any ship should be more than enough to defeat her if her HP is low.

Once completed, the new boss bar will appear which will then begin the final phase of the battle. 

'''Step 3: Unlock the path to the European Water Princess (Easy+)'''

'''Note: If you're playing on Casual, the path to the boss will be already open, so you can disregard this step.

'''Recommended Fleet: 4 CV(L)(B), 2 (F)BB(V) + 1 CL, 1-2 CA, 3 DD, 0-1 CLT'''

LBAS: Not Necessary, consider Air Defense or Evacuate for this phase

'''Path: C-A-D-F-H or C-A-D-F-I (with European Ship requirement)'''

In this step you'll use your carrier task for to go to Node H and I and defeat some basic enemy fleets. Node H consists of Battleships while I has carriers. Use your fleet to successfully defeat the enemy in each node and score an S rank. Once the condition is met, the new path should be unlocked to the boss.

'''Step 4: Unlock the alternate path to the [[European Water Princess]]'''

2-4(F)BB(V), 0-1 CA, 0-1 CL, 0-1 CV, 0-2 CVL, + 1CL, 2-5 DD 0-2 DE (ASW Focused)

'''Path: U-V-T-R-Q-P-L-O-W''' (with European Ship requirement + German and French Ships) (only consider additional nodes if Land Base Air Raid has not triggered past T consider discontinuing sortie before W)

* '''LBAS 1-2 (Node W): 4 Interceptor/Fighter or 3 Interceptor/ Fighter + Saiun (may not need both LBAS depending on equipment + difficulty)
* '''LBAS 1-2 (Node K): 4 Interceptor/Fighter or 3 Interceptor/ Fighter + Saiun (may not need both LBAS depending on equipment + difficulty)
* '''LBAS 3 (Node T): 0-3 Toukai + 1 ASW Bomber or 4 ASW Bomber'''

In this operation you will need to complete the following objectives:

* Defeat the [[New Submarine Princess]] fleet at Node T 
* Successfully gain Air Superiority at an LBAS Air Raid (Twice on Medium +, Once on Casual - Easy)
* Score AS as Node K ( Twice on Hard, Once on Medium)

Bring a Fleet with ASW capable ships and use your fleet along with an ASW LBAS or ASW support fleet to help wipe out the subs at Node T. LBAS air raids should trigger as early as Node T making it possible to consider pulling back after you complete Node T. 

Once you completed this step, consider organizing your fleet with two CVL or other ships that can carry Carrier based equipment and travel through node M which will consist of a large group of battleships. Then you will reach an air attack node where you must gain air superiority on. The best way to do this is to send both LBAS that you used for the LBAS Air Raid to Node K as they will be more than sufficient for helping you fleet achieve Air superiority. 

Repeat until conditions are met and an alternate path will be open for your surface fleet to travel to the boss.

'''Step 5: Chipping away at the  [[European Water Princess]]'''

* ''' 2(F)BB(V),2 CA, 2 CVL, + 1CL, 3 DD, 1-2 CA, 0-1 CLT (European ships required to meet the difficulty requirements) 

'''Path: U-V-T-R-Q-M-X-Z3-Z2''' (with European Ship requirement)'''

* '''LBAS 1 (Node Z2): 0-2 Fighter + 1-4 LBAS Bombers''' (more fighters needed depending on difficulty + Equipment)
* '''LBAS 2 (Node Z2): 0-1 Fighter + 2-4 LBAS Bombers''' (more fighters needed depending on difficulty + Equipment)
* '''LBAS 3 (Node Z2): 4 LBAS Bombers''' (more fighters needed depending on difficulty + Equipment)
* '''LBAS 3 (Node T): 0-3 Toukai + 1 ASW Bomber or 4 ASW Bombers'''
** '''(Distance of 7 Required)'''

This path is the shortest path the STF can take to the boss and should arrive with a decent supply of fuel and ammo. Your fleet along with LBAS should be able to damage most enemy units with ease. On higher difficulties, you will have to deal with additional princesses. If necessary, bring boss support to do as much damage as you can to the [[European Water Princess]]. 

European ships and various European equipment can provide additional modifiers against the boss. Consider this when building your fleet to maximize damage. 

'''Step 6: Triggering the Debuff for the [[European Water Princess]] (Recommended for Normal +)'''

'''STF - 2(F)BB(V),2 CA, 2 CVL, + 1CL, 3 DD, 1-2 CA, 0-1 CLT (European ships required to meet the difficult requirements)'''

'''Path: U-V-T-R-Q-M-X-Z3-Z2''' (with European Ship requirement)'''

'''CTF - 4 CV(B), 2 (F)BB(V) + 1 CL, 0-2 CA, 3-5 DD 0-1 CLT (European ships required to meet the difficult requirements)'''

'''Path: C-A-D-F-H-X-Y-Z2 or C-A-D-F-H-X-Z3-Z2 (with European Ship requirement)'''

* '''LBAS 1 (Node Z2): 0-3 Fighter + 1-4 LBAS Bombers''' (more fighters needed depending on difficulty + Equipment)
* '''LBAS 2 (Node Z2): 0-2 Fighter + 2-4 LBAS Bombers''' (more fighters needed depending on difficulty + Equipment)
* '''LBAS 3 (Node Z2): 0-1 Fighter + 3-4 LBAS Bombers''' (more fighters needed depending on difficulty + Equipment)

In the final battle against the [[European Water Princess]]  players on higher difficulties will need to successfully debuff the boss so she can be killed. You will need to complete the following conditions:

* Score an A rank with the STF
* Score an A rank with the CTF

Bringing the appropriate fleet will along with a strong Boss support and LBAS should allow you to gain an A rank on lower difficulty, but you may need to have stronger ships like CLT and Topedo Cut in ships for higher difficulties especially on hard where you will face a main fleet of multiple princesses. 

If you successfully score an A rank with both fleets, when returning to base, you should hear a confirmation tone indicating you completed the debuff.

Players on Easy and Casual can optionally consider this step as the [[European Water Princess]] is weak enough that she should be able to be killed without the help of the debuff.

'''Step 7: Triggering the Debuff for the [[European Water Princess]]'''

'''STF - 2(F)BB(V),2 CA, 2 CVL, + 1CL, 3 DD, 1-2 CA, 0-1 CLT (European ships required to meet the difficult requirements, , Recommended for Casual and Easy)'''

'''Path: U-V-T-R-Q-M-X-Z3-Z2''' (with European Ship requirement)'''

'''CTF - 4 CV(B), 2 (F)BB(V) + 1 CL, 0-2 CA, 3-5 DD 0-1 CLT (European ships required to meet the difficult requirements, recommended for Medium and Hard or as an alternative if STF doesn't work)'''

'''Path: C-A-D-F-H-X-Y-Z2 or C-A-D-F-H-X-Z3-Z2 (with European Ship requirement)'''

The final step can be use the very same process that was used in Part 6 if you chose to debuff. As a CTF will be needed to deliver the final blow if you choose to play on Medium and Hard difficulty.

With the debuff in place the boss fleet will be severely weakened and the following damage modifiers will occur:

* All ships get a 1.5x modifier
* European Ships get an additional 1.2x modifier
* 1.3x modifier if Seaplane Bomber or Seaplane Fighter is equipped
* 1.2x modifier if Type 3 is equipped
* 1.2 - 1.25x modifier if Dive Bombers is equipped
* [[Ark Royal]] Kai gets a modifier based on the swordfish TB she is equipped.
** 1.35x - 1.45x if one Swordfish
** 1.7x if two Swordfish

Take an en route support and Boss support to help successfully reach the boss. Boss fleet should fall easily and with a well place torpedo cut in, you should be able to successfully win the battle.
