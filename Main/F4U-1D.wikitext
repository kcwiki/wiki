==Introduction==
高性能艦上戦闘機として開発が進められたF4U、航空母艦での運用が難しいと思われた初期型は陸上から運用されました。<br>
その改良戦闘爆撃機型である本機及び同後期シリーズは、機動部隊で運用され、マルチロールな活躍ぶりを発揮、戦闘爆撃機として長い間現役を務めます。

''The F4U was originally developed as a highly efficient carrier-based fighter aircraft, but using its early models on aircraft carriers was considered too difficult, so they were operated from land bases.''<br>
''This plane, which is an improved fighter bomber model, as well as later models belonging to this series were used in task forces and displayed the capability of fulfilling multiple roles, so they enjoyed a long time in service as fighter bomber.''
