==Introduction==
大きな航続距離を持つ、四発の大型爆撃機です。当時の陸上攻撃機としてはかなり大規模な機体で、あのB-29に迫るかなりの大型機です。米国の大型旅客機を参考に開発されましたが、運動性が悪く、発動機や機体各部も不具合続きで信頼性と実用性に欠け、不採用となりました。

This is a long-range, four-engine large bomber. It was big for a land-based bomber in those days, roughly equal to the B-29 in size. It was developed based on the large passenger aircraft from the US. It was rejected due to poor manoeuvrability and flaws in the engine and airframe which caused problems with its reliability and utility.
