N/A

===Overview===

===Analysis===
Priority: '''High'''
: She is a below average CV in her kai form. Her only saving grace is that she is cheap to run. Her 18 slots are small and liable to be emptied by heavy enemy anti-air. This can compromise her ability to take advantage of plane proficiency bonuses and artillery spot. 
: Her Kai Ni has a low remodel level and is cheap. When combined with her above good firepower, it makes her a decent carrier. She is still let down by her slot distribution because her top slot is still 18. She does get a buff to her large slot which gives her a harder hitting airstrike. It is important that she gets to Kai Ni quickly because she gives you access to the Suisei Egusa.

====Recommended Roles====
* Combat - Kai Ni
* Air Support
* Shelling Support - Kai Ni

====Not Recommended Roles====
* Combat - Kai
* Support Expedition - Kai
* Airstrike Support

===Important Info===
* Required for quests A19, A36, A39, B25, and B26
* She is a source for Type 99 Egusa <Souryuu>
* She is a source for Type 97 Tomonaga <Hiryuu>
