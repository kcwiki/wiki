=Akashi=
==Gameplay Notes==
===Special Mechanics===
* She has the ability to repair other ships in the fleet.
** She must be the flagship.
*** She does not have to be in fleet 1
** Akashi or the ships being repaired  must not be more than <span style="color:gold;">'''lightly damaged (小破)'''</span>. 
** Akashi or the ships being repaired must not be in the docks.
** The ability works as follows:
*** Once '''20 minutes''' have elapsed, returning to the home screen after that time will reset the timer and repair all eligible ships.
**** Changing out ships or shifting them around will '''reset the 20 minute timer''' without repairing.
**** If the amount of HP recovery would be less than 1 after 20 minutes, it will be rounded up. This means ships that take more than 20 minutes to recover 1hp can be repaired faster by Akashi if you keep checking in every 20 minutes.
**** Amount of HP recovered is calculated individually for each target.
*** By default, she can only repair herself and the ship in the 2nd slot. Every [[Ship Repair Facility]] equipped will increase the amount of repairable ships by 1.
*** Please see [[Docking]] for more details about repair time and cost.
**** Unlike the listed repair time formula, Akashi's repair just has the seconds rounded up instead of having 30 seconds added.
*** The repair cost is automatically deducted based on how much HP has been repaired on update.
*** Repair works even if she isn't in the 1st fleet.
*** If you do not have sufficient resources, the repair will not work.
* She has the ability to upgrade equipment. Please see [[Akashi's Improvement Arsenal]] for more details.

===Overview===
Her stats are irrelevant to her main role.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Very High'''

: She is the most important girl in your fleet because of her ability to upgrade equipment. It is the only way to access most event and ranking only equipment. Equipment upgrades are important to boost the effectiveness of your other girls. Her repair ability is a nice bonus that allows you to get more girls repaired while away for an extended period of time. It is imperative that you get her to Kai as soon as possible for the boost in success rates.

===Important Info===
* Required for quest A45.
* Required for all equipment upgrade quests.

===Analysis===
Priority:'''Low'''

: Her main role is to provide an experience boost in PvP. When paired with her sister [[Kashima]], they can give a significant boost. Her low combat and defensive stats makes her unsuited for surface combat. She does have an edge when it comes to ASW because she possesses 4 slots which allows her to get maximum synergy bonuses. However, her low base ASW becomes an issue when trying to achieve OASW. She well require a lot of levels to be effective.

===Analysis===

: She has a limited role in providing air support where carriers or other aviation ships cannot be used. Although she can perform ASW, she is subpar in this role because she cannot take advantage of synergy bonuses or achieve OASW.

===Overview===
Her stats are irrelevant to her main role.

===Analysis===
Priority:'''Medium'''

: Her main role is to carry Maritime Resupplies to mitigate ammo penalties in long maps. Do note that the resupplies are consumed upon activation. When equipped with torpedo bombers, she becomes a very effective combatant because she uses the carrier shelling formula and gains plane proficiency bonus. Her drawback is that she is at risk of getting her slots emptied when encountering heavy anti-air.

===Overview===
* Good firepower and torpedo.
* Decent HP and armour.
* Good plane count.
* Good slot distribution.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Medium'''

: She has a good torpedo stat that allows her to take out lighter ships with her opening torpedo. She also has respectable firepower for a seaplane tender that makes her a decent surface combatant. Her slots are also large enough that she can use seaplane bombers to deal with light targets. Being able to carry seaplane fighters means she can provide air supports in maps where carriers are restricted. However, she is slow which means she will be affected by speed restrictions.

Priority:'''High'''

* Kai
: She has a good torpedo stat that allows her to take out lighter ships with her opening torpedo. She also has good firepower for a seaplane tender that makes her a decent surface combatant. While she has a large slot, her slot distribution isn't ideal to utilise seaplane bombers because she needs to place one in a small slot to take advantage of proficiency bonuses. In additiion, her ability to equip [[WG42]] and the [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank]] makes her a powerful anti installation ship.

* A
: She gains a significant upgrade to her torpedo and firepower that makes her an even better combat ship. Her biggest upgrade is gaining a 4th slot. This means she is the only ship capable of running an artillery spotting setup with opening torpedoes. The 4th slot also increases her anti-installation ability significantly.

* Unlike other seaplane tenders, she can equip small sonars at Kai.

===Overview===
* Low firepower.

===Analysis===
Priority: **High**

: Her main role is to allow slow fleets in 6-4 to take the shorter route. She can provide air support with seaplane fighters but her low defensive stats and slow speed means you should avoid using her where possible. The reason she is a high priority is the Type 2 Flying Boat she provides. It is a key piece of equipment for extending the range of your LBAS.

===Analysis===
Priority: '''Medium'''

: Her firepower and ability to artillery spot is enough to make her a decent daytime combatant. But she falls off in effectiveness at night because she lacks a torpedo stat. Her 4 slots and high plane count allows her to take full advantage of plane proficiency bonuses for airstrikes with seaplane bombers. Being able to equip [[WG42]] and the [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank]] also makes her a powerful anti-installation ship.
