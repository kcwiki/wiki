==Introduction==
新開発の長8cm高角砲の改良型です。<br>
秋月型に装備された長10cm高角砲の小型軽量化を図った対空用副砲バージョンです。微妙な出来という評価もありますが、新型艦艇装備の防空兵装として期待されていました。本装備は小型軽量に特徴のある超8cm砲を熟成した改良型と単装機銃集中配備の組み合わせによる対空兵装パッケージです。<br><br>

The improved version of the newly developed long 8cm high angle gun.<br><br>

It is a miniaturized and lightened anti-air secondary gun version of the Akizuki class's long 10cm high angle gun. While it is evaluated to be of little improvement, it was anticipated by the warships built later into the war. This piece of anti-air equipment is the combination package of an improved model of the aging lightweight, miniature super 8cm gun with a concentration of single-barreled machine guns.
