The Second Part of the event will be released during the '''July 10th, 2020''' and will have your fleet going to the South where they will be participating in a the major Battle of the South Pacific; it has been noted that Carriers will play an important role here.

==Friend Fleet==
===Fleet Formations===
Friend Fleets will now come with a new function which will allow players to choose if they wish to bring in a Friend Fleet to aid them in battle or not. They can also choose to also decide if they want a normal Friend Fleet come aid them in battle or if they wish to use a powerful Friend Fleet that will require the cost of '''6 Instant Constructions''' [[File:Instant_construction-0.jpg]] to allow you call in a more powerful Friend Fleet to aid you into battle. 

If you choose to opt in for the powerful Friend fleet, the '''Instant Constructions''' [[File:Instant_construction-0.jpg]] will not be consumed unless a powerful Friend Fleet appears.

==Mechanics==
===Participation requirements===
*Must have a 75% sortie win ratio.
*Must have 5 empty ship slots for new ships.
*Must have 20 free equipment slots.

===Special Mechanics===
#The difficulty system first used in [[Spring 2015 Event]] returns: you can choose between Operation A ({{lang|ja|甲}}, Hard), Operation B ({{lang|ja|乙}}, Medium), Operation C ({{lang|ja|丙}}, Easy) or Operation D ({{lang|ja|丁}}, Very Easy) .
#*Choosing A or B requires certain HQ Level (HQ Lv 35 for B / 80 for A in Spring 2015 Event).
#*'''An important note''' to all Admirals intending to clear the event on Hard difficulty - further (new) conditions now apply:'''
#**When switching difficulty from ''any other difficulty'' to Hard, the map's debuff mechanism (where applicable) will be reset.
#***Switching between any other difficulties will not reset the debuff mechanism.
#The debuff system from [[Summer 2015 Event]]'s final map, where certain nodes had to be attacked and other conditions fulfilled to reduce boss armor, will return.
<!---# It is possible that a fleet with '''seven''' ships ('''[[Striking Force Fleet]]''') will be allowed to sortie to certain event maps that permit '''single fleet operations'''.
#*The Striking Force '''cannot''' be sortied during exercises or sent on expeditions while it contains seven ships.
#*The Striking Force can only be created and used in the '''third''' fleet in the menu (out of a total of four fleets).
#*A Striking Force with a flagship that carries a new piece of equipment, the '''[[Striking Force Fleet Command Facility]]''', will be able to make use of the new '''Single Ship Evacuation''' mechanic.
#**The new Striking Force Fleet Command Facility will become obtainable and useable via the old [[Fleet Command Facility]] and the '''Action Report'''.
#***Note that the [[Quests#F64|relevant quest]] will consume the [[Fleet Command Facility]] in order to convert it into the new [[Striking Force Fleet Command Facility]].
#**Supplementary information regarding the new [[Striking Force Fleet Command Facility]] and the Single Ship Evacuation it allows when carried by the striking force's flagship:
#***The evacuation does not require an escort destroyer.
#***The evacuation consumes the ship's entire fuel & ammo reserves. 
#***Only one ship can be evacuated per battle.
#***'''The damage the ship suffered may become worse during the evacuation, but she will never sink.'''--->
# Returning this event, the '''Vanguard Formation''' can be used .
#*This formation will organize the fleet such that the 3rd-6th/7th ships protect the Flagship and 2nd Ship of the Fleet.
#**In addition, the formation allows for ships to become more evasive in combat situations, especially with well-trained Destroyer.
#** This formation is also available '''only during the duration of the event.'''
#**The formation will be usable by [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/930623111862435841 both] normal fleets as well as the Striking Force Fleet.
#'''NPC Friend Fleets''' have been introduced into the game.
#* Friend Fleets act as another unit that appears in particular battles to help aid your fleet when attacking the enemy at the start of night battle.
#** NPC Friend Fleets are selected from a randomized preset list of ship.
#** Depending on who you have in your fleet can also influence who will be arrive to aid you in battle.
#'''Enemy Radar Ambush Nodes''' have been introduced into the game.
#* Entering this node will result in your fleet facing off against an enemy fleet that will ambush and attack your fleet 
#** Your Fleet will not be able to fight against the enemy Fleet.
#** By meeting certain conditions, you can evade these nodes.
#[[Repairs#Emergency_Anchorage_Repair|'''Emergency Anchorage Maintenance/Repairs''']] 【緊急泊地修理】
#*Both [[Akashi|Akashi Kai]] and [[Akitsushima|Akitsushima Kai]] will be capable of conducting emergency repairs; however, Akitsushima has more limited capabilities compared to Akashi.
#*See under [[Repairs#Emergency_Anchorage_Repairs|Emergency Anchorage Repairs]] for details.
#[[Land-Based_Air_Squadron#High_Altitude_Air_Raid|'''High-Altitude Abyssal Bombers''']] that are resistant to all types of interceptors other than the new land-based jet interceptors may also return this event.
