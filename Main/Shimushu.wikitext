===Analysis===
Priority: '''Medium'''

:Destroyer escorts, also known as ''kaiboukan'', are cheap, mass-produced vessels focused on ASW, and that's what they should be used for.
:With proper gear, they can perform OASW attacks from level 1 and consume very little fuel and ammo, giving an excellent bang for your bucks when it comes to dealing with subs.
:However, they are a poor fit for surface combat, so make sure not to expose them to enemy surface ships too much.

:The differences in combat stats that actually matter between DEs are minimal, so feel free to use the ones you prefer.
:They're also very cheap and easy to sparkle, and can therefore be used in expeditions that do not require a [[Drum Canister]] (as they cannot equip those).
:Furthermore, they can be used for an unique kind of [[Modernization]] that can increase HP, ASW and Luck. Refer to the corresponding page for details on that.


====Recommended Roles====
* ASW
* Modernization
