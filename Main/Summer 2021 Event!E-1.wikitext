The event guides are to be constructed through the respective [[Sandbox/Summer 2021 E-1|Event map page guide]] and reviewed by editor staff / collaboration committee before being approved here.

==Ship Bonuses (Tentative)==

{{:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/E-1/Historical_Ships}}

=Overview=
* There are quests related to this event where clearing them will allow access to the Strike Force Fleet (7 Ship Fleet)
** The prerequisite for the quest is one of the event preparation quests that was released in the [[Game Updates/2021/August 4th|August 4th update]] prior to the event.
* For players who wish to clear E1 on Hard mode, the quests can be cleared on '''Casual''' first before switching to Hard mode and clearing the map. 
** Be aware that switching to a higher difficulty will reset all progress on the map. So, unless you really need to conserve resources and are confident enough, you can opt to do all the quests while clearing on Hard.
{{color|red|※ Once the 2nd starting point has been unlocked, having '''"3+ historical European ships"''' or '''"2+ DDs & 1- DE & (2+ CL / Strike Force)"''' should guarantee Starting Point {{MapRoute|2|}} and giving {{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag2}}{{ToolTip|[Grey Tag]|'''Mediterranean Fleet'''}} to the fleet.}}
* Failure to meet the above requirements will automatically force the fleet to Starting Point {{MapRoute|1|}} and be labeled with {{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag1}}{{ToolTip|[Yellow Tag]|'''1st Special Squadron'''}}. Please review the fleet setup before launching them on sortie.
* Historical European Ships include all ships from the European nations with the exception of Russian ships (excluding '''[[Verniy]]''' who is allowed).
* In Addition to this, ships that are affiliated with ties to service with the European nations are acceptable:
** '''ABDA Forces: [[Houston]], [[Perth]], [[De Ruyter]]
** '''Atlantic Fleet: [[Washington]]
* Players who have the appropriate Anti-installation gear and a decent amount of European planes that are part of the bonus list, can possibly clear E1 without using European ships.

=Event Quest Guide=
* Both quests are available on '''all''' difficulties and can be done at any point on E1. {{color|red|The completion of the first quest requires the second phase of the map to be unlocked.}}

Strategic Notes:
* After completing Phase 2, {{MapRoute|P|red}} is locked to the third composition
* Node P is a fight against 3 Installation Princesses/Demons, all of which have various weaknesses against different anti-installation equipment.
* Equip with [[Combat/Anti-Installation#Equipment_Setups|nuke setups]]; however, please note the specific weaknesses listed below.
** Anchorage Water Demon
*** Vulnerable to most anti-installation equipment but is also the most resilient.
*** Avoid using DBs that can target installations as carriers should be focusing this target
*** One effective method to take her down is by using carriers with 2DB + 1TB setups and using one European plane from Group A and one from Group B, if available.
** Supply Depot Princess
*** [[Combat/Anti-Installation#Equipment_Setups|Nuke setups]] are the most effective way to take her down.
*** May require several hits to take down due to high HP.
** Airfield Princess
*** Type 3 Shells are the most effective means of defeating her.

=='''Phase 3: Destroy Enemy Ne Kai's Combined Fleet'''==
{{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag2}}{{ToolTip|[Grey Tag]|'''Mediterranean Fleet'''}} Strike Force Fleet: '''0-2 (F)BB(V), 1-2 CA(V), 0-1 AV, 0-2 CL, 3-4 DD'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|2||I|red|N|blue|R|blue|T|purple|V|red}}
* If slow, max of 1 (F)BB(V)
LBAS
* Range = 6
* Pre-LD: No enemy air present (Hard)
* LD: AD/AP/AS = 32/63/140 (Hard)
Strategic Notes:
* Node {{MapRoute|T|purple}} is a Night battle. So it's highly recommended to make use of the Vanguard Formation to pass through the node.
* The boss node {{MapRoute|V|red}} is an abyssal combined fleet.
* Be aware a CVL will appear in the comp on LD on harder difficulties.

==Bonus: Cyprus Ammo Farming==
It is possible to collect ammo on E1 with a simple fleet comp, facing only a single battle before reaching the resource node. This can be used to collect ammo as high as '''150 ammo per run'''.

Method #1: {{Shiplock|Summer2021EventTag1}}{{ToolTip|[Yellow Tag]|'''1st Special Squadron'''}} Single Fleet: '''AO, 3-5 DD/DE'''
* Route: {{MapRoute|1||A|blue|B|blue|C|red|C2|blue}}
LBAS: N/A
* Either set LBAS on standby/rest or send them to the battle node before {{MapRoute|C2|blue}}
* Use Vanguard to survive Node {{MapRoute|C|red}}.
Increase resource gains by equipping the following:
* +10 Ammo per [[Drum Canister]]
* +15 Ammo per [[Daihatsu]], [[Daihatsu Landing Craft (Type 89 Medium Tank & Landing Force)|89 Tank Variants]] and [[Type 2 Ka-Mi Tank]]
