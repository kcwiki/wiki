==Introduction==
<center>'''Important Notice''': <br> ''The E-5 boss's armor will be reduced and will not regenerate from December 7th onward for admirals on the Truk Anchorage server. <br>For other servers, during the last hours of December 8th the E-5 boss's armor will not regenerate.''</center>


The Fall 2015 event "Charge! Maritime Transport Operation" will start November 18th, 2015. The event will be medium-scaled and will feature combined fleets. The Kancolle dev team has hinted the event will be taking place in a "circular island" in the Southern Seas. Within that location, there will be several battles and "transportation operations". The event map will therefore likely be a series of battles that took place at [[wikipedia:Kolombangara|Kolombangara]]. 

If this is true, expect the majority of the events battles to consist of smaller fleets performing "Tokyo Express" runs. The dev team have hinted that well-trained destroyers and light cruisers will be key to clearing the event. Since most of the battles at Kolombongara were small engagements, sorties will likely be inspired by  the [[Wikipedia:Battle of Kula Gulf|Battle of Kula Gulf]], [[Wikipedia:Battle of Kolombangara|The Battle of Kolombangara]], and the [[Wikipedia:Battle of Vella Gulf|Battle of Vella Gulf]]. Some maps may feature only night battles. 

However, there will still be some engagements involving heavier fleets. These will be combined fleet operations.

The event is planned to end on December 8th,2015.

*A total of 4 ship girls are confirmed:
*Training cruiser [[Kashima]] is the [[#E-3|E-3]] clearance reward.
**The Comtiq article in December's magazine mentioned it would be the second ship of the [[:Category:Katori Class|Katori Class]] training cruisers.
*[[Arashi]] was hinted at in an article from Comtique Magazine's September issue. It made mention of a destroyer that worked alongside [[Kawakaze|Kawakaze]] and engaged in a furious night battle. The Battle of Vella Gulf ties this connection together as both of them sunk during middle of the night.
**November's issue hints that a destroyer that was sunk in the area the event will take place will appear.
*[[Hagikaze]] also has been introduced to the game.
*German Aircraft Carrier [[Graf Zeppelin]] was hinted at through Comptiq's December issue, where they revealed that a "foreign capital ship" will be appearing.
*[[Mizuho]] will be a drop. 
*[[Akizuki]] and [[Prinz Eugen]] will be among the drops in this event, making this their first appearance since the [[Fall 2014 Event|Autumn 2014 Event]].

===New Enemy Vessels===
*There are four new enemy vessels:
**[[PT Imp Group]]
**[[Submarine Princess]]
**[[Light Cruiser Princess]]
**[[Destroyer Water Demon]]

===New Equipment===
*[[Bf109 T Kai]]
*[[Fw190 T Kai]]
*[[10.5cm Twin Gun Mount]]
**All three of these are stock equipment from [[Graf Zeppelin]].

==Mechanics==
===Participation requirements===
*Must have a 75% sortie win ratio.
*Must have 5 empty ship slots for new ships.
*Must have 20 free equipment slots.

===Special Mechanics===
# The difficulty system first used in [[Spring 2015 Event]] returns: you can choose between Operation A ({{lang|ja|甲}}, Hard), Operation B ({{lang|ja|乙}}, Medium) or Operation C ({{lang|ja|丙}}, Easy).
#* Choosing A or B requires certain HQ Level (HQ Lv 35 for B / 80 for A in Spring 2015 Event).
# The armor-reducing system of the [[Summer 2015 Event]]'s final map, where certain nodes had to be killed to reduce boss armor, is likely to return, but in a simplified version.
# According to this [https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/status/663884408374452224 tweet], Operation A ({{lang|ja|甲}}, Hard) and Operation B ({{lang|ja|乙}}, Medium) will require you to have mutiple fleets ready, which suggests fleet locking.
# The initial maps will focus on transport operations (Lighter ships, such as CLs and DDs likely), while the later maps will focus on heavy ships (CVs and BBs).

**Requires going through node G to reduce the boss gauge (but the only path to boss always goes through G)
**You do not need to sink the flagship to deplete the gauge, just get A rank or better
**The Gauge decreases at the rate of 40 per run, +3.5 per [[Drum Canister]] equipped, +5.5 per [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft]] equipped. The decrease is increased by 44% if you score an S-rank victory instead of just an A-rank victory.

|tips = *Because you are not allowed any carriers for this map, only [[Akitsu Maru]], AVs, CAVs, and BBVs can be used for air superiority purposes. This is critical for the boss node since on all difficulties there are 3 enemies that can perform artillery spotting attacks. You would need about 50 to 60 air power at the boss node for Air Parity on hard mode.
**Whether you have [[Akitsu Maru]] for this map changes how you could approach this map. If you don't have her, it is difficult (if not outright impossible) to make even Air Parity on higher difficulties without making BBV/CAV Zuiun mules (and the former forces you to go through the night battle node filled with [[PT Imp Group]]s).
*Having a good support expedition is critical to have a good chance of successfully reducing the gauge. Having both enroute and boss support is critical to ensure your ships make it through to the boss (relatively) intact.
*If you have the [[Fleet Command Facility]], consider equipping it. Activating it will cause you to possibly lose some amount of gauge you would otherwise reduce, but it is much better than not reducing the gauge at all.
**In addition, if you make it to the transport dropoff point and have to use the [[Fleet Command Facility]] afterwards in the following node, if you can score an A or S you will be rewarded in full regardless of the fleet members you needed to pull out.

*Recommended Fleet composition:

**Carrier Task Force: (For Farming) 2BB/2CL/2CV+2DD/1CL/1FBB/2CA
**Carrier Task Force: (For Final Kill) 2BB/2CL/2CV+2DD/1CL/2CLT/1CA
**Surface Task Force: (For Taking down the Installation buff points) 2BB/2CA (include Maya Kai Ni)/1CL/1CV + 1 CL/2DD/1FBB/2CA
**For the installation battles it might be wise to have some way for some of your ships to fight the Patrol Boat  Imp Groups that will come with the Installations. Have a proper balance between installation killing and PT imp removal.  
***The Four-slot CLs ([[Yuubari]] and [[Ooyodo]] after reaching Kai) are very useful as they can equip more ASW equipment than other ships of their kind and so have the potential to hit the boss harder. 
***It is important to keep a certain amount of firepower reserved for enemies other than the boss. As such, BBV are not recommended, and CLT are very useful (as they will only target surface ships with a [[Type A Ko-hyoteki|Type A Midgetsub]] for great amounts of damage). 
***[[Maya#Second Upgrade|Maya Kai Ni]] is useful as she can cover Anti-Air Cut In duties for Destroyers who are put to better use in an ASW role.
***Submarines (both friendly and hostile) do not get normal night battle protection on Combined Fleet maps. Do not be afraid of entering night battle if you only need to do a little bit more damage.
* Nodes J and M are armor reduction nodes which you can attack to reduce the armor of the Submarine Hime. You have to defeat the installation bosses at each node once for the effects to take place.
** On easy and normal, you probably will be able to defeat the Submarine Hime without reducing her armor, but on hard, you may want to consider the option of attacking those points.
** You will need to use a Carrier Task Force and make it to the boss for the debuffs to take effect. 
***Using a Surface Task Force will activate the debuff when you fight the Submarine Hime, however it is not visually shown through her introduction lines, but when you fight her. She does however seem to be somewhat agile in comparison to Carrier Task Force. This is possibly related to how the combine mechanics work between CTF and STF.
**After defeating these two installations, the submarine hime's dialogue will change and the glow of her torpedoes will emit a green light instead of a blue one.
**Armor buff will reset daily at 5 AM JST.
*If you are hunting for Prinz Eugen on Node M, she can be found regardless of formation on Normal and higher Difficulty. On Easy mode however, it might be restricted to the Line Ahead Formation.

*Both Supply and HP Gauge are present.
**Supply Gauge: 360 (Hard), 240 (Med), 120 (Easy)
***'''Supply gauge must be emptied before HP gauge can be depleted.
***The supply gauge drops by 18 per win, +3.5 per [[Drum Canister]] equipped, +5.5 per [[Daihatsu-class Landing Craft]] equipped. The decrease is increased by 44% if you score an S-rank victory instead of just an A-rank victory.
**HP Gauge: 1060 (Hard), 4 Kills (Med), 3 Kills (Easy)
***Flagship must be sunk for HP Gauge to be depleted (as usual).
**Resetting the difficulty will restore '''both''' gauges completely.
 
*Rewards upon clearance: [[Hagikaze]]
** Clearing on Hard (甲): [[Blueprint|Medal]] x2, Hard Mode Medal
** Clearing on Medium (乙): [[Blueprint|Medal]] x2

*There are in this event, which consist of a transport phase and a battle phase
** Doing the PT debuff before you complete the transport phase will have no effect on the [[Destroyer Water Demon]].
*[[Shigure]], [[Kawakaze]] and [[Sendai]] are needed for branching; this skips a sub node and allows the ACG route. Without the third ship, [[Shigure]] and either of the other two go through ACEH, which contains [[PT Imp Group]]s.
* If you use only Shigure, you will go the ACFG route which is a good way to bypass the [[PT Imp Group]]s or another night battle node at the cost of a fuel.
* If you use none of the ships, you will go ACFI which will have you engage in a total of 3 night battles which is not recommended.

*A LoS of 15 or greater is required to reach the boss node. Having four radars is recommended for this.
**Some reports have LoS's as low as 8 able to reach the boss node, but this does not guarantee a route fix. 
*The Destroyer Water Demon has rather high armor making her hard to take down. You will need to debuff her armor to make it possible to beat her more easily. To do this, you will need to destroy 15 [[PT Imp Group]]s ''while you're on the HP (red) gauge''. If done correctly, when you confront the Destroyer Water Demon, her abyssal helmet will be removed from her head indicating she has lost her armor. Remember that the debuff resets at 5 AM JST (except on the last day).
