===Tips===
* This map will consist of 2 phases:
**Part 1: Submarine Boss (Node G), 3 kills to clear.
***Part 1 must be cleared before Part 2 of the map (every node linked to Node D) can be unlocked.
**Part 2: Carrier Boss (Node M), 4 kills to clear.
* This map will reset at the end of each month, locking out Part 2 and resetting both boss HP bars.
**Once the map has been cleared for the month, the enemy composition for the second boss (Node M) will be locked to the easiest comp (Formation 1), which contains Nu-class elite, Ne-class base and Tsu-class base, until the next reset.

====<u>Part 1: Eliminate the Submarine Fleet</u>====
* The submarine boss fleet will usually consist of 3 subs, a Transport, and 2 DDs.
** Defeat the flagship of the submarine fleet 3 times to open up the path to the 2nd part of the map.
*'''Recommended Fleet'''
**'''1 CVL (Preferable CVE [ASW CVL]) 3 DD / 1 CL 3 DD / 2 CVL 3 DE''' routes '''CEG'''
***Fleet will need to be ASW-focused, however if you require S ranks (3 x S ranks are required for [[Quests#Bq8|Bq8]]), using 1-2 ships with ASW/combat hybrid set-ups can be helpful.
***If you have [[Suzuya]] or [[Kumano]] in their CVL forms, their unique ability may be useful as well. (They prioritise attacking surface units over submarines, unlike other CVLs.)

====<u>Part 2: Eliminate the Carrier Fleet</u>====
*Boss Fleet consists of a Wo Flagship Kai along with a Nu-class Elite, Flagship or Flagship Kai variant, a Ne-class elite CA, a Tsu-class and some DDs.
**Carefully managing your fleet's air power with strong planes can help either achieve AS or prevent the enemy from achieving AS.
**Using an AACI DD might be helpful for minimizing possible damage taken. 
**Defeat the flagship of the Carrier fleet 4 times to complete the map.
*'''Recommended Fleet'''
**'''1 FBB 1 CV 1 CVL 1 CAV 2 DD''' routes '''BCDIM'''
***Most battles will involve surface fleets where you'll face DD, CL and some CA.
*** Using a FBB can make getting up to the boss node relatively easier, but your fleet will need to be all fast to reach the boss node.
