==Trivia==
*The origins of the name are unclear, although it is probably from the Elizabethan spelling of the word 'spite' - i.e. 'spight' - in part embodying contempt for the Navy's enemies, but which was also the common name for the green woodpecker, suggesting the 'Warspight' would poke holes in enemy ships' (wooden) hulls. Until 1919 a woodpecker was used as the ships' crest; the official badge was a cannon, although the woodpecker continued to be used on the ships' tompions or gun muzzle plugs.
**She is the 6th ship to bear the name.
* Her pronounciation of "Admiral" is old fashioned.
