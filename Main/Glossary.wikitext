;Note:
* In Kancolle, "coastal defense ships" are labeled as "DE" and "destroyers escort" as DD and not DE.
* The term {{nihongo|''Kūbo''|空母}} is a shorthand for {{nihongo|''Kōkū bokan''|航空母艦}}, which means "Aircraft Carrier".
* In-game, the cards & encyclopedia have the ship class English Name, but some are rendered differently from above.
:* "Aircraft Carrying Submarine" instead of "Submarine Aircraft Carrier"
:* "Aircraft Cruiser" instead of "Aviation Cruiser"
:* "Seaplane Carrier" instead of "Seaplane Tender"
:* "Aircraft Carrier" instead of "Standard Aircraft Carrier"
:* "Aircraft Carrier" instead of "Armored Aircraft Carrier"
:* "Battleship" instead of "Fast Battleship"
* There are no USN hull classification codes for:
:* Submarine Aircraft Carriers
:* Training Cruisers
:* Torpedo Cruisers
:* Aviation Cruisers
:* Armored Carriers
::* KanColle fans occasionally use CVB, which was for the largest aircraft carriers, such as Shinano.
:* Fast Battleships
:* Aviation Battleships
:* Landing Craft Carriers (Amphibious Assault Ship)

==General==
===API link===
{{details|Tutorial: Proxy Connection#Play_without_VPN.2FProxy|l1=Play without VPN/Proxy}}
A method to play the game without having to access the official [http://www.dmm.com/ DMM] website.

===Crossing the T===
Classic naval strategy in which a line of warships cross in front of a line formation of enemy ships, allowing the crossing line to bring all their guns to bear while receiving fire from only the forward guns of the enemy. Gameplay-wise, when your fleet crosses the enemy fleet, both sides (counter-intuitively) gain a significant increase in firepower. When the opponent crosses your fleet, both sides receive a significant firepower debuff. 

===Docking===
{{details|Docking}}
This allows your damaged ships to be repaired to full health by consuming steel and fuel. You can use an instant repair (高速修復材) to immediately finish.

===Expedition===
{{details|Expedition}}
This is where you send your fleets to complete expeditions, in exchange for resources and certain items. Certain ships and equipment can be obtained exclusively through expeditions.

===Food supply ship Mamiya===
[[File:Mamiya_blinking_icon.png|thumb|Blinking button in the 'Organize' menu showing that Mamiya's food can be used.]]
{{details|Morale/Fatigue}}
This item removes any fatigue on your fleet. See [[wikipedia:Japanese food supply ship Mamiya|here]] for the Wikipedia entry.

===Modernization===
{{details|Modernization}}
The process of using spare ships to increase the stats (firepower, AA, torpedo, armor) of ships up to a certain point. Luck can also be modernized with [[Maruyu]], but she is difficult to obtain. 

===Naval Exercise===
{{details|Exercises (PvP)}}
These are battles against other players' fleets. Opposing teams update in real-time, but there is no simultaneous play.
*New opponent list refreshed at 03:00 and 15:00 JST

===Phases of Battle===
{{details|Combat#Combat_Stages|l1=Combat}}
*Day Battle
*#Reconnaissance (Stat boost, avoid being [[#Crossing the T|T-crossed]])
*#Initial airstrike (opening bombing, air superiority)
*#Support fleet attack
*#Opening/initial torpedo strike (see [[#Midget Submarine|Type A Ko-hyoteki (甲標的甲型)]])
*#Shelling/artillery phase (regular airstrike happens here)
*#Torpedo salvo
*Night Battle

===Remodel===
{{details|Remodel}}
Often confused with Modernization, will usually result in *ship name*-Kai (改). also known as Upgrading.

===Fatigue===
{{details|Tutorial: FAQ#Alright, I built my ship, kicked some ass and I noticed the orange faces. What gives?|l1=Alright, I built my ship, kicked some ass and I noticed the orange faces. What gives?}}
Orange/sad faces are displayed next to the ship icon if they are too fatigued. Rest them for 15 minutes or so if it happens. Fatigue will reduce by 3 every 3 minutes. Fatigued ships will have lower accuracy and evasion. If your ships are still fatigued upon returning from expedition, your '''expedition will end up failing even with all other criteria fulfilled.'''

===Sparkle===
{{details|Tutorial: FAQ#My ship is sparkling.2Fglittering.21|l1=My ship is sparkling/glittering!}}
The polar opposite of Fatigue. If one or more of your ships sparkle, they will gain evasion boost during sortie. The evasion boost stats are not shown in your ship stats directly. Or, if you choose to send a sparkling ship on an expedition, it will have a chance for 150% resource gain and a higher likelihood of returning with a special item (note that this requires the entire fleet to be consisting of sparkling ships).

===Medal===
{{details|Blueprint}}
{{nihongo|Medals|勲章}} are a multi-purpose item that can be used to exchange for a small amount of resources or a {{nihongo|remodel blueprint|改装設計図}}.
*1 medal can be used to exchange for {{Fuel}} x300, {{Ammo}} x300, {{Steel}} x300, {{Bauxite}} x300 and {{IR}} x2.
*1 medal can also be used to exchange for '''Improvement Materials [[File:Improvement_Materials.png|20x20px]] x4.'''
*4 medals are needed to exchange for 1 x remodel blueprint.
Medals can be obtained by clearing certain maps. You can find the amount of medals owned by accessing the Item page(アイテム) at the top menu bar of the main screen. Remodel blueprint is needed to remodel certain ships.

===Tracer-fire effect===
This occurs when a ship fires any equipped machine guns to defend itself, reducing incoming damage from enemy bombers. Your flagship will always do this by default, even without any anti-air stat.

==IJN ship-naming conventions==
*'''Destroyers '''are named after natural phenomena, often snow (<span style="text-align:center;">雪, </span>"-yuki"), waves (<span style="text-align:center;">波, </span>"-nami"), rain (<span style="text-align:center;">雨, </span>"-ame", "-are"), wind (<span style="text-align:center;">風, </span>"-kaze"), clouds (<span style="text-align:center;">雲, </span>"-kumo" or "-gumo"), the moon (<span style="text-align:center;">月</span>, "-tsuki" or "-zuki") or tides (<span style="text-align:center;">潮, </span>"-shio").
*'''Light Cruisers''' are named after rivers.
*'''Heavy Cruisers''' are named after mountains.
**Exceptions: The [[Mogami]] class were originally designed as Light Cruisers before being extensively modified into Heavy Cruisers (and later Aviation Cruisers), and so are named after rivers.  The Tone class also, being more lightly armed than the Takao or Myoukou classes, were also named after rivers.
*'''Battleships '''are named after provinces.
**Exceptions:  The [[Kongou]] class were originally designed as Battlecruisers, which were named after mountains before "heavy cruiser" became a separately defined class from simply "cruiser".
*'''Aircraft Carriers''' all have the character for "dragon" (<span style="text-align:center;">龍, </span>"ryuu"), "phoenix" (<span style="text-align:center;">鳳</span>, "hou"), "crane" (<span style="text-align:center;white-space:nowrap;">鶴</span>, "kaku") or "falcon" (<span style="text-align:center;">鷹</span>, "you") in them.  Light carriers tend to have "falcon" or "phoenix" names, where Fleet carriers tend to have "dragon" or "crane" names, but this is not strict.
**Exceptions:  [[Akagi]] and [[Kaga]] were originally designed as a battlecruiser and a battleship, respectively, and follow those classes' naming conventions instead (Akagi is named after a mountain, Kaga is named after a province).  [[Chitose]] and [[Chiyoda]] were not originally aircraft carriers, their names are poetic words for "millenium".
**While [[Taigei]]'s name was changed to fit in with the standard Aircraft Carrier naming scheme ("Ryuuhou" means "Dragon Phoenix") when she was remodeled into an Aircraft Carrier, neither Chitose nor Chiyoda received the same treatment when they were remodeled.
*'''Submarines '''are simply given operating numbers in the same manner as German U-boats, following a syllable of the word 'Iroha'.  All long-range submarines were designated 'I-' (such as all the submarines present in KanColle), where coastal subs began with 'Ro' and training submarines were 'Ha-'  In Kancolle, the submarine girls use the classical japanese number syllables (or just the number directly, in [[I-8]]'s case) to make their numbers sound more name-like.
*'''Submarine Tenders '''were a varied group of ships.  Several of these had the character for "whale" (鯨, "gei") in their names, but many did not.
**Shouhou and Zuihou were originally designed as Submarine Tenders before being converted into Light Carriers.  Like Ryuuhou, their names were changed upon conversion, they were originally named Tsurugizaki and Takasaki.
*'''<nowiki>Non-Navy Ships'</nowiki>''' names were often appended with "Maru" (丸) the character for 'circle'.  The reason for this tradition seems to have been lost to time, but may be related to the red circle being the symbol and flag of japan (the "hi-no-maru") or as a superstition, helping ships travel a circle of going out to sea and returning home.
**The examples in KanColle are "[[Akitsumaru]]" (an Army ship) and both [[Hiyou]] and [[Junyou]]'s names before they were converted to aircraft carriers: Izumo Maru and Kashiwara Maru.
**The "maru" in "[[Maruyu]]" is a reference to this character, but does not actually appear in her name, which is a circle around the hiragana character 'yu'.
*[[Akashi]] was named after the Akashi Strait, near Kobe.  Since she was the only repair ship built for the IJN, the naming conventions of her class are unclear.


The Abyssal fleet's 'classes' are the based on the [[wikipedia:Iroha|Iroha]], a classical Japanese alphabetical ordering.  That this is classical Japanese implies that the classes are externally ascribed to the Abyssal fleet ships, especially combined with the highly descriptive names for the bosses.

==Trivia==
===！すでのな===
One of [[Inazuma]]'s lines written "backwards", in traditional Japanese format. Also appears as a wall scroll in the furniture page.

===2-4-11===
[[Naka]]. 2-4-11 refers to the fuel/ammo/steel combination received from her scrap (if scrapping with her default equipment).

===Beaver or YKKZ===
A nickname for [[Yukikaze]] based on her appearance. Japanese fans call her 'Hamster' instead.

===Big Seven===

* Abbreviated BRS

===Black Wock Shooter===
Nickname of [[Standard_Carrier_Wo-Class#Kai_Flagship|Standard Carrier Wo-Class Kai Flagship]].
* Abbreviated BWS

===BURNING LOVE===
Notable line from [[Kongou]], a [[:Category:Kongou_Class|Kongou-class]] battleship built by Vickers Shipbuilding Company. Loves tea and fond of using English words due to her being built in England.
Other examples:
* 提督ゥ～、You've Got Mail! Love letterは許さないからネ!
* Wow! Congratulations!
* Tea timeは大事にしないとネー

===KTKM===
Shorthand for [[Kitakami]]. Wordplay from Japanese netslang KTKR which is read as ''kita kore'', literally 'it's here', sort of like 'woohoo I got it' or 'I've been waiting for this!'.

===Melon-chan===
Nickname for [[Yuubari]] due to her uniform color scheme and general resemblance to a melon as well as the City of Yuubari, on the namesake Yuubari River, which is well known for its melons.

===Nagamon===
The name is due to [[Nagato]]'s (長門) second kanji, 門, which can be pronounced as ''mon''.<br />
Instead of being cool and serious, Nagato is usually depicted doing silly things or showing love to random destroyers, Northern Hime, and other girls.

===Rensouhou-chan (連装砲ちゃん)===
A Danbo-like robot which appears with [[Shimakaze]]. [[Amatsukaze]], having a more formal character, calls hers Rensouhou-kun instead.

===RJ===
Light Carrier [[Ryujo|Ryūjō]].

===Tenryuu Kindergarten===
A common theme where [[Tenryuu]] and her destroyers escort was regularly used in expeditions due to Tenryuu's lower ammo cost (compared to other light cruisers). The official 4-koma also shows Tenryuu as being good at taking care of children (destroyers), hence the name.

===Whale===
Refer to [[Taigei]] and [[Jingei]], both having the kanji "鯨" meaning whale in their name.

===Zekamashi (ぜかまし)===
[[Shimakaze]]'s name read backward (in traditional Japanese, characters are read right-to-left). Found on one of the Rensouhou-chan's life buoys.

== Birthdays of Ship Girls ==
The date a ship was launched is traditionally used as a ship's birthday; the dates presented here reflect this. These dates are sourced from Wikipedia.
