==Sandbox Rules==
This sandbox is to be used to construct an event guide for the above mentioned event map. These guides are to all of the following requirements:

* List of branching unlocking requirements (If there are multiple requirements, compositions for each path along with the below requirements will be needed to discuss the unlocking requirements in question)

* A list of working compositions that work: (These must have possible alternatives for players who may or may not have all ships needed for a specific path)

* The Path said composition will take (To explain what path the composition will take)

* A summary or description of what kind of obstacles a composition will face.

* A description of the boss node, what it consist and a descriptive guide on what the player should consider for a course of action to successfully win the battle.

* (Optional) Tips to farm to take path to collect certain ships (This will also require a composition, path, and possible description.

Editors are to construct thier own version of thier guide and complete them in a timely fashion. 

No other editors are to allowed to edit over other editor's work without the full consent of the editor and his approval to do so. 

Several version will be constructed through this page and will be reviewed and approved by the staff/ collaboration committee before being moved for the [[Sandbox/Summer 2018 Event|Event Page Sandbox]] which it'll be reviewed and updated once more before it can be released.

Overall there will be 3 version of the guide that will be constructed which will include:

*Preliminary Guide
*Polished Guide
*Finalized Guide

With each approval of each version the guide, the said guide will be updated to the main page and construction of the next version will begin.

All guides outside of the approved version will be removed and work will begin from the approved version to make it better for the next version until the finalized version is made.


===Totaku's Proposal===

'''About Ambush Nodes'''
[[File:Ambush Nodes.png|right|thumb|ambush node]]
On this event map, player will get to experience a new mechanic known as an '''Enemy Ambush Node'''.
There nodes are generally encountered only if your fleet meet specific conditions which redirect them along a path to this node. Similar to the way LoS check are done in maps. 

For this event, '''Ambush Nodes''' mainly occur if your fleet does not meet the Surface Radar requirements and if you land on one, you will enter a battle.

During these battle, your fleet will not participate in attacking the enemy fleet, but the enemy will attempt to attack your fleet. Your will consume 4% of it's total fuel in the sequence. 

It's recommended to try to do what you can to avoid hitting these nodes as much as possible. 

This map is divided into 2 phase, a Transportation phase and a Killing phase. Both objectives will need to be completed in order to complete this map. 

Most battle in this map mainly consist of simple fights which will pit your fleet up to 4 enemy ships mainly consisting of subs, DDs or CLs mixed with DDs. Most of these fights can be won easily, espcially with an expeirenced fleet. For this guide, the focus will be on the boss nodes and requirements needed for completing the objectives.


'''Phase 1- Transportation through the Blackket Strait'''

'''Recommended Composition'''

'''1 CL, 4 DD or 5 DD'''

'''Route: B-C-E-F-G'''

Have your fleet drum and Daihatsu, but keep a balance between combat and TP gear to get the best outcome to deplete the TP gauge. The TP phase here is small so completing should only take a short while to do. 

Boss is a Tsu-class with Destroyers and should be overall easy to S rank if you equip your fleet properly. It is also possible to use a Boss support fleet here and load your fleet with only drums and Daihatsu to maximize your TP gain which cam make it possible to complete it in as short as 2 runs.

'''Phase 2 - Battle Against the Abyssal Nimbus Princess'''

'''Recommended Composition'''

'''Casual - 2 CAV, 1CLT, 4 DD'''<br>
'''Easy - 1 CAV, 1 CLT, 4DD'''<br>
'''Normal and Hard - 1 CL, 5 DD (Surface Radars needed to complete the objective)'''

'''Route: B-H-C-L'''

To be able to reach the boss node, your fleet will need to have radars equipped to each of them, from those radars you will need a certain amount of Surface Radars equipped on your ships along with '''1 Surface Radar equipped on the flagship''' (5 Surface Radars overall needed) in order to reach Node L. 

Players on Easy and Casual will need heavier ships along with a '''flagship with a surface radar''' to being directed to the boss and avoid being tossed into the dead end node or getting stuck in ambush nodes. Easy will need 1 CA(V)+CLT while Casual will need 2 CAV+1CLT.

Once your fleet reached the boss will battle the [[Abyssal Nimbus Princess]] who will consist of herself + 3 CL and 2 other DDs. The fight is simple, but having a Boss Support Fleet will help make it easier to concentrate on attacking the boss herself. As such, a ''' Boss Support Fleet''' is recommended for this map.

In addition to this, ships from the '''Asashio-class, Shiratsuyu-class , and Yura''' all can deliver a damage modifier to the Nimbus Princess which consist of a value of '''1.3x the normal damage value'''.

Murasame can deliver '''1.5x the normal damage value'''.

Bringing a few ships from this group should easily help you win the battle even with double attack shelling. However, if you face complication with the boss, bringing in a DD with Torpedo Cut ins can be an alternative.
