==Overview==
This article aims to provide you with a list of the most efficient places to quickly level your ship girls. '''It will only cover sorties'''. Generally [[Exercises]] are the most efficient way to level but is severely limited. 

[[Experience and Rank|Experience (XP)]] increases the level of ships, which leads to increases in [[Tutorial: FAQ#Equipment.2C_Stats_and_Remodels|Evasion]], [[Line of Sight|LOS]], and [[Tutorial: FAQ#Equipment.2C_Stats_and_Remodels|ASW]] stats, as well as passive increases in accuracy. Leveling ships can also unlock [[Remodel|remodels]] at higher levels.

This map is a good starting point for leveling DD, DE and CL. [[OASW]] is required to get the most out of this map. At higher HQ levels, the boss node contains a flagship submarine that can be difficult to sink in just 1 round of shelling. Furthermore, the submarines present will have opening torpedoes in the later nodes. Not having OASW means higher bucket usage.
<br>

BBV and CVL also have some use in this map. BBVs allow a 2nd round of shelling that can help weaker ASW ships secure a S-rank. CVLs can carry a [[Saiun]] to prevent RedT engagements from hampering your fleet's combat ability.

This map is not all that fantastic for experience, but it is the earliest map that is efficient for leveling heavier ships like BB, CA, CV and CVL. Air power is nearly nonexistent which allows your fleet to have a powerful opening strike that reduces your bucket cost. <br>

This map requires a minimum of 3 CV/L, allowing you to leech up to 3 other girls. The objective of this leveling method is to '''only hit node B andthe bauxite node'''. It doesn't give a lot of experience but it provides safe leveling. The resource cost is very low and it is even possible to get a refund on the bauxite cost. While it is possible to run this map at low morale, you will want to have more carriers to increase the chances the airstrike sinks all the enemy ships. This will reduce the bucket cost.<br>

This map is primarily for CV/Ls. The strategy is to load up on your best torpedo bombers and attempt to wipe the nodes before they send your fleet back to port. Be warned that this map costs an exorbitant amount of bauxite. Attempting to reduce the bauxite cost will increase the bucket cost.<br>

This map allows you to level any ship type as the flagship. '''You should retreat after node B'''. 3-4 enemies in the node will be forced to attack a submarine, allowing you to mitigate some damage taken. Note that those enemies have ASW equipment so the sub is unlikely to survive more than one battle. Because the airstrike will do most of the heavy lifting, it is possible to run this map with low morale ships. Beware that this will increase your bucket cost when the airstrike fails to take out enough enemy ships.<br>

This map is great for leveling CLs and DDs but the requirements are tight if you want to reduce bucket costs. At least 3-4 girls in the fleet must be capable of [[OASW]]. The fewer girls that are capable, the higher the bucket cost will be. Having a CL capable of opening strikes will help by increasing the pass rate at G.<br>

| This setup is for [[:Category:Agano Class|Agano-class]], [[Tama|Tama Kai Ni]] or [[Gotland|Gotland Kai]]. The seaplanes should be seaplane bombers. Good SPB like the [[Prototype Seiran]] are important to increase the pass rate. The [[Zuiun]] is not strong enough to reliably sink or disable enemies at G before closing torpedoes.
|-
| {{TorpedoWeapon}}{{Sonar}}{{DepthCharge}}
| This setup is limited to [[Abukuma|Abukuma Kai Ni]] and [[Yura|Yura Kai Ni]]. They are the best choice for CLs in this map. The opening torpedo is nearly guaranteed to kill at least one enemy at G which drastically increases your pass rate.

This section is for 7-1 phase 1 that terminates at node G. It is a decent map for leveling DE and CVL. The exp is lower than 1-5, but you can level 1 more girl. Ideally you will want all your girls to be capable of [[OASW]]. This will allow them to eliminate the submarine threats and take no damage in return.

This section is for 7-1 phase 1 that terminates at node M. It provides slightly more experience than 4-4 in exchange for harder fights. It is primarily for leveling BB, CV/L and CA. It also has a very steep fighter power requirement, which limits the effectiveness of the airstrike. Overall, it costs a lot more resources to run compared to 4-4.<br>

This map is primarily for leveling BB, CV/L, CA or CL. Unlike 7-1p2, it has no speed routing so a wider variety of girls can be used. It can get fairly costly depending on the setup used. It is not recommended to bring more than 1 leech for this map. The pre-boss nodes are fairly dangerous with the flagship Ri that will cause you to retreat. The boss herself has flagship Ta as escorts that will cost you buckets if you do not bring powerful enough girls.<br>

Out of the 3 "1st node submarine" maps, 4-5 is the 2nd best in terms of experience. It also has the added advantage of not being limited by fleet composition.

This is the cheapest and fastest way to level any aviation ship (BBV, CAV, CV/L and AV). The objective is to '''retreat after node C'''. The [[12cm 30 Tube Rocket Launcher Kai 2]] is mandatory to get the most out of this map. This map is a waste of time and resources if you do not have the Rocket k2. How many girls you can field at once is determined by how many rockets you have.

The wildcard can by anything that does not interfere with her double attack setup. This should enable her to take MVP most of the time.
|-
| {{TorpedoWeapon}}{{Radar}}{{SurfaceShipPersonnel}}
| This setup is for the '''escorting DDs'''. The cut-in that it triggers is low power, has a decent trigger rate even on low luck ships and the setup provides bonus evasion. It provides some much needed survivability and is still good enough to sink the enemies you'll encounter without outshining the flagship.
|-
| CL
| {{RedGunMedium}}{{Searchlight}}{{Seaplane}}'''/'''{{StarShell}}
| The CL should be powerful enough to take out enemy ships with a single attack. She should not have a double attack so that she doesn't steal MVP from the flagship. The [[Searchlight]] increases the chances that the escort DDs will perform their cut-ins. The seaplane must be a [[Type 98 Recon Seaplane (Night Scout)]]. If you are running a CA or BB flagship, the seaplane can be swapped with a [[Star Shell]]
|-
| CA/V
| {{RedGunMedium}}{{RedGunMedium}}{{Seaplane}}{{WildCard}}
| Like the CL, the seaplane must be a night scout. The wildcard can be anything that does not interfere with her double attack setup. She can even equip a star shell to increase the activation chance.
|-
| F/BB
| {{RedGunHeavy}}{{RedGunHeavy}}{{Seaplane}}{{RedAmmo}}
| Like the CL, the seaplane must be a night scout. This is a fairly standard setup for the BB otherwise.

|-|5-5=
Out of the 3 "1st node submarine" maps, 5-5 is the best in terms of experience. It's drawbacks are that you are limited to only 3DD and the enemy submarines are stronger, necessitating [[OASW]]. The objective is to '''retreat after node B'''. Like 4-5, morale quickly becomes an issue.<br>

'''Recommended Fleets'''
* 4-5OASW 1-2XX

'''Equipment Setups'''<br>

''Any girl not capable of ASW can just be equipped with anything. Bulges will help reduce the chances that opening torpedoes will damage them.''

| {{BluePlane}}{{Autogyro}}{{ASWPlane}}{{YellowPlane}}

|-

|-|6-5=

Out of the 3 "1st node submarine" maps, 6-5 is the worst in terms of experience. Unlike 4-5 and 5-5, you are also unable to bring BB, CV, or CLT. The only reason to run this map for experience is to rank your LBAS alongside. [[OASW]] is mandatory due to the strength of the enemy submarines. You can reduce the number of OASW girls in the fleet if you are running ASW planes in the LBAS.<br>

=General Tips=

* Maps heavily reward clearing them in full with the boss node being worth a significant portion of the map's exp. Unless otherwise noted, '''always clear the map'''.
* For details on how exp works, see [[Experience and Rank]].
** The flagship receives a 50% exp bonus. Have the girl you wish to level the fastest in that slot.
** MVP gives double XP. Can be combined with Flagship bonus for total of 3x bonus.
** S-ranks give 20% more exp. Losses have an exp penalty.
** It is good to proceed into night battle for boss nodes to attempt to turn a loss into a victory or A/B rank into S-rank.
*** Do not bother fighting SS in NB.
* Certain maps like [[#5-3|5-3]] allow you some control over who gets the MVP. Take full advantage of that to maximise efficiency by manipulating the flagship to get MVP.
* Unless otherwise noted, you need to watch the morale of your girls. Low morale will affect their combat ability and lower the pass rate.
* Leveling speed can be increased slightly by sortieing with full ship and/or equipment slots. This saves precious time not waiting for the drop animation to play out.
* Be sure to check the [[#Event|Event]] section when there is an event running for the latest leveling spot. Events generally allow you to level using a combined fleet.
* Do not be afraid to sortie your girls at <span style="color:orange;">'''moderate damage (中破)'''</span>. Unless they are severely underleveled and not modernised, they should be able to last a few runs before heavy damage. 
** A general rule of thumb is to leave a buffer of 10% max HP from <span style="color:red;">'''heavy damage (大破)'''</span>.
*Submarine, PT Imp, Airstrike and Night Battle nodes consume considerably less fuel and ammo than regular surface battle nodes
*[[Modernization]]: Improves the primary four stats of your ships. AA tends to be difficult to modernize but is generally the least important for farming XP. Firepower and armor can help the most. Stats gained during modernization are lost upon remodel, so typically modernization is used after the first remodel.

===Using Fodder Ships===
If maps require passing a dangerous node (like 5-3 I) first to get to the leveling spot, it is possible to exploit disposable escort ships that can be sunk during the sortie to save on buckets and time. Be aware that sinking Ships intentionally can generate quite a bit of hostility from other admirals. It is generally not recommended to utilize these strategies, but are included here for sake of completion of the guide. Be aware of the following:
*Equipment from sunk ships is permanently lost, do not use anything but the most basic equipment on them
*Losing Ships can affect Battle Ranks
*Unmodernized Level 1 ships with disposable equipment will struggle to make any meaningful contribution to the battle, which will also affect Battle Ranks
*Sinking Ships can also lead to failure to fulfil certain branching rules later on in the same map

===Submarine Tanks===
Also known as "Sub Tanks". This strategy is using SS to draw fire from enemy DD, CL, CVL and BBV. This can help preserve the rest of your fleet as they'll be taking less fire. SS have low sortie costs and are quick to repair when under level 40 and unremodeled. Do note that any enemy with ASW equips will make short work of low leveled SS.

=== Range ===
Range determines which ships attack first, which can help influence MVP. It is not possible to reduce the base range of a ship, but certain equipment is capable of extending it:
{| class="wikitable"

! Equipment !! Usecases
|-
| [[GFCS Mk.37]], [[SG Radar (Initial Model)]], [[Torpedo Squadron Skilled Lookouts]] || Medium Range on DD, CL

| [[203mm / 53 Twin Gun Mount]] || Long Range on CL, CA
|-
| [[381mm / 50 Triple Gun Mount|381mm / 50 Triple Gun Mount]] [[381mm / 50 Triple Gun Mount Kai|Kai]], [[46cm Triple Gun Mount]], [[46cm Triple Gun Mount Kai]] || Very Long Range on (F)BB(V)

| [[Night Operation Aviation Personnel + Skilled Deckhands]] || Long Range on CV(L/B)
|-
| [[Suisei Model 22 (634 Air Group)]], [[Suisei Model 22 (634 Air Group/Skilled)]], [[Ju 87 C Kai 2 (w/ KMX / Skilled)]]|| Long Range on CV(L/B)

The objective is to hit the sub nodes at K and L before retreating. If you're feeling adventurous, you can proceed to B or M for some extra exp. Be warned that the air raids will cost you more resources and repairs. As an added bonus, the sub nodes are only range 2 and 1 respectively. This makes it a good spot to re-rank your LBAS too. Fast CTF/STF will skip K and go straight to L.

'''Recommended Fleets'''
* Slow STF/CTF
* TCF
