|notes = ''CVL will require a dive bomber (red) or a torpedo bomber (blue) to attack SS, as they are unable to attack anything without a bomber.''
*[[Taigei]] and [[Akashi]] can equip this, but the former cannot attack SS, and the latter has carry capacity of 0 so autogyro does not function.
*[[Hayasui]] can equip this, but her attack motion will still be a depth charge motion.
*Will launch during aerial battle if other planes are launched, but cannot start aerial battle on its own.}}
