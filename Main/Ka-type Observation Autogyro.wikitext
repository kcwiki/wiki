==Introduction==
陸軍で開発、運用されていたオートジャイロ「カ号観測機」。<br>
現代の艦載ヘリコプターの先祖ともいえる、回転翼の艦載対潜哨戒機です。<br>
全通甲板を持つ強襲揚陸艦や軽空母、航空甲板を持つ航空巡洋艦などで運用可能です。

''The "Kayaba Ka-1 observation auto-gyro" was developed and used by the military.''<br>
''This rotor aircraft was used for anti-submarine patrol similar to modern ship-borne helicopters.''<br>
''This aircraft can launch from landing crafts and light carriers with full-length decks as well as from aviation cruisers and battleships with flight decks.''

==Notes==
CVL equipped with this plane will still require a dive bomber (red) or a torpedo bomber (blue) to attack SS, as they are unable to attack anything without a bomber.''

[[Taigei]] and [[Akashi]] can equip this, but the former cannot attack SS, and the latter has carry capacity of 0 so autogyro does not function.

[[Hayasui]] can equip this, but her attack animation will still be a depth charge animation.

Will launch during aerial battle if other planes are launched, but cannot start aerial battle on its own.
