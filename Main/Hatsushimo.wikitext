===Analysis===
'''Hatsushimo Kai'''

Priority: '''Low'''

:At first remodel, she has low firepower and a decent torpedo stat, making her hitting harder in night battle than at day, but not great at either.
:While not impressive in combat, do keep in mind than many maps require you to bring at least a few destroyers for routing.
:Furthermore, destroyers are cheap to deploy and can equip [[Drum Canister]], making them suited for expeditions.


'''Hatsushimo Kai Ni'''  

Priority: '''Medium-High'''
:Her second remodel gives her a sizable boost to Firepower, Torpedo, AA and ASW, making her all-around stronger in anti-surface combat and able to perform OASW at high-but-before-marriage levels with proper gear.
:Furthermore, her stellar 53 base luck means she's a really reliable choice for night battle cut-in attacks.


====Recommended Roles====
* Surface combat (Second remodel)
* Night battle (Second remodel)
* ASW (Second remodel)

===Important Information===
* Required for A48, A54, A85, B37, B38, B46, and C17.

==Trivia==
* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4aoVVloUBE&feature=youtu.be&t=52s Voices the beginning of the game's tutorial.]
* Mined and run aground, 30 July 1945 at Miyazu Bay, Kyoto (35°33′N 135°12′E) with the loss of seventeen sailors. Towed to Maizuru and scrapped in 1948.
** The last IJN destroyer to be lost in the Pacific War, outlasted in Kancolle only by the surviving [[Yukikaze]], [[Hibiki]], and [[Ushio]]. Generally she is not considered "sunk" as she does not meet the definition of the word; she was beached in critical condition rather than actually passing beneath the water's surface and scrapped around the same time as Ushio. For this reason she is sometimes included by fan-artists in group depictions of the surviving Kanmusu.
* Hatsushimo took part in Operation Ten-Ichi-Gō, Yamato's final mission, and took even less damage during it than Yukikaze, emerging unscathed with two sailors injured. By contrast she rescued approximately 310 people from the crews of the sinking [[Yahagi]] and [[Hamakaze]].
*Her name means "first frost of the year", often associated with the month November.
* An anchor was retrieved from her wreckage and is currently [https://www.google.co.jp/maps/@35.700884,139.801128,3a,21.7y,313.85h,84.8t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sobK61pe4i2PmS8lC2v0DoQ!2e0 displayed outside of the Yamada Memorial Hospital (Google Maps Street View)] in Sumida City, Tokyo. Dr. Masaaki Yamada, the founder of the hospital, was a ship's doctor of Hatsushimo. Interestingly, Yukikaze met a similar fate (she also ran aground and was memorialised via anchor, along with her rudder in Taiwan) after failed attempts to bring her full self back to Japan to be preserved as a museum ship.
* The hachimaki is a likely reference to her communication officer's recollection of Hatsushimo's crew at the moment Yamato sank, as described in Abe Saburou's book 特攻大和艦隊 (Tokkou Yamato Kantai, lit. Yamato Suicide Fleet): "Even now, Officer Matsui remembers clearly the faces of the hachimaki-donning troops, watching [her go down] with bitter expressions."
** The hachimaki's stripes are a reference to the famous Second Torpedo Squadron. Hatsushimo was not originally a member, but out of necessity and a general lack of ships, joined their ranks at the end of the war. The Second Torpedo Squadron was officially dissolved in a ceremony on her deck, on 20 April 1945.
* Japanese fans have pointed out that Hatsushimo's hair tie is similar to the one worn by [[Yahagi]]. Given that other destroyers have often been given articles of clothing similar to that of the larger ships whose survivors they rescued, it's entirely possible that this was intended from the start.
** The same has also been said of Hatsushimo Kai Ni's hachimaki, resembling Yahagi's tie in colouration. Whether her new (white) hair tie will have some future significance to Yahagi is undetermined, though she appeared in Kadokawa's magazine ''Comptiq'' [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B-menZ2UAAAGNwX.jpg with a red hair tie instead]. It is unknown which version is considered the final one.
*She is required by quests [[Quests#A48|A48]], [[Quests#B37|B37]] and [[Quests#B38|B38]].
