==Trivia==
This is essentially what should be called "Zuiun Kai", its engine replaced with 1500hp Kinsei (the Venus) type 62, a 200hp increase over the old engine's output. Notably, there was also a plan to swap the Zero fighter's engine with a Kinsei variant too, but ultimately neither of them was mass-produced before the end of war.
