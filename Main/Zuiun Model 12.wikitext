==Introduction==
急降下爆撃まで可能な多用水上偵察機「瑞雲」。<br />
空戦フラップ装備の高性能多用途機である本機のエンジンを、より強力な金星62型に換装した「瑞雲改良型」の新鋭機です。

''"Derived from floatplanes, Zuiun was developed as reconnaissance plane able to dive-bomb. This aircraft had its engine swapped to a more powerful Kinsei 62, being the latest upgraded version of Zuiun."''

This is essentially what should be called "Zuiun Kai", its engine replaced with 1500hp Kinsei (the Venus) type 62, a 200hp increase over the old engine's output. Notably, there was also a plan to swap the Zero fighter's engine with a Kinsei variant too, but ultimately neither of them was mass-produced before the end of war.
