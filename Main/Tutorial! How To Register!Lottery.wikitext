===Entering the Lottery===
Navigate to the [http://www.dmm.com/netgame/social/application/-/detail/=/app_id=854854/ game website] at the specified time to enter the lottery.

Here are tips from the staff to facilitate your lottery attempt:
*Before connecting to the site, clear your browser cache.
*Set your PC timezone to JST (UTC+09:00. 5 minutes time deviation is fine).

*Set your browser cache to at least 1024MB (''not mandatory, but recommended'').
**Windows Chrome: create another shortcut to Chrome (go to the program folder) and append its "Target" path (right click > Properties) with this at the end:{{Talkquote|text=
''<nowiki>chrome.exe" --disk-cache-size=1073741824</nowiki>''
}}
** Mac Chrome: create a .command file with the following command (Replace /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome with your app location):
{{Template:Talkquote|||text = #!/bin/sh

/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --disk-cache-size=1073741824 &
}}
* Remember to close your Chrome browser (Mac users must make sure it has quit) before restarting if you are changing your disk cache size.
* To verify the current disk cache size of your Chrome browser, go to this address:
**chrome://net-internals/#httpCache
**Look for '''Max size'''. It should now be '''1073741824'''.
*Once you reach the cat waiting screen (refer to top-left image below), refresh at the interval specified in each lottery post ([https://twitter.com/KanColle_STAFF/statuses/457099059388354560 Example], listing 3-5 minutes as the advised refresh interval); if none is provided, every 5-10 minutes is recommended.
**5分 (5 minutes); 10分 (10 minutes).
