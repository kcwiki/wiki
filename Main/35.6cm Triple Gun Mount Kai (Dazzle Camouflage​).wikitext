==Introduction==
「金剛」型高速戦艦の代替新造艦装備のために計画されていた三連装35.6cm主砲、その改二以降用if改良強化型兵装です。<br>
射撃精度が向上、効果のほどは不明ですが、最期まで呉軍港で防戦に努めた「榛名」前部主砲最終仕様と同様のゼブラ模様のダズル迷彩も施しています。

''This is a hypothetical Kai Ni triple gun mount of the 35.6 cm naval guns, planned as an brand new alternative armament for the Kongou-class fast battleships. It has improved accuracy, although the effectiveness is unclear. The final specification of the zebra-pattern dazzle camouflage on Haruna's fore turrets, with which she fought to the end at Kure, has also been applied.''

==Note==
Unlike most guns, the 35.6 cm Triple Gun Mount Kai (Dazzle Camouflage) gives special bonus benefits when equipped to [[Kongou]], [[Hiei]], [[Kirishima]] and [[Haruna]]'s Kai Ni forms which are as follows:

* [[Kongou]] Kai Ni: : +2 [[File:Icon_Gun.png]] , +1 [[File:Icon_AA.png]]
* [[Haruna]] Kai Ni: : +2 [[File:Icon_Gun.png]] , +2 [[File:Icon_AA.png]], +2 [[File:Icon_Evasion.png]]
* [[Hiei]] Kai Ni and [[Kirishima]] Kai Ni: +1 [[File:Icon_Gun.png]] 

When equipping this gun long with an Air Radar (that is not a [[Type 13 Air RADAR]]), the following bonuses are provided to the Kongou and Haruna:

* [[Kongou]] Kai Ni and [[Haruna]] Kai Ni: +2 [[File:Icon_Gun.png]], +2 [[File:Icon_Evasion.png]]

Overall, using the gun in combination with an air radar will provide [[Kongo]] and [[Haruna]] with the total overal bonus of: 

* [[Kongou]] Kai Ni: : +4 [[File:Icon_Gun.png]] , +1 [[File:Icon_AA.png]], +2 [[File:Icon_Evasion.png]]
* [[Haruna]] Kai Ni: : +4 [[File:Icon_Gun.png]] , +2 [[File:Icon_AA.png]], +4 [[File:Icon_Evasion.png]]

Stacking effect from multiple 35.6 cm Triple Gun Mount Kai (Dazzle Camouflage) is TBD.
