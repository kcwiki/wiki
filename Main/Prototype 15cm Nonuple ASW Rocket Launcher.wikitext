==Introduction==
爆雷投下軌条は艦の後方、従来型の三式爆雷投射機は艦の舷側方向に爆雷を投射可能でしたが、艦首方向にも爆雷を投射可能な新対潜装備が本噴進爆雷砲です。<br>
まだ、試作段階で欧米の同種兵装に比べて発展途上ではありますが、和製ヘッジホッグに発展する可能性もあった兵装です。

Depth charge launchers on ships' sterns and existing Type 3 depth charge projectors could throw depth charges to the sides of a ship, but this rocket launcher could throw depth charges ahead of the ship's bow as well.<br>
This system was still a mere prototype in comparison to Western developments of similar weaponry, but it had the potential to become something akin to a Japanese-made Hedgehog. 

==Note==
;Unbuildable.
:Ships receive a boost of 15% more ASW firepower when this is used together with a [[:Category:SONAR|SONAR]]. This equipment does not get the 10% bonus when used with a [[:Category:Depth Charges|depth charge]] or the 43% [[:Category:SONAR|SONAR]]+[[:Category:Depth Charges|DC]]+[[:Category:Depth Charge Projectors|DCP]] synergy bonus. However, since it's 15% [[:Category:SONAR|SONAR]] synergy bonus is unique, it can stack with the 43% bonus to give a total bonus of 64%. This is only possible on ships with 4 slots.
