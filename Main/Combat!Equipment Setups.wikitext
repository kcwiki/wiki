''See [[Combat/Artillery Spotting]] and [[Combat/Night Battle]] for details on how to trigger special attacks.''

Certain equipment setups are used to reliably trigger day-time [[combat/Artillery Spotting|artillery spotting]] or night-time cut-ins. This article displays most of the more common or particularly effective setups.

|General Use
|{{RedGunLight}}/{{GreenGunDP}}<br>Main Gun
|{{RedGunLight}}/{{GreenGunDP}}<br>Main Gun
|Auxiliary
<!-- | - -->
|[[12.7cm Twin Mount Type-B Kai 2]] can be substituted for [[10cm Twin High-angle Mount]]s, and are especially effective after being improved and equipped onto a high-firepower destroyer like [[Yuudachi]] or [[Ayanami]]. Otherwise, [[10cm Twin High-angle Mount]]s or [[10cm Twin High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]]s are preferred for their fleet AA defense modifier, though the latter is difficult to obtain.

|High-Luck Night Battle
|{{TorpedoWeapon}}Torpedo
|{{TorpedoWeapon}}Torpedo
|{{TorpedoWeapon}}Torpedo<br>''or'' Auxiliary
<!-- | - -->
| Auxiliary equipment are typically equipped on destroyers; however, luck-based destroyers benefit the most from adding an additional torpedo to their equipment in terms of night battle damage output... Candidates for night battle cut-ins without [[Maruyu|luck modernization]] include: [[Yukikaze]], [[Hatsushimo]], [[Shigure]], [[Ayanami]], and [[Ushio]].

|{{DepthCharge}}<br>Depth Charge
<!-- | - -->
|On maps with few subs, or where you don't need to kill the subs, two main guns and a sonar in the third slot are useful.

|Anti-Air Cut-In
|{{GreenGunDP}}High-angle Gun
|{{AntiAircraftFireDirector}}<br>Anti-Aircraft Fire Director
|{{Radar}}<br>Anti-Air RADAR<br>''or''<br>{{GreenGunDP}}High-angle Gun
<!-- | - -->
|Using an Air RADAR increases the effect of the anti-air cut-in at the cost of night battle damage (cannot perform double attack with only 1 gun equipped).

|[[Yuudachi]]/[[Ayanami]]
|{{GreenGunDP}}/{{RedGunLight}}<br>Main Gun
|{{GreenGunDP}}/{{RedGunLight}}<br>Main Gun
|{{Radar}}RADAR
<!-- | - -->
|These two have high firepower, so they are typically equipped with guns. Priority equipment includes [[12.7cm Twin Mount Type-B Kai 2]] and [[10cm Twin High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director]], or any improved small caliber main guns.
|-
|[[Hatsushimo]]/[[Shigure]]
|{{TorpedoWeapon}}<br>Torpedo
|{{GreenGunDP}}<br>High-angle Gun
|{{AntiAircraftFireDirector}}<br>Anti-Aircraft Fire Director
<!-- | - -->
|Ships boasting both high luck and AA can also be outfitted for mixed cut-ins instead of torpedo to better utilize their AA capability at the cost of lower effectiveness of the cut-in attack (both chance-to-activate and damage).
|-
|[[Akizuki]]/[[Teruzuki]]
|{{GreenGunDP}}<br>High-angle Gun
|{{GreenGunDP}}<br>High-angle Gun
|{{Radar}}Anti-Air RADAR
<!-- | - -->
|[[Akizuki]] and [[Teruzuki]] can perform anti-air cut-ins without a fire director; they only need either two high-angle guns or a high-angle gun and an AA RADAR.
