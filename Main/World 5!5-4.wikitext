===Tips===
*You must sink the boss 5 times to clear the map.
*There are two routes you can go to beat the boss, north and south. 
**North route is occupied with [[Standard Carrier Wo-Class]] Flagship IV, who carries Hellcat Kai plane version, and [[Battleship Ta-Class]] Flagship, who has high evasion and accuracy. They can potentially damage any of your ships on the way to the boss if not evaded.
***Node C also has a pattern with 1-2 Enemy Submarines, sometimes in Line Ahead. You are recommended go Line Abreast against this Node (Heavy Ships such as BB/CV can handle all Surface Enemies in the Node even in this formation), and bring OASW capable Destroyers to deal with them.
***There is an '''LoS Check in L to go to the Boss Node''', requiring above eLoS '''(F33) Cn=2 of 60 or higher.'''
**South route, however, doesn't feature any enemy carrier at all, but instead, you have go through the night battle nodes like in 5-3 against enemy [[Heavy Cruiser Ri-Class]] and Late Model DDs
***Seaplane Fighters are required for this route if you wish to obtain Air Superiority at the boss node, as no CVs are allowed
***There is an '''LoS Check in M to go to the Boss Node'''. It is ignored if your fleet is '''Fast+'''. If your fleet is just '''Fast''' (and not '''Fast+'''), it requires above eLoS '''(F33) Cn=2 of 45 or higher.'''
*No matter which route you take, [[Light Cruiser Tsu-Class]] will nearly show up everywhere in this map. Therefore, If you are using a composition with CVs and go north route, you are recommended to use ones with high capacity aircraft slots, and place Bombers only in the Highest Capacity Slots on your CVs to avoid all of your Bombers getting shot down to 0 by the time you reach the Boss Node.
<br/>'''Recommended Fleet'''
*'''North : B - C - G - L - P'''
**2 BB(V) 2 DD 2 CV(B)
**2 BB(V) 2 CA(V) 2 CV(B)
*'''South : B - E - H - I - J - M - P (Requires Fast Fleet)'''
**1 fBB(V) 1 CLT 4 DD
**2 fBB(V)/CA(V) 1 CL 3 DD (Quest '''Bq6''')
*'''South : A - D - E/F - H - I - J - M - P'''
**3 CA(V) 1 CL 2 DD (Quest '''Bq6 / Bq7''', goes through node E)
**4 CA 2 CAV (Quest '''Bq7''', goes through node F)
