'''Kirin Bokukawauso Land''' was a collaboration being done between '''C2''' and '''Sanrio Puro Land'''. The Collaboration was intended to help drive up momentum of C2's newer mascot creations  '''Kirin Kai Ni''' and '''Bokukawauso''' that were made as part of a comedy gag piece but later too on a real mascot form once the fans loved their original appearance (See Zuiun/ Reppu Event for more details). This collaboration would also double to help promote Kantai Collection as well.

The collaboration was launched on '''February 15th, 2020''' and would last until '''February 22nd, 2020''' but was cancelled on the 22nd.

There were plans to also do a live event where several of the seiyuus would be attending the show, for both the 21st and 22rd of February. However, the final show was cancelled.

The reason for the cancellation of the final show and the event itself is due to the recent rises and concerns of [[Wikipedia:Covid-19|COVID-19]] virus that recently gaining traction in Japan.
