Despite problems with its engine and weight, it was finally completed, boasting as a high-perfomance, cutting edge, carrier-borne attack aircraft. The 601 Air Group in training transitioned into this type of aircraft. Well-maintained, this aircraft became the mainstay of the carrier attack group.''
