==Introduction==
現代にも系譜を繋ぐ水上機の名門が開発を手掛けた、空戦に特化した水上機「強風」。難航する本機開発の繋ぎとして投入された二式水戦の後継として、その登場が期待されました。期待された性能を発揮することはできませんでしたが、本機をベースに開発された「紫電改」は本土防空等に奮戦します。機体を熟成、各強度を改良強化した「強風改」として登場です！

The "Kyōfū" is a seaplane that was specialised for dogfights and built by a renowned manufacturer whose pedigree of seaplanes extends even to the present day. The plane was highly anticipated as a successor to the Type 2 Seaplane Fighter for which it was supposed to be a stopgap due to troubles during development. While its performance couldn't live up to the expectations, the "Shiden Kai", which was developed with this plane as the base, saw a lot of action by, for example, providing air defence for the mainland. And now it makes an appearance as "Kyōfū Kai", with a matured fuselage and all-around improvements!
