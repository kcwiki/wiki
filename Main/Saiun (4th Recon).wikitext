==Introduction==
「我ニ追イツク敵機無シ」。敵戦闘機の追随を許さない高速性を誇る俊足の高性能艦上偵察機「彩雲」。<br>
「彩雲」は悪化した戦況の中、敵情偵察に海上へと飛び立ちました。同機を装備した偵察第四飛行隊は、捷一号作戦正面のレイテ方面偵察、またその後は紫電改集中装備部隊「三四三空」の眼として活躍しました。

"No enemy fighter can catch us." The Saiun was a high-performance carrier-based reconnaissance plane - the high speed of its brilliant design ensured no enemy fighter could keep pace with it. <br>
The Saiun flew over the sea reconnoitering enemy movements as the war situation turned grim. The 4th Reconnaissance Squadron, equipped with these very planes, scouted out Leyte during Operation Sho I; afterward, they continued to play an important role as eyes for the 343rd Naval Air Group, who mainly flew the Shiden Kai.

==Note==
The quote is modified from an actual boast by a Saiun pilot, "No Grummans [Hellcats] can catch us."
