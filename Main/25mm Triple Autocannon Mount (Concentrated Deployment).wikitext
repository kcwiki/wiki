==Introduction==
増大する敵航空兵力の脅威に対抗するため、25mm高角機銃の三連装型を集中的に複数配備した、ハリネズミのような対空機銃兵装です。命中精度にも難があり、すぐに砲身が過熱してしまう25mm機銃ですが、集中運用することで個艦防空能力を高めます。 

"In order to counter the threat of increased enemy air forces , concentrated deployment of multiple [[25mm Triple Autocannon Mount|triple mount of 25mm high-angle guns]], this is a hedgehog-like anti-air machine gun weapon. Although there is an increase in accuracy, the 25mm machine guns can end up overheating quickly, but it does increase an individual ship's air-defense capability by concentrating firepower."
