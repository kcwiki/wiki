One of Satsuki's minor damage lines is …っつぅ！いったいじゃんかさぁ！  The existing translation ("it hurts") looks fine to me and I'm pretty sure that's more sentence-final units than most people ever throw onto a sentence, but I was wondering if someone more familiar with colloquial Japanese could fill me in if there's more I should know than the ways that じゃん, さぁ and か are used normally.

: That would be up to the TL board. Really, we've noticed a lot of these going on, and are going through each and every ship to check these. There's a whole list on Trello for every ship, and I think we've only gotten a dozen or so done for now, but more are being added every day.

:: I actually am the person signed up to do Satsuki's lines on the Trello, which is why I'm asking.  I asked there as well.  I'm happy to leave the line as is (or leave the project if better-qualified people want to take over) but I was hoping that one of the other translators would be able to help me out with questions here and there without my dumping everything onto them.
