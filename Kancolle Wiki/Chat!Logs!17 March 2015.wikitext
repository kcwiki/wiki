[05:08] <TScript> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
[05:08] <Magicrailgunner> you gain some, you lose some
[05:08] <Magicrailgunner> or... the other way around
[05:08] <Magicrailgunner> eh idk
[05:08] <Magicrailgunner> its not like it's crippling so i don't mind too much
[05:08] <Magicrailgunner> unless one day i need to run from zombies and remember that I can't
[05:09] <Dechidechi> ohh saku is drawing choukai oyako next time
[05:09] <RadarMatt> o.o
[05:09] <TScript> Chatlogger
[05:09] <TScript> Hime, what have you done
[05:09] <Magicrailgunner> I can't wait for choukai's K2 art
[05:09] <Ninthsense> why do we have chatlogger anyways
[05:09] <Sshinka> dammit gotta start leveling Chouki
[05:09] <Magicrailgunner> they did a good job with maya
[05:09] <Kevadu> To log chats
[05:09] <Dechidechi> to record our heavy breathings @ninth
[05:09] <RadarMatt> out of all the chats Ive been in, this one seems to me the one that need a logger least
[05:10] <Dechidechi> to record our exhibitionism in this chat
[05:10] <Reikyu> we're all responsible adults here
[05:10] <TScript> That moment when you get a taiha in 5-4 preboss
[05:10] <Ninthsense> i dont think its a good idea to public some of stuff we talk about
[05:10] <Decyl> Too late now
[05:10] <Dechidechi> there's no public its going
[05:10] <Dechidechi> we're famous worldwide nao
[05:11] <RadarMatt> www.dechidechi.com
[05:11] <Kevadu> All those KanColle wiki chat paparazzi
[05:11] <Dechidechi> www.ecchidechi.com *
[05:11] <TScript> McDerp moments
[05:12] <Kyzella> We will become memes?!
[05:12] <Dechidechi> if you try hard enough yes
[05:12] <Kyzella> Isn't that... internet fame at it's highest?
[05:12] <TScript> Maybe Ky, maybe
[05:12] <RadarMatt> le reddit maymay
[05:12] <RadarMatt> ecksdee
[05:12] <TScript> But don't do anything stupid
[05:12] <Magicrailgunner> i mean, you can become a meme like that one admiral that left his API out
[05:12] <Magicrailgunner> i remember that vividly
[05:12] <Segar> ima a meme
[05:12] <Nothis> lol i still remember that
[05:12] <RadarMatt> arar
[05:12] <Dechidechi> abrar?
[05:12] <TScript> Abrar
[05:12] <Nothis> yeah
[05:13] <Dechidechi> abrar's kongou?
[05:13] <Dechidechi> abrar's ntr?
[05:13] <Nothis> this is why you shouldn't use API too much
[05:13] <Kevadu> Abrar is a hero
[05:13] <Dechidechi> I use APi
[05:13] <Dechidechi> for 14+ months
[05:13] <Nothis> i don't
[05:13] <Kevadu> There's nothing wrong with using API
[05:13] <TScript> Oh wait, pvp doesn't reset until 1 hour later
[05:13] <Kevadu> Just don't be an idiot about it
[05:13] <Nothis> yeah
[05:13] <Dechidechi> just don't take picture
[05:13] <Reikyu> more like this is why you shouldn't screenshot your whole screen
[05:13] <Dechidechi> ez
[05:13] <Nothis> but cookie still safer
[05:14] <Ninthsense> or have network admin spying on your sites
[05:14] <Dechidechi> more like I dislike the printscreen button, its dumb
[05:14] <RadarMatt> <span class="me-username">* <span>RadarMatt</span></span> steals nothis' cookies
[05:14] <Nothis> fu D:
[05:14] <Kyzella> Couldn't he just have logged on DMM and get a new API though?
[05:14] <RadarMatt> &gt;:3
[05:14] <Dechidechi> I've been using photoshop too much that printscreen just doesn't capture the resolution i need
[05:14] <RadarMatt> <span class="me-username">* <span>RadarMatt</span></span> shares with kyzella
[05:14] <Ninthsense> i think it was too late
[05:15] <TScript> On 4chan, shit happens pretty quickly
[05:15] <Ninthsense> dechi no iretina monitor?
[05:15] <Decyl> He wasn't fast enough
[05:15] <Nothis> RIP rsc
[05:15] <Kevadu> A network admin spying on your traffic could figure out your API link regardless
[05:15] <Kyzella> <span class="me-username">* <span>Kyzella</span></span> accepts Radar openly
[05:15] <Dechidechi> still not enough @ninth
[05:15] <Dechidechi> the larger the resolution the better
[05:15] <Dechidechi> that's why I aim for getting the original picture source
[05:15] <CreamX> http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=49314538
[05:15] <Decyl> Always aim for higher resolution
[05:16] <Dechidechi> and the resolution quality
[05:16] <Decyl> Though a moot point with KC caps
[05:16] <Dechidechi> some can have higher resolution by poor quality
[05:16] <Dechidechi> oh BeLL the inazuma lover
[05:16] <RadarMatt> (nanodesu) 
[05:16] <Ninthsense> dechi what about vector?
[05:17] <Decyl> Vector is scalable, so it's fine
[05:17] <Dechidechi> ^
[05:17] <Dechidechi> BeLL is probably a gurl
[05:17] <Ninthsense> belldandy?
[05:17] <Decyl> I personally don't like a whole lot of vectors though
[05:17] <Dechidechi> the artist CreamX just linked
[05:17] <RadarMatt> beLLend
[05:17] <Dechidechi> that's her latest doujin
[05:17] <RadarMatt> hue
[05:18] <Ninthsense> seems more difficult to work with i guess
[05:18] <Dechidechi> BeLL is famous for her inazuma love and doujins
[05:18] <Dechidechi> her way of speech on twitter also reflects that of feminine attire
[05:18] <Decyl> Depends, people can work with it really fast and it can be easily to manipulate
[05:19] <Decyl> It can also be freaking huge (filesize)
[06:38] <Magicrailgunner> so you were gonna break the illusion...?
[06:38] <SerialConvort> Its just a play on words
[06:38] <SerialConvort> Wait
[06:38] <SerialConvort> https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10200272419889221&amp;set=p.10200272419889221&amp;type=1&amp;theater
[06:38] <CreamX> lel its better than tatsuta that iron ttk`s balls
[06:38] <SerialConvort> All the good points of burning love
[06:38] <Magicrailgunner> content unavailable
[06:39] <Magicrailgunner> and.. better than agano who plucked TTK's eyes out
[06:39] <Magicrailgunner> even though normal agano is cute
[06:39] <SerialConvort> Ikr
[06:39] <Magicrailgunner> i mean, it's pretty hard to discredit haruna, she's nearly perfect
[06:39] <Magicrailgunner> ideal personality and all that
[06:40] <Kitsuboshi> that agano was hot idk whats wrong with you guys
[06:40] <Kyzella> We like our eyeballs where they are, NTRoshi.
[06:40] <CreamX> ^
[06:40] <Kitsuboshi> psh
[06:40] <Magicrailgunner> yandere agano is very hot but i prefer my eyeballs to stay in my skull
[06:40] <Kitsuboshi> pansies
[06:40] <Risemiria> My Agano is't like that
[06:40] <Risemiria> isn't*
[06:40] <Kitsuboshi> simple
[06:40] <Magicrailgunner> agano doesn't need to go Itachimode and take my eyes 
[06:40] <Magicrailgunner> and keep them in a jar
[06:40] <Kitsuboshi> don't look at anyone else
[06:40] <Kitsuboshi> eyeballs stay
[06:41] <Risemiria> I have two waifus atm
[06:41] <Risemiria> ...
[06:41] <Kyzella> bigamy!
[06:41] <Kitsuboshi> also Haruna is alittle too derpy for me
[06:41] <CreamX> scrap her b4 that happens :&gt;
[06:41] <Magicrailgunner> derpy?
[06:41] <Magicrailgunner> what? how?
[06:41] <Risemiria> Eugen will keep me safe~
[06:41] <SerialConvort> Haruna has alot of good points
[06:42] <SerialConvort> But I just like Kongou for her points more
[06:42] <SerialConvort> :v
[06:42] <Kitsuboshi> don't worry from what I read Eugene shares all the time anyway
[06:42] <Kyzella> with bisco*
[06:42] <Magicrailgunner> i really like haruna's hourlies
[06:42] <Magicrailgunner> really forward 
[06:42] <Zel-melon> why the hell are 2 people arguing over a friggin spear?
[06:42] <Magicrailgunner> kongou, for all her burning love, is a little passive lol
[06:42] <SerialConvort> Spear?
[06:42] <SerialConvort> Hey passive aggressive is a good point :v
[06:43] <Magicrailgunner> <span class="me-username">* <span>Magicrailgunner</span></span> is marrying both kongou and haruna, so the point is moot
[06:43] <Magicrailgunner> hehehe
[06:43] <SerialConvort> She just wants to have tea time with the admiral
[06:43] <Kitsuboshi> i grew out of haruna
[06:43] <SerialConvort> And other things
[06:43] <Kitsuboshi> something about her bugs me and ya
[06:43] <Teriyakian> &gt;growing out of your girls
[06:43] <Magicrailgunner> kitsu, you'll learn to re-appreciate her
[06:43] <Teriyakian> disguSTING
[06:43] <Kitsuboshi> nope
[06:44] <Magicrailgunner> and yeah, growing out of your girls is... shameful
[06:44] <Kitsuboshi> she's derptastic fro me since getting k2
[06:44] <Kitsuboshi> soo the distance is growing
[06:44] <Magicrailgunner> what do you mean by derpy anyhow
[06:44] <SerialConvort> Its all about
[06:44] <SerialConvort> That YASEN
[06:44] <SerialConvort> Haruna gonna rek
[06:44] <Kitsuboshi> she's stupid

[06:44] <Kitsuboshi> this 2nd instance of derpy is TAiha'd fro every little thing
[06:44] <CreamX> derp always on standby . . 
[06:44] <Akios> <span class="me-username">* <span>Akios</span></span> has returned from intake of consumable resources
[06:44] <Dechidechi> WAIFU WAR
[06:45] <Teriyakian> i'm about to smack the ttk outta this boy
[06:45] <Risemiria> Haruna isn't really stupid...
[06:45] <Risemiria> The anime Haruna, sure, maybe...
[06:45] <Dechidechi> admit it, dechi best waifu
[06:45] <Magicrailgunner> you're not treating her right!
[06:45] <Magicrailgunner> haruna is unfailingly polite and open about her feelings to admiral
[06:45] <SerialConvort> Well
[06:45] <SerialConvort> Not really in the anime
[06:45] <Kitsuboshi> she seems so, then again i ahvne't looked at allot of work
[06:45] <Magicrailgunner> anime haruna is derpier but it was for laughs, cause Fubuki was playing the straight man
[06:45] <SerialConvort> Mostly all of them are derpy
[06:45] <Kyzella> Does being in flagship help AA CI?
[06:45] <Teriyakian> Anime TTK is a kuso :v
[06:45] <Magicrailgunner> anime TTK is theoretically dead
[06:45] <Dechidechi> if you listen to the hourlies, you know TTK only buys clothes for dechi
[06:46] <Magicrailgunner> 0500 haruna is in the same futon as admiral
[06:46] <Magicrailgunner> :D 
[06:46] <Dechidechi> dechi and TTK goes shopping together
[06:46] <Dechidechi> oh pls, dechi and TTK nap together after they shop
[06:46] <Kitsuboshi> ^
[06:46] <Kitsuboshi> I just get bitched at
[06:46] <Kitsuboshi> that's the marriage i'm in
[06:47] <Magicrailgunner> at least i'm not saying dechi is stupid
[06:47] <Magicrailgunner> no one should call other people's waifu stupid
[06:47] <Kitsuboshi> hence why i went for derpy first
[06:47] <SerialConvort> 1800 You get English Style Curry :v

[06:54] <SerialConvort> Changed "She may have feelings for her admiral as seen on her lines." to "She probably if not most definitely has feelings for her admiral as seen on her lines." cause that was giving me physical pain

[06:56] <Risemiria> <span class="me-username">* <span>Risemiria</span></span> slow claps

[07:09] <Kyzella> KTKM-samaaa
[07:09] <Magicrailgunner> well what if they married like 14 different ships
[07:09] <Magicrailgunner> love is equal
[07:09] <Magicrailgunner> all-encompassing
[07:09] <Magicrailgunner> teitoku unconditional love
[07:10] <Dechidechi> if you think about it, you can't have sex with 14 ships and survive
[07:10] <Kyzella> --is what leads to Agano taking eyeballs Magic
[07:10] <Kitsuboshi> Looking at naka causes that :p 
[07:10] <Akios> 1 ring to marry the dechi, 1 ring to bind him. 1 ring for dechi to give, and in the ecchi, bind him
[07:10] <Magicrailgunner> ^nice
[07:10] <Magicrailgunner> Hey if you're hydrated enough you could probably survive
[07:11] <Akios> Yeah there was that kid who died after ejaculating 42 times from a heart attack
[07:11] <Akios> Although there was that dude who died after having sex with 5 of his 6 wives :v
[07:11] <Akios> So maybe its a case-by-case basis
[07:11] <Dechidechi> and you guys believe you can serve the sexual desires of 14 waifus
[07:11] <Dechidechi> wut are you smoking
[07:11] <Dechidechi> can i have some?
[07:12] <Xol2000> dildos, lots of dildos
[07:12] <Kyzella> You can do it. But you
[07:12] <Kyzella> You'd just die after a day
[07:12] <Magicrailgunner> well i mean i won't be touching Hiei, that marriage is to placate kongou

[07:18] <Risemiria> actually I hear them called airsoft often here too
[07:18] <Kitsuboshi> yup they are
[07:20] <Magicrailgunner> lol no i was wondering why you'd spend 200 euro on airsoft cause you can pretty much buy a real gun for that much... kidna
[07:20] <Magicrailgunner> *kinda
[07:20] <McDerp> this is finland, you cant buy a gun just like that :V
[07:20] <McDerp> <span class="me-username">* <span>McDerp</span></span> does not have an SVD or an AK
[07:20] <Akios> o7
[07:20] <McDerp> <span class="me-username">* <span>McDerp</span></span> swears he doesnt
[07:20] <Gensui Hime> &gt;implying

[07:21] <McDerp> I only have swoooooords :V
[07:21] <Magicrailgunner> finland? you guys are doing naval exercises with Denmark right?
[07:21] <Magicrailgunner> 
[07:21] <McDerp> no :V
[07:21] <McDerp> because our navy is near nonexistent
[07:21] <McDerp> getting this: http://www.redwolfairsoft.com/redwolf/airsoft/Accessories_Silencers_Xcortech_X3300W_Advanced_BB_Control_System_Black.htm
[07:22] <Magicrailgunner> airsoft.. silencer?
[07:34] <McDerp> you mean the BB cut?
[07:34] <Magicrailgunner> ^the guy who cut BB bullet?
[07:35] <McDerp> because it is ultimate mistake to cut a bullet with a sword, more so with a katan
[07:35] <McDerp> you will utterly butcher the blade
[07:36] <McDerp> but yeah, the kilij is also a cavalry blade
[07:36] <Kitsuboshi> hmm derp seems to be our resident sword nut
[07:36] <McDerp> if it's meant to hurt people, I'm your man _(:3/ L)_
[07:36] <Kitsuboshi> haha
[07:36] <Magicrailgunner> in terms of historical blades I think the gladius was really cool, even if a little impractical in 1v1 combat
[07:36] <McDerp> I can also talk to you alot of about armor, lel
[07:37] <Akios> O shit
[07:37] <Kitsuboshi> the only bladed thing we have in our house is a tanto i think
[07:37] <McDerp> well, the roman's phased out their gladius for the spatha later
[07:37] <McDerp> it's just a longer gladius
[07:37] <Kitsuboshi> i don't need rome stuff
[07:37] <Kitsuboshi> anyuthing but rome stuff
[07:37] <Magicrailgunner> spatha was greek in design though, right?
greek cavalry
[07:37] <Kitsuboshi> brother is a latin teacher
[07:37] <McDerp> romans fought with shield and spear, like hoplites of greece (which they based themselves on)
[07:37] <Magicrailgunner> <span class="me-username">* <span>Magicrailgunner</span></span> is googling
[07:37] <Kitsuboshi> i've had my fill of rome things
[07:37] <Magicrailgunner> nope it was roman
[07:38] <McDerp> greeks liked xiphos
[07:38] <McDerp> aka gladius
[07:38] <Kitsuboshi> ^
[07:38] <Magicrailgunner> the phalanx was cool
i imagine many a foe shit themselves watching the forest of pikes
[07:38] <McDerp> advancements into metallurgy and blacksmithing enables swords to become larger and longer :V
[07:38] <McDerp> aye c:
[07:38] <Magicrailgunner> so like the crusader swords? 
[07:38] <McDerp> err hang on
[07:38] <Kitsuboshi> sucks to be that short guy in the fomration though :p 
[07:38] <McDerp> crusader sword? :V
[07:39] <Magicrailgunner> i heard crusaders could cut an armored foe in half if they could swing right
[07:39] <McDerp> nah, the phalanx favoured all men of all highs :V
[07:39] <Magicrailgunner> idk it was forum talk so it might be BS
[07:39] <McDerp> impossibru, you cant slice a man in half
[07:39] <Magicrailgunner> lol then it was BS
[07:39] <McDerp> and if it was a crusader sword then lol, even more no
[07:39] <McDerp> crusaders used one hand swords that weighted 1kg at best
[07:39] <Kitsuboshi> hmm
[07:40] <Kitsuboshi> oh botkun is visible
[07:40] <Risemiria> yes
[07:40] <Kitsuboshi> wasn't expecting that
[07:40] <Risemiria> she's not shy
[07:40] <Magicrailgunner> what about those epic two hand swords you see Richard Lionheart wield in the tapestries/paintings?
[07:40] <McDerp> It's cute, I like it there c:
[07:40] <Magicrailgunner> probably painting
[07:40] <Risemiria> Now that she's a mod
[07:40] <McDerp> exaggerations
[07:40] <Risemiria> she has no fear of being kicked by Hoss
[07:40] <McDerp> and proselytizing :V
[07:40] <Risemiria> pffft
[07:40] <Kitsuboshi> hoss will find a way
[07:40] <McDerp> there were pictures and tapestries of dudes hacking through people's helmets
[07:40] <Gensui Hime> no he won't
[07:41] <Gensui Hime> unless he somehow acquires higher privs than me
[07:41] <Gensui Hime> which is a bureaucrat
[07:41] <Kitsuboshi> well then
[07:41] <Harunadesu> lol new dd murakumo cfm :&gt;

[07:41] <Risemiria> Thought it was just a mod
[07:41] <McDerp> lel
[07:41] <Gensui Hime> chatmod
[07:41] <Risemiria> yeah
[07:41] <Risemiria> so if he becomes an admin
[07:41] <Risemiria> he can kick it again
[07:41] <Gensui Hime> yes
[07:41] <Gensui Hime> unfortunately
[07:42] <McDerp> anyway that stupid 200€ unit has an ammo counter, chrono and nuke, and I want it for the counter _(:3/ L)_

[11:36] <Blasterion> Clicked retreat
[11:36] <Alexanderex> can we have a vote on a change on the kick text?
[11:36] <Zel-melon> therefore, stymph can be kick
[11:36] <Blasterion> too many 3-2As
[11:36] <Stymphalian> oh god
[11:36] <Blasterion> meant to advance in 2-3
[11:36] <Crazy teitoku> lel ouch Blast
[11:37] <Flonnaru> morning everyone
[11:37] <Zel-melon> evening
[11:37] <Crazy teitoku> If you have a formidable config for 3-2A it doesn't hurt all that much to keep dead ending 3-2 northern route imo.
[11:37] <Alexanderex> evening
[11:37] <Alexanderex> kek
[11:37] <Crazy teitoku> Hi Flonn
[11:37] <Stymphalian> night
[11:37] <Alexanderex> nah cTTK
[11:37] <WanWan101> so laaagh
[11:37] <Alexanderex> easies config for 3-2-A should be cheap too
[11:38] <Zel-melon> it's not really worth it
[11:38] <Crazy teitoku> shrug I love scooping like around 100 steel on the way and bit more xp as well at that :D 
[11:38] <Flonnaru> @zel,something you never gonna see 
http://imgur.com/39Cesbh
[11:38] <Alexanderex> too many Wos in dead end
[11:38] <Crazy teitoku> True.
[11:38] <Alexanderex> ^ that will need subcheesing i guess
[11:38] <Zel-melon> hey flon
[11:38] <Zel-melon> hey hey flon
[11:38] <Flonnaru> : &gt;
[11:38] <Zel-melon> hey hey hey flon
[11:38] <Zel-melon> bye
[11:38] <Alexanderex> subcheesing 3-2A is probably the only way to hit the steel node for cheap
[11:39] <Crazy teitoku> I haven't really bothered subcheesing 3-2 all that much, it was more of just running against my grind fleet.
[11:39] <Zel-melon> brb I smell something burning
[11:39] <Alexanderex> the risk of random chip damage is abit... daunting
[11:39] <Crazy teitoku> Besides, subcheesing with like 4 SS and 1 maruyu is kind of lel.
[11:39] <Alexanderex> even for farming steel
[11:39] <Crazy teitoku> Ah yeah.. not worth it.
[11:40] <Alexanderex> should be fine with subcheesing.. what's your subs level at?
[11:40] <Shadowofsora> maruyu does not kind as sub for you? : D
[11:40] <Crazy teitoku> They are fine, well I guess.
[11:40] <Crazy teitoku> Like around level 60 each.
[11:40] <Alexanderex> should be fine for sub-cheesing 3-2-A I guess
[11:40] <Alexanderex> you might get a chuuha once in a awhile but shouldn't be a problem
[11:41] <Crazy teitoku> @Shadow not my kind of sub :v would have preferred something like hacchan or sea oil
[11:41] <Alexanderex> especially with 4 good subs, you can expect at least 2 opening kills
[11:41] <Crazy teitoku> I just hate that random moment maruyu gets crit.
[11:41] <Alexanderex> Crazy u don't have u-511?
[11:41] <Crazy teitoku> I do Alex.
[11:41] <Alexanderex> put her at fs, then
[11:41] <Alexanderex> oh
[11:41] <Alexanderex> no hacchan
[11:42] <Crazy teitoku> Ro-chan, iku, dechi and imuya plus maruyu.
[11:42] <Alexanderex> she's probably the hardest to drop, i guess
[11:42] <Alexanderex> unless you count world 6's maruyu drop lol
[11:42] <Crazy teitoku> She is for me :| even tried crafting but failed.
[11:42] <Crazy teitoku> eww.
[11:42] <Alexanderex> keep trying, you'll get her
[11:42] <Alexanderex> 4 crafts a day
[11:42] <Shadowofsora> well without event-only subs the only kind of 6-sub team i could get is with maruyu for now i guess though i even fail at getting hacchan and iku for now :v
[11:42] <Alexanderex> yeah
[11:43] <Alexanderex> getting a full sub fleet is one of the many hurdles
[11:43] <Crazy teitoku> Hm I kind of forgot about doing that 4 crafts a day for hacchan. Sort of gave up after looking at my res going down.
[11:43] <Alexanderex> getting A FEW full sub fleets... is easier
[11:43] <Shadowofsora> 2700 exp until lvl 40 i could need some radar's after that for 1-5 -.-
[11:43] <Crazy teitoku> @Shadow did you farm E-1 last event?
[11:44] <Alexanderex> e-1 was sub heaven
[11:44] <Shadowofsora> joined a little bit too late
[11:44] <Crazy teitoku> I still prefer a 'full house' if you know what I mean Alex :&gt;
[11:44] <Alexanderex> i remembered doing 2 days of daily modernization with 5 subs a pop
[11:44] <Crazy teitoku> A full house without maruyu
[11:44] <Shadowofsora> cried cuz i kinda liket i511
[11:44] <Crazy teitoku> @Shadow ah dang.
[11:44] <Alexanderex> i'm working towards it , cTTK 8D
[11:44] <Alexanderex> ubot is at level 84
[11:44] <Alexanderex> i wonder if i can get her to 99... everyone else is waiting
[11:45] <Crazy teitoku> @Alex I kind of forgot about that, I mean my last hacchan attempt with beaver got another beaver.
[11:45] <Flonnaru> im just using yuu as flag and she is level 95 atm
[11:45] <Alexanderex> LOL
[11:45] <Alexanderex> why not try crafting with sub fs?
[11:45] <Shadowofsora> well i do at least two 250 30 200 30 a day and got yesterday another i-168...
[11:46] <Crazy teitoku> lel, yuuchan craze, mine has crossed that hurdle and has now got a tan.
[11:46] <Alexanderex> @Flon I don't get much opportunity to level ubot outside of PvP because of next event
[11:46] <Alexanderex> i can't even do 3-2-A
[11:46] <Flonnaru> next event is maybe in 2-3 months
[11:46] <Alexanderex> yeah
[11:46] <Flonnaru> i doubt its gonna happen next month
[11:46] <Alexanderex> i have to farm up from now
[11:46] <Alexanderex> i mean
[11:46] <Crazy teitoku> @Alex I could try.. I was doing that as like 10 times to see my luck. Some other person here mentioned about getting lots of subs including hacchan with beaver as fs.
[11:46] <Alexanderex> i started last even with 140k fuel and 750 buckets
[11:46] <Alexanderex> i was left bankrupt
[11:47] <Flonnaru> i started with 40k fuel and was fine
[11:47] <Alexanderex> knowing how bad I am at managing resources, i need to farm up
[11:47] <Shadowofsora> sounds interesting maybe i will try it today :3
[11:47] <Crazy teitoku> @Shadow you should like grind 1-5 A B C node imo. I got both my imuya and then later on dechi from there.
[11:47] <Alexanderex> how about maruyu fs
[11:47] <Alexanderex> kek
[11:47] <Crazy teitoku> &gt; maruyu fs
[11:47] <Crazy teitoku> ._.'
[11:47] <Alexanderex> you'd never know
[11:47] <Shadowofsora> 3 imuyas and 2 dechis so far hacchan and iku are needed can't even effective run 2-3 with 2 subs...
[11:48] <Alexanderex> maruyu is that one single ship that stands out amongst kanmusus and abyssals
[11:48] <Crazy teitoku> &lt; imagines getting akeboner with maruyu as fs ;) 
[11:48] <Alexanderex> the "luck factor" that you wished you had, or you wished you never had
[11:48] <Tohoseiryu> Morning!
[11:48] <Tohoseiryu> :3
[11:48] <Alexanderex> go away
[11:48] <Alexanderex> lel kidding

[11:48] <Tohoseiryu> Hoppou why? :c
[11:48] <Flonnaru> morning
[11:48] <Shadowofsora> even farmed a bit the boss node in 1-5 cuz i need the medals anyway
[11:48] <Crazy teitoku> @Shadow I ran 2+1 fleet at 2-3 eventually managed to get through Bw4 with it even though it was a struggle. The +1 there is maruyu.
[11:49] <Crazy teitoku> lel maybe Alex, maybe.
[11:49] <Alexanderex> if next event involves hoppo-bashing again i s2g
[11:49] <Tohoseiryu> No Shoukaku for me :c

[11:51] <Alexanderex> for now, it's just eating grass for the next 2-3 months
[11:51] <Flonnaru> instead of hoarding the resources how about using it for leveling up your ships
[11:51] <Crazy teitoku> I am still trying to get 3-3 unlocked lel. Talking about world 5 there.
[11:51] <Alexanderex> yeah i guess so
[11:52] <Alexanderex> my 3-2-A leveling is permanently cockblocked by isuzus

[11:55] <Hossinator> <span class="me-username">* <span>Hossinator</span></span> wants to talk about hating the new BB even though ill actually be hyped
[11:55] <Alexanderex> honestly i don't know what to ship to level
[11:55] <Crazy teitoku> I probably need to start using (screw) daily to improve that 35.6cm
[11:55] <Alexanderex> i passed e-5 hard but the event was actually lenient to all of us
[11:55] <Flonnaru> why impove 35.6 cm

[11:55] <WanWan101> <span class="me-username">* <span>WanWan101</span></span> have to grind for newly acquired mutsu and kaga
[11:55] <Crazy teitoku> Bleh, supposedly for proto 35.6 or something.
[11:55] <Alexanderex> 46 cms needs 46 cms lol
[11:55] <Alexanderex> 46cm proto uses 41
[11:55] <Flonnaru> thatswhy you craft 46cm 
[11:55] <Alexanderex> kek
[11:55] <Tohoseiryu> Dunkerque-class when 
[11:56] <Crazy teitoku> O.o
[11:56] <Alexanderex> i'm too poor
[11:56] <Crazy teitoku> I have like 5 46cm though.
[11:56] <Alexanderex> barely enough to go around
[11:56] <Crazy teitoku> Meh.

[11:59] <WanWan101> damn maruyu first time returns undamaged from 3-2A
[11:59] <Alexanderex> it's bucket's that i'm worried about
[11:59] <Crazy teitoku> @Alex dw you ain't the only one without biscuit.
[11:59] <Alexanderex> bucket farming = no resource farming
[11:59] <Alexanderex> and vice versa
[11:59] <Crazy teitoku> lelwut.
[11:59] <Hossinator> funny

[12:00] <Crazy teitoku> wut.. I get 4 fleets, get buckets every so often, that plus a few other res.
[12:00] <WanWan101> i got 15 in 15 consecutive runs, thanks to kiyoshimo
[12:00] <Alexanderex> 37 and 38 have sparkles
[12:00] <Alexanderex> do you guys spam 37/38 too?
[12:00] <WanWan101> should give her ring
[12:00] <Tohoseiryu> I need another Akitsu
[12:00] <Crazy teitoku> Not I.
[12:00] <Alexanderex> or the standard 2/5/21
[12:00] <Tohoseiryu> I need more landing craftz
[12:01] <Crazy teitoku> 2/3/9 :x
[12:01] <Alexanderex> hmmphs
[12:01] <Alexanderex> 9?
[12:01] <WanWan101> 37/38? if only i can finish exped 30
[12:01] <Hossinator> pick expeditions based on your needs
[12:01] <Alexanderex> ah, 9
[12:01] <Crazy teitoku> Fuel, I don't have tokyo express unlocked.
[12:01] <Tohoseiryu> Kiso Kai Ni time1111!!!111!!!!!
[12:01] <Hossinator> atm i have a ton of steel, so im running fuel/ammo/baux
[12:01] <Hossinator> since i dont need to worry about steel
[12:01] <Alexanderex> 9 is rewarding only if you have max sparkles, though
[12:01] <Alexanderex> because of the possible 2 buckets
[12:02] <Crazy teitoku> Bleh, too much effort haha.
[12:02] <Alexanderex> if not, doing 5 withough sparkles is even faster if you don't care for exp9's 2 buckets
[12:02] <Crazy teitoku> I only care about fuel.
[12:02] <Tohoseiryu> I'm doing 5/31/37 atm, cuz my fleets at 39
[12:02] <Alexanderex> 5 gives more fuel per hour
[12:02] <Alexanderex> and ammo too
[12:02] <Crazy teitoku> Yeah but I don't want ammo lel.
[12:02] <Alexanderex> that is, of course, u make full use of the hour
[12:02] <Crazy teitoku> &lt; 70k ammo
[12:02] <Alexanderex> don't make sense if you send exp5 and forget about it for half the day
[12:03] <Qu33k> <span class="me-username">* <span>Qu33k</span></span> wanders in, groggy and under caffeinated 
[12:03] <Crazy teitoku> hi qu33k
[12:03] <WanWan101> <span class="me-username">* <span>WanWan101</span></span> licks Qu33k
[12:03] <Hossinator> sounds like you need a kickstarter
[12:03] <Hossinator> qu33k
[12:03] <Alexanderex> <span class="me-username">* <span>Alexanderex</span></span> stabs and inject Qu33k with 140% pure liquid caffeine
[12:03] <Qu33k> O_O
[12:03] <Tohoseiryu> 21/37/38 
[12:03] <Hossinator> you just killed him
[12:03] <Qu33k> <span class="me-username">* <span>Qu33k</span></span> jitters
[12:03] <Tohoseiryu> Good?
[12:03] <Alexanderex> @toho sounds good i guess
[12:04] <Qu33k> ssahright
[12:04] <Crazy teitoku> I was previously running on exp 5 but yeah I noticed that my ammo keeps going up like hell, that with exp 2 and 3. So I dropped it out and trying to level other res.
[12:04] <Alexanderex> 21 is abit better than 5 if you don't care for the nomial amount of steel and baux
[12:04] <Alexanderex> that, and the random GS is very helpful
[12:04] <Tohoseiryu> Any better combo?
[12:04] <Alexanderex> i think this one's good for now
[12:04] <Hossinator> expedition on your needs
[12:04] <Hossinator> thats it
[12:04] <Hossinator> theres no god combo
[12:04] <Alexanderex> 37/38 covers steel, ammo and baux
[12:04] <Qu33k> 2/21/37-8 here
[12:05] <Qu33k> with 11 sparkled for overnight/work
[12:05] <Alexanderex> 2/37/38 because echo recommended it
[12:05] <Crazy teitoku> Some guy here said the other day that using buckets on exp 6 gets buckets supposedly.
[12:05] <YasenSuki> 2/4/38
[12:05] <Crazy teitoku> Arkay, that's the handle.
[12:05] <Alexanderex> &gt; using buckets on exp 6
[12:05] <Alexanderex> w0t
[12:05] <Alexanderex> how
[12:05] <Crazy teitoku> Er I meant using drums to get buckets
[12:05] <Crazy teitoku> lel typo.
[12:05] <Alexanderex> LOL
[12:06] <Alexanderex> my brain nearly cannot compute
[12:06] <Alexanderex> ahh it's all RNG i guess
[12:06] <Crazy teitoku> <span class="me-username">* <span>Crazy teitoku</span></span> blames on qu33k for making him tired.
[12:06] <Crazy teitoku> lel XD
[12:06] <Alexanderex> unless that guy tried maximum drums with 150 sorties to exp6
[12:06] <Crazy teitoku> no idea really.
[12:06] <Alexanderex> hmmphs
[12:06] <Alexanderex> I guess they won;t implement too much goodies using drums
[12:07] <ArcticaFrost> Qu33333333333k

[12:14] <ArcticaFrost> DJ IN THE HOUSE!
[12:14] <WanWan101> ;3
[12:14] <Qu33k> Blaster, what CA did you Kai Ni?
[12:14] <Qu33k> Toho, I would love to see Nisshin in-game
[12:14] <Qu33k> just to see what the devs do with her
[12:15] <Tohoseiryu> I want her cuz I want to marry a seaplane tender
[12:15] <Qu33k> she was a very important ship in the Solomons
[12:15] <Qu33k> fast enough for Tokyo Express
[12:15] <Qu33k> and big enough to carry large equipment
[12:16] <Qu33k> like tanks and artillery
[12:16] <Alexanderex> ^
[12:16] <Qu33k> that the DDs could not
[12:16] <Alexanderex> inb4 special effect is to refuel and resupply in the middle of a sortie
[12:16] <Qu33k> built in res bonus on expeditions?
[12:16] <Alexanderex> &gt; refuel right before boss battle
&gt; kek
[12:16] <Flonnaru> that would mean there might be more then 4 battle nodes
[12:17] <Alexanderex> gg
[12:17] <Alexanderex> i actually don't want that LOL
[12:17] <Alexanderex> ah well
[12:17] <Qu33k> counts as equipped with drums without using slots?
[12:17] <Alexanderex> ok it's 8, time to pack up from workplace
[12:17] <Tohoseiryu> Isn't the next event Solomons? 
[12:17] <Crazy teitoku> Devs won't happily gives us any of those until we get all salty first.
[12:17] <Tohoseiryu> ...
[12:17] <Qu33k> no idea what next Event is
[12:17] <Alexanderex> e-5 hard mode boss DROP
[12:17] <Alexanderex> gg good game
[12:17] <Qu33k> no info has been released, other than that there will be one
[12:17] <Crazy teitoku> E-6 boss mode after fleet locks.
[12:17] <WanWan101> ggwp
[12:17] <Raozaqwe> next patch have new kai ni for dd ?
[12:17] <Tohoseiryu> I'd still get it first run and you know it'
[12:17] <Qu33k> and mention of a non-German BB
[12:18] <Alexanderex> &gt; after ship locks
[12:18] <ArcticaFrost> Take a look on recent update.
[12:18] <ArcticaFrost> There is a reason for it.
[12:18] <Someguyjumping> didnt it just say foreign? so not necessarily non-german?
[12:18] <Tohoseiryu> &gt; DDs only
[12:18] <Alexanderex> w0t
[12:18] <Alexanderex> DDs only with ship locks
[12:18] <Alexanderex> time to get a second poi
[12:18] <Tohoseiryu> BB Hime 
[12:18] <Crazy teitoku> It was apart from German supposedly.
[12:18] <Tohoseiryu> All 6 ships
[12:18] <Qu33k> what's gonna be funny is the moans from the Arghos of the world, when they see the AA rating of an Italian BB
[12:18] <Alexanderex> BB hime isn't that bad
[12:18] <Alexanderex> installation is worse
[12:19] <Alexanderex> because no torps
[12:19] <Qu33k> they were horribly undergunned for the job
[12:19] <Raozaqwe> is italy axis ?
[12:19] <Alexanderex> yes
[12:19] <Crazy teitoku> use those rockets from yuu lel.
[12:19] <Tohoseiryu> Combined fleet
[12:19] <Crazy teitoku> yes.
[12:19] <Alexanderex> only 2 lel 
[12:19] <Alexanderex> 6 torps to a BB &gt; 2 rockets to installation
[12:19] <Someguyjumping> i keep forgetting, whats the double attack setup for DD again?
[12:19] <Alexanderex> 2 guns no extra weapon
[12:19] <Crazy teitoku> Well, one rocket is better than none :&gt;
[12:19] <Alexanderex> and by weapon i mean gun or torp
[12:19] <ArcticaFrost> I hope it's going to be a cheap BB in drift
[12:19] <Qu33k> a USN DD had more AA barrels than some of the Italian BBs
[12:20] <Alexanderex> lol
[12:20] <Tohoseiryu> blood for the blood god
[12:20] <Someguyjumping> so just 2 10cm high angle?
[12:20] <Flonnaru> [[Combat#Day Battle Special Attacks .28Artillery Spotting.29]]
[12:20] <Alexanderex> salt for the salt god
[12:20] <ArcticaFrost> Hey
[12:20] <ArcticaFrost> HEY
[12:20] <Alexanderex> + 1 non-weapon
[12:20] <ArcticaFrost> GUYS
[12:20] <ArcticaFrost> There is a wiki
[12:20] <Someguyjumping> sweet thanks
[12:20] <Alexanderex> radar works fine
[12:20] <ArcticaFrost> For that solo reason to check around.
[12:20] <Tohoseiryu> So?
[12:20] <Alexanderex> lel
[12:20] <Alexanderex> ...
[12:20] <Someguyjumping> the wiki and the forum seem to have some conflicting info
[12:20] <Tohoseiryu> This is a chat for said wiki
[12:20] <Someguyjumping> so i figure i double check
[12:20] <Alexanderex> read the wiki only, it's more informative
[12:21] <ArcticaFrost> Probably me that is getting cynical.
[12:21] <Raozaqwe> ya
[12:21] <Alexanderex> forums is more of speculations and data-testing
[12:21] <Tohoseiryu> It is
[12:21] <Alexanderex> that's where all the "testing" goes to
[12:21] <ArcticaFrost> There is a fine like to ask simple question and advance question.
[12:21] <Qu33k> Blood for the Blood Goat!
[12:21] <Alexanderex> go to wiki for more refined and established info
[12:21] <EchoHolic> We should auto kick anyone with a default avatar
[12:21] <Someguyjumping> wow, a warhammer reference
[12:21] <Raozaqwe> all the data is from player's test right ?
[12:21] <Someguyjumping> havnt seen those in a while
[12:21] <Raozaqwe> or the dev ?
[12:21] <EchoHolic> But that's just me being mean
[12:21] <Alexanderex> a mix
[12:22] <Someguyjumping> ...., ill go change avatar then
[12:22] <Hossinator> Andrea Doria
[12:22] <ArcticaFrost> The info is normally reliable.
[12:22] <YasenSuki> :p 
[12:22] <Hossinator> thats the BB
[12:22] <Hossinator> we might get
[12:22] <Alexanderex> alright, home is calling, my computer waifu wants me
[12:22] <Tohoseiryu> tbf most wiki comments now are new ttks worshiping ONLy the German navy and saying who "x ship could beat y Japanese counterpart" 
[12:22] <EchoHolic> To me, it feels like people who have a blank avatar are people who just created an account to ask chat instead of searching the wiki
[12:22] <ArcticaFrost> Really? I think most comments is about how awesome german ships look.
[12:22] <EchoHolic> No offense if that isn't the case
[12:22] <ArcticaFrost> And not about vs this and that.
[12:22] <Raozaqwe> aww :( 
[12:23] <Tohoseiryu> I've seen some shitty ones
[12:23] <Crazy teitoku> @Alex cya
[12:23] <Qu33k> The Germans had some good ships
[12:23] <Qu33k> but so did Japan
[12:23] <Tohoseiryu> Maybe that was the Youtube comments 
[12:23] <EchoHolic> But really we're happy to help to clarify info, not explain from the ground up
[12:23] <Qu33k> would depend on the class
[12:23] <Qu33k> DDs would be all IJN
[12:23] <Qu33k> heavy cruisers would be an interesting match-up
[12:23] <Tohoseiryu> DDs would be USN
[12:24] <Tohoseiryu> rrek'd
[12:24] <Qu33k> Bis would eat any of the IJN older BBs, but lose horribly to Yamato
[12:24] <ArcticaFrost> In that case, everything would be USN
[12:24] <Raozaqwe> they're not gonna add us ship
[12:24] <Crazy teitoku> They will, as an abyss fleet.
[12:24] <Tohoseiryu> [FREEDOM INTENSIFIES]
[12:24] <Crazy teitoku> ship even.
[12:24] <Raozaqwe> right
[12:24] <Tohoseiryu> There is already one US ship
[12:24] <Qu33k> <span class="me-username">* <span>Qu33k</span></span> watches someguyfalling
[12:24] <Tohoseiryu> Prinz 
[12:25] <Raozaqwe> ?
[12:25] <Someguyjumping> still here
[12:25] <Crazy teitoku> Prinz is German.
[12:25] <Someguyjumping> for now
[12:25] <Qu33k> Toho, that's actually correct, 
[12:25] <Crazy teitoku> wut..
[12:25] <Qu33k> she was given a USN # briefly before the atomic tests
[12:25] <Tohoseiryu> At the end of the war, Prinz was commissioned by the USN as a miscellaneous vessel 
[12:25] <WanWan101> ^
[12:25] <Crazy teitoku> So was Nagato?
[12:25] <Tohoseiryu> Nope
[12:25] <Qu33k> so the Soviets didn't know about us having her
[12:26] <Qu33k> basically
[12:26] <Raozaqwe> Abyssal is kinda like a mix of sunken ijn ship and us ship.
[12:26] <ArcticaFrost> Mixed of everything
[12:26] <Someguyjumping> and since im from aus, i gotta mention ABDA
[12:26] <Qu33k> yup!
[12:26] <Kurokami Ryu> Hey guys.
[12:26] <ArcticaFrost> Don't forget RN
[12:26] <Qu33k> that Event wasn't hidden at all
[12:26] <Qu33k> o7 Houston and Perth
[12:27] <Crazy teitoku> Yeah but just because Prinz was US ship, she still isn't a proper US ship. It is kind of like Kongou being built in England or whatever but remains as IJN ship.
[12:27] <Crazy teitoku> @Ryu hi
[12:27] <Qu33k> CrayTTK, quit muddying the waters with facts
[12:27] <Qu33k> this is chat, after all
[12:27] <Qu33k> :-p 
[12:27] <WanWan101> lol
[12:27] <Crazy teitoku> Eh, someone was pointing out facts before then :p 
[12:27] <Tohoseiryu> Kongou was never commissioned by the RN tho. 
[12:28] <Raozaqwe> whats Rn ?
[12:28] <Hossinator> hey
[12:28] <Tohoseiryu> She was always intended to be an IJN ship
[12:28] <Crazy teitoku> Royal Navy
[12:28] <Hossinator> its a caboose
[12:28] <Hossinator> hi caboose
[12:28] <WanWan101> hi caboose o/
[12:28] <Crazy teitoku> Yes, even though she was built in England.
[12:28] <Tohoseiryu> Prinz became the USS Prinz Eugune
[12:29] <Qu33k> also, obligatory 
[12:29] <ArcticaFrost> Hey guys, ships is build my humans :O
[12:29] <ArcticaFrost> HUMAN NATION OP

[04:15] <D Des> what about 4 BWS and 2 BB hime on first node
[04:15] <Nothis> ( screw double line node )
[04:15] <Kotohood> 12 vs 12 is not fair with the kind of HP and Attack power they ahce
[04:16] <Nothis> asleast their accuracy is now shit like us
[04:16] <Sshinka> boss node only if they do that
[04:16] <CreamX> boss node with 5 bb hime
[04:16] <Kurokami Ryu> Who said abyssals play fair?
[04:16] <Sshinka> but highly unlikely
[04:16] <YasenSuki> 5-3 low chance to E node
(screw) you RNG
[04:16] <Xenzul> CANCER
[04:17] <Veeliam> http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=42097009
[04:17] <Sshinka> well, we get uber yasen abilities compared to Abyssals - that's also not fair :P 
[04:17] <YasenSuki> :p 
[04:17] <Kotohood> Abbysals Yasen abilities are more Uber if you ask me lol
[04:17] <Nothis> :P need laser cannon for us
[04:18] <D Des> laser fleets and regenrating hp boss?
[04:18] <Sshinka> not really koto, with yasen equipement you wreck them on regular bases
[04:18] <Veeliam> Fog fleet
[04:18] <D Des> no way NOO WAAAAY
[04:18] <YasenSuki> urgh regen
[04:18] <CreamX> regen + laser :&gt;
[04:18] <Nothis> we will get plot armor than
[04:18] <Kotohood> Depends on their ship, like their symbiotic hime has like 120 luck or something
[04:18] <Kotohood> they CV can attack at night
[04:19] <D Des> how about fubuki will never sink
[04:19] <Nothis> if only our CV can attack at night
[04:19] <Sshinka> but that is all historically ok... IJN did well in yasen in vast majority of NBs
[04:19] <Kurokami Ryu> inb4 we have a dev in chat and he likes your ideas....
[04:19] <YasenSuki> ....
[04:19] <D Des> don't worry dev don;t understand english
[04:19] <Kurokami Ryu> lol
[04:19] <D Des> (YEA SUUUREEEE)
[04:19] <Nothis> you sure ?
[04:19] <CreamX> lel
[04:19] <Kotohood> IJN win some they lose some lol
[04:19] <Kyzella> Engrish!
[04:19] <Nothis> i dbouy about it :&lt;
[04:19] <Nothis> doubt*
[04:20] <D Des> inb4 wiki admin is dev in disguise
[04:20] <Nothis> inb4 someone here is in disguise
[04:20] <EchoHolic> Really the "Watch out, devs might hear you" joke doesn't work for Kancolle
[04:20] <EchoHolic> The devs will never hear you
[04:20] <Sshinka> koto in NB they lost maybe only one or two battles...
[04:20] <D Des> more like = watch out admin might troll you
[04:21] <Kurokami Ryu> All devs speak english because programming IS english
[04:21] <Kurokami Ryu> lulz
[04:21] <Qu33k> The IJN trained relentlessly pre-war for night battle
[04:21] <Sshinka> yep
[04:21] <Sshinka> and it payed off
[04:21] <Qu33k> it was their way of taking on the superior numbers of the USN
[04:21] <Qu33k> and it payed off ^
[04:21] <Zel-melon> fuck...anime thread failed in loading...need to type again
[04:21] <Intelman> Every soldier was required to be able to see in the dark with no light source
[04:21] <EchoHolic> What was the next episode even
[04:22] <Nothis> i need abyssal radar
[04:22] <EchoHolic> I was so upset with the last episode I didn't pay attention
[04:22] <Zel-melon> MI
[04:22] <Zel-melon> which proably won't be about MI
[04:22] <Sshinka> Intel *Sailor
[04:22] <Sshinka> :) 
[04:22] <EchoHolic> Damn it's gonna be disappointing
[04:22] <D Des> dunno I never watch kancolle anime anymore
[04:22] <Zel-melon> I don't even care anymore...
[04:22] <Sshinka> sailor / soldier = different
[04:22] <D Des> ever since B**CH episode.....
[04:22] <Kotohood> well, doesn't change the fact that they have quite the Yasen if done properly in game lol
[04:22] <CreamX> MI with armor plot
[04:22] <CreamX> no one will sink
[04:22] <Zel-melon> I only know what each episode is about because I make the new thread every week
[04:23] <Qu33k> Fubuki K2 has AA CI equip
[04:23] <Zel-melon> I started complaining ever since the Des6 episode
[04:23] <Veeliam> the writer is someone who did Idolmaster Xeno'macross-ripoff'glossia :v
[04:23] <Qu33k> think about it
[04:23] <Nothis> i started complaining right after half of ep 1
[04:23] <Sshinka> Fubuki is good girl for your basic AACI needs
[04:23] <Kotohood> Kancolle = 6/10 for me
[04:23] <Intelman> I was okay with the show
[04:23] <Zel-melon> the director did Nanoha striker which is why I was having some hope
[04:23] <Intelman> until episode 3
[04:23] <Kotohood> slightly above average
[04:23] <Sshinka> i had only her at winter event and she helped alot
[04:24] <D Des> nah koto
[04:24] <Veeliam> Fubuki is Anastasia in Idolmaster Cinderella kek
[04:24] <Nothis> if only peoples planned the anime plot better
[04:24] <Intelman> If I had to score episode 3 it would be like 0.5/10
[04:24] <EchoHolic> The problem with the writing I realized is that the script writer obviously doesn't play Kancolle
[04:24] <D Des> if only there's MORE gun and dogfight....
[04:24] <Nothis> ikr echo ?
[04:24] <D Des> not just that echo
[04:24] <Veeliam> episode 3 of kancolle animu is like half-life 3 canceled/10
[04:24] <Nothis> i still prefer most doujins instead of the anime
[04:24] <CreamX> they just randomly add stuff . . 
[04:24] <EchoHolic> It's all written based off online research and knowledge about WWII
[04:24] <D Des> the writer seems not interested in gunfight and actions too
[04:25] <EchoHolic> The only 2 good episodes were the first two episode
[04:25] <Veeliam> dressing up as ships = / = WWII
[04:25] <EchoHolic> *s
[04:25] <D Des> should have slapped nanoha writer
[04:25] <D Des> then things might be more interesting
[04:25] <Nothis> seriously wanna slap the writters with repair bucket
[04:25] <Nothis> fix our anime plot ffs
[04:25] <Kotohood> The Anime lacked something from the game, probably fighting against ghost of the past part
[04:25] <D Des> put tonda macho admiral as protag
[04:25] <Veeliam> make it slice of life and don't follow shizz of WWII
[04:26] <Nothis> if they gonna go full slice of life go with how ganbarimasu is
[04:26] <Nothis> better than anime 100/10
[04:26] <CreamX> macho ttk or shiba inu
[04:26] <EchoHolic> Whenever they stop doing slice-of-life which is easy to write, they fall back on copying history which sucks
[04:26] <Zel-melon> Ep 3 is just like a Madoka Ep3 factor wannabe
[04:26] <Kotohood> Ganbarimasu is what I expected the Anime to be lol
[04:26] <Kyzella> https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1956534
[04:26] <D Des> shiba inu is kinda overboard.....
[04:26] <Kurokami Ryu> M ttk for anime lol
[04:26] <EchoHolic> This is why the anime is bad
[04:26] <Nothis> true
[04:26] <CreamX> :&gt;
[04:26] <Veeliam> the abyssals stay alive and havin' party
[04:26] <Zel-melon> then ep 4 to 10 they're lost as fuck
[04:26] <Segar> <span class="me-username">* <span>Segar</span></span> slowly walks back it
[04:26] <Intelman> Personal enjoyment of each episode : 7/10 , 7/10, 0.5/10, 5/10, 4/10, 9/10, 5/10, 8/10, 4/10, 5/10
[04:26] <Segar> in*
[04:26] <CreamX> episode 3 still a shit. . 
[04:26] <Nothis> i was hoping for ganbarimasu kind of plot
[04:27] <D Des> heck even many doujins are better.......
[04:27] <Nothis> turn out it way shitter than i though
[04:27] <Zel-melon> ep 3 is a fail attempt to increase the suspense of the anime
[04:27] <Veeliam> Kisaragi is still an OK in my book eventho the lewdist quote
[04:27] <CreamX> episode 1 was best ep so far lel (except for that 1 hit hime)
[04:27] <D Des> after eps 3
[04:27] <Kotohood> I can list like 20 doujins that are better than the anime lol
[04:27] <D Des> I was expecting MORE ACTIONS
[04:27] <Zel-melon> ofc ep 1 is the best because we don't know what to expect yet
[04:27] <D Des> like in madoki
[04:27] <Intelman> I thought they're going to corner Kisaragi or something
[04:27] <Intelman> but no, an airplane out of nowhere
[04:27] <D Des> at least more than half of time its FULL BLASTED ACTIONS!!
[04:27] <Intelman> wow
[04:27] <Intelman> It's like
[04:28] <Veeliam> Ship of the North Star
[04:28] <Intelman> something that I thuoght would be cool when I was 7
[04:28] <CreamX> cg was nc but the plot pfft
[04:28] <D Des> well after eps 6
[04:28] <Nothis> i said fan works is 100% better than anime
[04:28] <Keenteu> time for 80 hours with no 3rd fleet
[04:28] <D Des> or somewhere around that number
[04:28] <Intelman> Actually I need more like episode 6 and 8
[04:29] <D Des> I feel like kancolle anime is written by the guy who writes for infinite stratos.....
[04:29] <Sshinka> at 1st episode i thought they gonna sink them 1 by 1 in chronological order like WW2.. i stopped watching at EP3
[04:29] <D Des> then suddenly on 12th eps everyone sunk
[04:29] <CreamX> lel
[04:29] <Kyzella> Nagato lives*
[04:29] <Kyzella> To see a huuuge bang
[04:29] <Sshinka> not for long :P 
[04:29] <CreamX> ttk drop nuclear
[04:30] <D Des> lol final eps = NUKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[04:30] <CreamX> and everyone dies
[04:30] <Intelman> It's directed by someone who directed Genei Wo Kakeru Taiyou
[04:30] <Intelman> if anybody wathces that lol
[04:30] <D Des> directed by michael bay
[04:30] <Sshinka> lol
[04:30] <D Des> EXLOSION ENDING
[04:30] <Nothis> i bet he never play KC -.-
[04:30] <CreamX> genei was nice tho
[04:30] <D Des> *EXPLOSION
[04:30] <Intelman> Genei was... well... 6/10
[04:31] <Intelman> I just hope this thing isn't secretly written by the guy who was responsible for Mahou Sensou
[04:31] <Sshinka> crap... Iku in orange from 1 hit in Orel .. meh
[04:31] <CreamX> if they make that anime into pvp type then all is well
[04:31] <Veeliam> 12th Episode of kancolle be like LoGH
[04:31] <Kurokami Ryu> Genai was that bad. Just everbody comparing it with Madoka.
[04:31] <Kurokami Ryu> *wasn't
[04:31] <Intelman> Genei wasn't that good either imo
[04:32] <Intelman> but certainly wins my personal no.1 OP of 2013
[04:32] <Intelman> Traumerei
[04:32] <CreamX> traumerei was good as fk
[04:32] <Shadowofsora> genei was funny :3
[04:32] <D Des> I dare to bet final boss was BB hime
[04:32] <D Des> *is
[04:32] <Intelman> like Mahou Sensou, the show was shit, but the ED took my no.1 fav list
[04:32] <CreamX> nah . . its gonna be BWS
[04:33] <D Des> BWS on preboss
[04:33] <Veeliam> BB Hime pls
[04:33] <CreamX> mahou sensou was a bs
[04:33] <Nothis> nah it gonna be midway :&gt;
[04:33] <Veeliam> Anchorage Oni
[04:33] <Intelman> but...
[04:33] <Nothis> RIP everyone
[04:33] <Intelman> couldn't decide which one's the worst in 2014
[04:33] <CreamX> they only waste their money to produce that anime
[04:33] <Intelman> Mahou Sensou or Glasslip
[04:33] <D Des> nah cream
[04:34] <D Des> they waste their money on hiring the wrong writer.....
[04:34] <Nothis> devs wasted money for the anime which basically make it very hard for all TTKs
[04:34] <Nothis> to like it
[04:34] <D Des> should have picked some people from doujin fanbase
[04:34] <D Des> to write it
[04:34] <Intelman> I knew it
[04:34] <Kurokami Ryu> I think most kancolle players could have written a better script. lol
[04:34] <Intelman> when they delayed the show
[04:35] <Intelman> I was like
[04:35] <Intelman> oh shit..
[04:35] <Shadowofsora> is the kc anime that bad?
[04:35] <Nothis> yes
[04:35] <CreamX> if they made gen as the writter then it will be a decent anime imo
[04:35] <D Des> sora
[04:35] <D Des> its not bad IF you don't play the game
[04:35] <Intelman> It's disappointing so far
[04:35] <Veeliam> Idolmaster Xenoglossia is the one wrote all that shit for ship girl animu
[04:35] <Nothis> better fired the writter before season 2
[04:35] <D Des> wait what?
[04:35] <Nothis> and hire some real KC veterans as writter
[04:35] <D Des> it was written by idolmaster anime writer?
[04:36] <CreamX> or player
[04:36] <Shadowofsora> then naka must be one of the mc's :3
[04:36] <Veeliam> not to mention Xenoglossia is shitty rip-off of Macross
[04:36] <D Des> I'm about to say 
[04:36] <Keenteu> why do we don't see any mordernisation in the anime
[04:36] <Harunadesu> so i think i just repaired ships that were just repaired to full by akashi
[04:36] <Keenteu> nor scrapping
[04:36] <D Des> then WHY NAKA got no screeeen tiiimeeee
[04:36] <CreamX> they should hire that plays a game or knowledgeable about it
[04:36] <Nothis> the only modernization for the anime is writter
[04:36] <Shadowofsora> would be gore --- would be more fund then i guess?

[04:36] <Shadowofsora> *fun
[04:37] <Intelman> hah, they couldn't even get the Kai Ni right
[04:37] <Nothis> true
[04:37] <Veeliam> want gore, ask Araki or Tetsuo Hara. lel
[04:37] <D Des> put the writer of saint seiya
[04:37] <D Des> then I will watch it everyday 3 times
[04:37] <Intelman> the least thing they got right is the bucket
[04:37] <Intelman> the rest are subtle
[04:37] <CreamX> the one who write mirai nikki 
[04:37] <Intelman> so subtle it's arguable
[04:37] <Veeliam> director of souten no ken pls
[04:38] <Shadowofsora> nah the writer of higurashi pls :3
[04:38] <D Des> kancolle anime need more bullets
[04:38] <D Des> more girls crying in despair
[04:38] <Veeliam> MD Geist then
[04:38] <Nothis> anyone is good if only they are better than the current one
[04:38] <D Des> to show the pain of kancolle actual game
[04:38] <CreamX> needs gore . . they should make screen time on how to scrap ship girls
[04:38] <Keenteu> yes
[04:38] <Keenteu> at least this
[04:39] <Veeliam> Terra Formars level of gore in 
[04:39] <Kurokami Ryu> gosh... guys....
[04:39] <D Des> on how gamer TTK having hell everytime they sortie on event
[04:39] <Veeliam> Johj Colle
[04:39] <Nothis> how real Kancolle should be: event, full of salt, girls crying in despair, ttk hell and rng troll
[04:39] <Shadowofsora> they need to add san-points like in hayore
[04:39] <Veeliam> Cockroach man dismantles le shippu
[04:39] <CreamX> or atleast they lose some body parts after doin sorties
[04:40] <Nothis> nah too much gore
[04:40] <Shadowofsora> and if they reach 0 the amount of ships drops fast and at the same time they need double's and triples of the same ships : D
[04:40] <Nothis> clothes only :&gt;
[04:40] <WanWan101> lose body parts = freezing
[04:40] <D Des> btw tomorrow is eps 11th right?
[04:40] <WanWan101> =3=)
[04:40] <CreamX> then goin to use repair bucket lel
[04:40] <Shadowofsora> loosing body parts in freezing is just a scratch
[04:40] <CreamX> back to normal
[04:40] <Intelman> day after tomorrow for me
[04:40] <Nothis> please i find the losing body parts thing is very disturbing
[04:41] <WanWan101> ^
[04:41] <Shadowofsora> then you will dislike many funny anime : D
[04:41] <Nothis> so clothes only is still the best
[04:41] <Keenteu> it's lewd
[04:41] <Nothis> i got no good taste in anime
[04:41] <Nothis> so yeah :c
[04:41] <CreamX> who cares . . lel ttk will goin to use repair bucket
[04:41] <CreamX> :&gt;
[04:42] <Qu33k> "we don't want anime with good taste, we want anime that tastes good!"
[04:42] <Shadowofsora> nothing is bad about ecchi-anime and everybody has his own taste but GORE :3
[04:42] <Qu33k> thus Yuri Kuma Arashi is explained
[04:42] <Kurokami Ryu> Guys...
Girls getting hurt = bad
Girls losing clothes = good
As easy as that. :P 
[04:42] <D Des> put ZUN to write the anime lelelel
[04:42] <Intelman> I haven't continued Yuri Kuma since EP... 4
[04:42] <Keenteu> i want to see ttk farming ships for remodel before scrapping them after stealing her equipment
[04:42] <Qu33k> tentacles optional. . .

[04:42] <CreamX> gdi tentacles
[04:42] <Shadowofsora> well a lot of doujinshi showing that both together works good Kurokami

Pls halp post your 2 cents
[05:07] <CreamX> that bombshell
[05:07] <EchoHolic> Even short answers is nice kthxbai
[05:08] <McDerp> for one, no inside jokes
[05:08] <Sylcion> but derp im so deep c:&lt;
[05:08] <Veeliam> Maya K2 = the mochi is a lie
[05:08] <McDerp> oh :V
[05:08] <Nothis> i like trivia
[05:08] <EchoHolic> Post that in suggestions!
[05:08] <McDerp> on it
[05:08] <Nothis> it just peoples being dick at adding something stupid
[05:08] <McDerp> just checking my facts first
[05:09] <EchoHolic> Yeah, I like trivia too
[05:09] <EchoHolic> But since we don't have a moderating standard it's up to each individual person to judge whats right and whats wrong
[05:09] <McDerp> fandom based trivia is fun too, such as RJ's flat is worth noting, but I feel that it belongs in the FAQ Trivia section
[05:09] <EchoHolic> So we gathering opinions in the suggestions page of what each person thinks we should put in it
[05:10] <Kyzella> Responded
[05:10] <D Des> jokes trivia is good
[05:10] <Veeliam> Taihou is a surfing board unless yuo like to tap booteh
[05:10] <D Des> but srs business trivia is a no no
[05:10] <D Des> since its a killjoy
[05:10] <Zel-melon> what in the world is a business trivia?
[05:10] <Caboose10032> Ddes i hope you're trolling
[05:10] <Veeliam> killdeer birds
[05:10] <EchoHolic> etc, some people think it should be informative, some people want memes to be kept out, some people think it should be about things based of the in-game ships, etcetc
[05:10] <Veeliam> yamyams, ew
[05:10] <D Des> lets just say something like historian A debates with another historian
[05:11] <D Des> a debate that will yields nothing......
[05:12] <Sylcion> that reminds me of skyrim
[05:12] <McDerp> posted
[05:12] <WanWan101> ooooh a hieeeei
[05:12] <Caboose10032> Trivia is not for discussion anyway, what is your point?
[05:12] <Nothis> it not trivia fault 
[05:12] <D Des> trivia can lead to heavy discussion in some cases
[05:12] <Nothis> it just peoples fault
[05:12] <McDerp> Trivia did nothing wrong!
[05:12] <Nothis> ^
[05:13] <Caboose10032> Its fine if it actually were discussions, it's just pointless edit wars
[05:13] <McDerp> ^
[05:13] <D Des> aka chances it will stir out more trouble
[05:13] <Nothis> aka we should block all anon edit
[05:13] <D Des> though maybe more reason for admin to have "fun"
[05:13] <Nothis> and recommend anon to register account
[05:13] <McDerp> please have some love for our admins
[05:13] <Nothis> it only takes 5~10 mins to make a wikia account even if you lazy
[05:13] <McDerp> they are tired of all this nonsense and shit
[05:14] <D Des> when there's face there's opinion
[05:14] <EchoHolic> lol nothis why did you add an oppose template
[05:14] <Nothis> lulz
[05:14] <Nothis> fail
[05:14] <D Des> *fact
[05:14] <D Des> not face
[05:14] <EchoHolic> The question is open ended, so approve and oppose templates don't work
[05:14] <D Des> and when there's opinion there'll be multiple editing war
[05:15] <Dechidechi> two justices, who will win/
[05:15] <D Des> whoever win admin lost
[05:15] <McDerp> unless they pull out the BANHAMMER

[05:15] <McDerp> <span class="me-username">* <span>McDerp</span></span> huddles in a corner
[05:15] <D Des> nah unless you disable comment and editing in trivia 
[05:15] <Veeliam> K, starve until yuo skinny
[05:16] <Veeliam> lel
[05:16] <McDerp> or just disable editing and let them set the comments on fire
[05:16] <D Des> to make things peaceful
[05:16] <McDerp> then call an admin in when they've reached a peaceful conclusion
[05:16] <Veeliam> drink more diet coke
[05:16] <D Des> they can save all their opinion whether its right or wrong to themselves
[05:16] <McDerp> ^
[05:16] <D Des> after all it'll resulted in nothing but rage over nothing
[05:16] <Veeliam> bitter herb soup, for the fats burn
[05:16] <McDerp> welp, wutebr
[05:17] <McDerp> cucumbers are great to burn fat, Vee
[05:17] <Dechidechi> well in the form of conveying information as trivia, one needs to apply the neutral standpoint and give the statistics when giving a trivia 
[05:17] <McDerp> <span class="me-username">* <span>McDerp</span></span> licks Dechi
[05:18] <Nothis> i still prefer total anon block from edit

[05:18] <McDerp> <span class="me-username">* <span>McDerp</span></span> calls the MP
[05:18] <McDerp> <span class="me-username">* <span>McDerp</span></span> gets arrested instead
[05:18] <D Des> disable editing and comments
[05:18] <Nothis> nah not comments
[05:18] <Nothis> it fine for anon to comments
[05:18] <Kurokami Ryu> Guys I'd like to remind you that this is a WIKI.
I don't think memes should be placed in the trivia area....
[05:18] <Nothis> but seriously not edit
[05:19] <Dechidechi> memes go on a separate page, like how pixiv does it
[05:19] <D Des> I don't want to visit know your meme site just to know why RJ flatness is a must kuro
[05:19] <Nothis> small but infomative trvia should go to their respective ship girl page
[05:19] <Nothis> meme go to glossary or whatever

[05:42] <Nothis> more kai ni ship ?
[05:42] <McDerp> if those guides could be kept generic and informative, sure
[05:42] <Sshinka> Ninth : not bad idea. it would help new TTKs
[05:42] <Dechidechi> we can add a "I need a coach. Coach me prease" section 
[05:42] <McDerp> but some of pros post their own intricate strategies and another disagrees that turns them into a keg of boom
[05:42] <Sylcion> lol
[05:42] <Nothis> it always on 3 goal basic
[05:43] <Dechidechi> and someone signs up to be that individuals PM coach for 3 days
[05:43] <Nothis> Kai ni ship, rsc and bucket

[05:43] <McDerp> ^
[05:44] <McDerp> just keep the guides simple and neat
[05:44] <Nothis> we got the entire wiki with useful infomation
[05:44] <Nothis> no one read
[05:44] <McDerp> too much information makes people easily give up reading
[05:44] <Sylcion> caboose did we ever even have a proper battleships thats not from 1900-1910 ?!
[05:44] <Nothis> nah it just they being lazy
[05:44] <Dechidechi> so for the dumb who doesn't want to read, they can try the coach section and someone can volunteer to be some newbie's mastaaa
[05:44] <McDerp> 9th had a nice page, albeit a little outdated about it
[05:44] <Tohoseiryu> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrodyne_QH-50_DASH
[05:44] <Qu33k> insert random pr0n in the articles
[05:44] <McDerp> I liked how he supplemented the recommended gears to get-section with pictures

[05:48] <Tohoseiryu> &gt; Priorities in order
[05:48] <Sshinka> do we have autoearase for comments older than 12 months, or something like that? think the most weight in wiki is in the comments
[05:48] <Nothis> i don't think comments will affect anything
[05:49] <Qu33k> harumph
[05:49] <Qu33k> Maya is still banged up from the 6-2 run
[05:49] <Kurokami Ryu> No Sshinka we don't.

[05:50] <Qu33k> guess it's my back-up AA CI ship then
[05:50] <Qu33k> Taigei!!!!!
[05:50] <Dechidechi> unless it's the deletion of the entire wiki itself
[05:50] <Kurokami Ryu> Yup.

[05:55] <Kurokami Ryu> Well I said what I wanted to say about the trivia thing.
[05:55] <Qu33k> yeah, bullshit memes belong in chat, after all

[05:56] <Kurokami Ryu> http://www.abload.de/img/1867_f555_960nwpjj.jpeg
[05:56] <ArcticaFrost> Did you put your opinion? :p 
[05:56] <Nothis> also contain salt
[05:56] <Caboose10032> If you ask me memes can also gtfo the glossary
[05:57] <Segar> saint paddy day
[05:57] <Segar> :3
[05:57] <Nothis> in general all meme should gtfo to glossary
[05:57] <Nothis> and what useful and infomative should be left behind in the trivia
[05:57] <Qu33k> Erin Go Brah-less!
[05:57] <Caboose10032> By that i meant removed from the glossary :V
[05:58] <Nothis> :V don't delete the glossary

[05:58] <Caboose10032> removed from != remove glossary, do you even read?

[05:58] <Caboose10032> Jeez
[05:58] <ArcticaFrost> Throw every damn meme to it.
[05:58] <Segar> ME ME ME!
[05:59] <Qu33k> sqwishy butt-chan!
[05:59] <Dechidechi> here echo
[[Suggestion#comm-206379]]
[05:59] <Dechidechi> this is what you want
[05:59] <Segar> so
[05:59] <Segar> neta page?
[05:59] <Dechidechi> neta page neta section w/e
[05:59] <Dechidechi> if you really want it
[05:59] <Caboose10032> seperate page pls
[06:00] <Segar> if we have lots of meme(neta) we should a seperate page
[06:00] <Dechidechi> jp wikiwiki does have a neta section on kanmusu page and that is prob why anon wants to add it
but neta =/= meme
[06:00] <ArcticaFrost> Meme page! :D 

[06:00] <Dechidechi> neta =/= Trivia
[06:00] <Segar> ok
[06:00] <Segar> :&gt;
[06:00] <EchoHolic> Ohhh
[06:01] <Dechidechi> Trivia is fact
[06:01] <Dechidechi> hard fact
[06:01] <EchoHolic> Maybe we should have one Netabare page
[06:01] <Segar> cruel fact
[06:01] <Nothis> peoples should know english wiki =/= wikiwiki
[06:01] <Kurokami Ryu> Just make subpages for neta...
[06:01] <Dechidechi> like the longest dick is 9meters
[06:01] <Segar> we are wikia
[06:01] <Segar> wikia=/= wikiwiki
[06:01] <EchoHolic> Just problem is finding a good english phrase to name the page
[06:01] <ArcticaFrost> Falukorv Page
[06:02] <Kurokami Ryu> We are sparta.
[06:02] <Dechidechi> wiki and wikia in terms of wiki refers to community collaborating to convey information
[06:02] <EchoHolic> Because not many people know what Netabare is lol
[06:02] <ArcticaFrost> Crap information page?
[06:02] <Segar> or we can enlarge glossary 
[06:03] <ArcticaFrost> Fandom?
[06:03] <Segar> put more meme neta w/e
[06:03] <Harunadesu> people can just generate new trivia anytime they want
[06:03] <Onnasis> ネタバレ ?
[06:03] <Zel-melon> ughh...now speaker is busted
[06:03] <Dechidechi> no you can't generate new trivia
[06:03] <Harunadesu> well new ship and stuff
[06:03] <Dechidechi> ships in history or fan-made ships?
[06:03] <Harunadesu> fan-made
[06:04] <Harunadesu> obv not history lol
[06:04] <Dechidechi> there is no trivia in that
[06:04] <Dechidechi> it's not proven
[06:04] <Kurokami Ryu> ^
[06:04] <Dechidechi> it's not fact
[06:04] <Dechidechi> it's a lore
[06:04] <Harunadesu> yea
[06:04] <Zel-melon> it's better to put that under like...a thread or something in the forum
[06:04] <Dechidechi> a story
[06:04] <Qu33k> last two ships in my first PVP fleet, are a waifu Yamato, and a level 16 Maruyu
[06:04] <Qu33k> F U, fellow TTK, just FU
[06:04] <Kurokami Ryu> Yamato
[06:04] <Kurokami Ryu> <3 
[06:04] <Dechidechi> Romeo and juliet didn't marry isn't a trivia, it's a story
[06:04] <Dechidechi> Shakespeare wrote Romeo and juliet is a trivia
[06:04] <Dechidechi> it's a fact
[06:05] <ArcticaFrost> Anyway, for now. We need a direction for trivia and we can deal with fandom, netore or hentai whatever you want.
[06:05] <Dechidechi> netore is genre
[06:05] <Dechidechi> that doesn't fall in the category of fandom or hentai
[06:05] <ArcticaFrost> <span class="me-username">* <span>ArcticaFrost</span></span> facepalm, that is the not the point right now.
[06:05] <EchoHolic> For now, we'll wait for more input about what people think is right for the trivia page
[06:05] <Dechidechi> Trivia is fact
[06:05] <EchoHolic> I'd like more admin input
[06:05] <Dechidechi> its that simple
[06:06] <ArcticaFrost> We need a direction for Trivia.
[06:06] <Dechidechi> you CAN'T argue with trivia
[06:06] <EchoHolic> And then I think we can sling out suggestions and gauge reactions lol
[06:06] <ArcticaFrost> Well put that on suggestion then.
[06:06] <Dechidechi> it's under echo's thread
[06:06] <ArcticaFrost> Not everyone is going to agree with you, me, caboose or other people.
[06:06] <EchoHolic> We're not deciding on ANYTHING right now, just to make things clear
[06:06] <Segar> you should just tell them trivia is trivia not meme or neta section
[06:06] <Dechidechi> you can't disagree with the definition of trivia
[06:06] <Dechidechi> it's in the dictionary
[06:07] <Dechidechi> and I mentioned on another suggestion that Netobare is prob what echo is looking for
[06:07] <Ninthsense> well covering the basics esp for people who have to prepare for first or 2nd event
[06:07] <Dechidechi> if the section is netobare, RJ is referred as a board can be included
[06:08] <Dechidechi> netabare*
[06:09] <Nothis> this is why we shouldn't let random anon edit :&gt;
[06:09] <EchoHolic> There is a definition of trivia yeah, but the motive right now is trying to find a middle ground and gauging community opinion of what we should do with the trivia section
[06:09] <ArcticaFrost> ^
[06:09] <EchoHolic> I know that it doesnt make sense
[06:09] <Segar> nothis I disagree
[06:09] <Nothis> only takes one sparkle for a problematic discussion
[06:09] <Dechidechi> people should just understand the difference between trivia and neta, so people SHOULD be arguing whether they want a trivia section or a neta section
[06:09] <ArcticaFrost> We should never had a Haruna war, Prinz, Yukikaze or this latest DD war.
[06:09] <Segar> not all the anon are bad
[06:09] <Nothis> ik
[06:09] <Nothis> but not all anon are good
[06:10] <ArcticaFrost> For whatever it is, Neta can get it own page
[06:10] <Segar> yeah so it is ok to let them edit
[06:10] <Segar> but if they make shit up
[06:10] <ArcticaFrost> And Trivia stay at is it BUT we need a direction what kind of information should be ok.
[06:10] <Segar> we should have a instruction for them
[06:10] <Nothis> i think they already did
[06:11] <Dechidechi> and Trivia that is a FACT can be added
[06:11] <Dechidechi> a FACT that pertains to the page
[06:11] <EchoHolic> Yeah dechi but we don't have a better name for naming the section
[06:11] <Qu33k> same fleet that I faced yesterday, CarDiv 1 at level 97 each
[06:11] <Qu33k> yup, Akagi with Stuka
[06:11] <ArcticaFrost> AND THE FACT IS A FACT YES BUT WHAT FACT IS RELEVANT?
[06:11] <Dechidechi> basically, if the information provided cannot be argued, its a trivia and can be added
[06:11] <ArcticaFrost> Like, when did they get kai ni?
[06:12] <Segar> Game facts
[06:12] <EchoHolic> How bout we not dicuss what the section should be named but what should be allowed/not allowed in the section
[06:12] <ArcticaFrost> Or is when they enter to service?
[06:12] <Segar> history facts
[06:12] <ArcticaFrost> That is what i'm trying to say.
[06:12] <Dechidechi> facts
[06:12] <Dechidechi> you can't argue
[06:12] <Dechidechi> that can be added
[06:12] <Qu33k> tell that to Faux News, Dechi. . . .
[06:12] <Dechidechi> unless you specifically call it "HIstorical Trivia"
[06:12] <Segar> isnt we have wikipedia`s entry for each kanmusu in reality?
[06:12] <Segar> doesnt*
[06:13] <Qu33k> (sorry)
[06:13] <Kurokami Ryu> *don't we have
[06:13] <Kurokami Ryu> :P 
[06:13] <Segar> MY GRAMMAR SUCKS
[06:13] <Segar> FUDGE
[06:13] <Kurokami Ryu> lol
[06:13] <EchoHolic> I understand that the section isn't named properly
[06:13] <Segar> Sucks in Grammars since 2003
[06:13] <Kurokami Ryu> Try harder Segar.
[06:13] <ArcticaFrost> So here is the thing, we are on the same page but question is, what kind of *fact* should be ok?
[06:13] <Segar> I CANT
[06:13] <Segar> I ALWAYS SUCK IN GRAMMAR
[06:13] <Kurokami Ryu> D:
[06:14] <ArcticaFrost> Because we could add 1000 facts to the page but that would be stupid, yes?
[06:14] <Dechidechi> if you only allow historical facts, just rename the trivia to historical trivia
[06:14] <EchoHolic> Lets pretend that it isn't named a "Trivia" section and say the nameless section is "Interesting things about this ship"
[06:14] <Dechidechi> as long as it's a fact, how does that explain stupidity?
[06:14] <EchoHolic> What would you include in the section then
[06:15] <EchoHolic> The point is not sticking to the name, rather what information the community thinks we should allow in the ship page
[06:15] <Dechidechi> the name allows what can be added
[06:15] <Dechidechi> ur textbook title has to pertain to the infor in the book
[06:16] <ArcticaFrost> You do realise that people is having a edit war right now on trivia, because half of the ass don't know what should on trivia.
[06:16] <ArcticaFrost> should be on*
[06:16] <Dechidechi> thus clarify ur Trivia category
[06:16] <Dechidechi> it's all down to definition
[06:16] <EchoHolic> Ok lets clear up the objective of the dicussion lol
[06:16] <ArcticaFrost> I have been on your side, damn it.
[06:16] <ArcticaFrost> Got damn it.
[06:16] <EchoHolic> We're trying to figure out what should be allowed in the ship page's bottom part
[06:16] <ArcticaFrost> ^
[06:17] <Qu33k> GET damn it is when Fusou drops
[06:17] <Segar> and should we do a serperate page for meme neta 
[06:17] <ArcticaFrost> Agree
[06:17] <Segar> (if I am right
[06:17] <EchoHolic> Yeah but that's a different matter
[06:17] <Dechidechi> that's a vote for the suggestion page @Echo, if the majority only want historical trivia, you'll have to rename the section to historical trivia
[06:17] <EchoHolic> Right now the outstanding opinion is no memes on the ship page, so what do we allow in a ship page
[06:18] <Kurokami Ryu> I don't think it^'s a different matter Echo.
[06:18] <EchoHolic> We could allow facts, but there is a possibility for support of other things
[06:18] <EchoHolic> Oh it's just a different way of looking at it
[06:18] <EchoHolic> I'm just posing the matter in a different light
[06:18] <EchoHolic> It doesn't hurt to look at it from different angles
[06:19] <Kurokami Ryu> People might respond different I you tell them that we could make an additional area.
[06:19] <Dechidechi> ur support has to be authentic
[06:19] <Dechidechi> if u got ur support from some random anon pft pls 
[06:20] <EchoHolic> Wiki pages are flexible in format, so we're trying to gather opinions of what people think is acceptable
[06:20] <EchoHolic> So that admins have a good base for moderating whatever the end product is
[06:20] <ArcticaFrost> Then write down on the suggestion what you think that *trivia* Fact* or whatever you consider should be down there on the ship page, if not at all.
[06:20] <Kurokami Ryu> I think it would be good to point the option for an additional area to trivia out.
[06:21] <Dechidechi> it's already under echo's post
[06:21] <Dechidechi> @AF
[06:21] <EchoHolic> Just a reminder this is just reaching out for opinions
[06:21] <EchoHolic> Nothing is gonna happen anytime soon lol
[06:21] <ArcticaFrost> So as long the fact is supported you are fine with it?
[06:22] <EchoHolic> Just confirming
[06:22] <Dechidechi> as long as the support is authentic yes
[06:22] <ArcticaFrost> Got damn it, it would take this long to get a general direction, holy crap.
[06:22] <ArcticaFrost> Oh well.
[06:22] <ArcticaFrost> Done for now that part.
[06:22] <Dechidechi> its the definition of fact, i don't see how you guys are looking at the matter in such a complicated way
[06:23] <Caboose10032> "details, considerations, or pieces of information of little importance or value."
[06:23] <EchoHolic> Because we're looking at the possibility of maybe doing something else with it as well
[06:23] <ArcticaFrost> Tell that to other anons.
[06:23] <ArcticaFrost> Or players.
[06:23] <EchoHolic> If it was this simple we wouldn't have edit wars lol
[06:24] <EchoHolic> I do agree that a giant Netabare page should exist to explain fan stuff
[06:27] <Qu33k> I am not used to this "below cap" thinking
[06:27] <Admiral Mikado> Neither am I
[06:27] <Qu33k> but I just realized that I'd be resources ahead to make a YamaSushi shot now
[06:27] <Dechidechi> I'm only below cap if i have enough spaces for maruyus
[06:27] <Qu33k> instead of after day reset
[06:27] <Qu33k> would get 6 hours of regen while at work
[06:27] <Segar> *make a Yamashiro shot now
[06:28] <Dechidechi> then when maruyus fills up all my space, i have no choice but to stock
[06:28] <Qu33k> vs the daily crafting 50x4
[06:28] <Qu33k> <span class="me-username">* <span>Qu33k</span></span> makes sign against evil in Segar's general direction
[06:28] <Qu33k> "avaunt!"
[06:28] <Segar> :&gt;
[06:29] <Nothis> last nopan sister complete
[06:29] <Nothis> yay so happy :&gt;

[06:31] <Qu33k> they are hella good 
[06:31] <Nothis> gonna move on to CA
[06:31] <Nothis> still a lot of CA needed to level
[06:31] <Qu33k> Atago is the only one of mine that isn't 75+
[06:31] <Qu33k> of the first line CA
[06:32] <Qu33k> Aoba is the other slacker 
[06:32] <Nothis> currently thinking about who i gonna level up 
[06:32] <Nothis> choukai or ashigara ?
[06:32] <Admiral Mikado> All my CAs except Takao-class are Lv. 91+ :&gt;
[06:32] <Qu33k> good question
[06:32] <Qu33k> Ashigara has her Kai Ni, so you know what you're getting
[06:32] <Dechidechi> The only CA not in my team is Takao :/ 
[06:32] <Qu33k> Chokai is getting one "soon"
[06:33] <Dechidechi> idk about keep her or not yet
[06:33] <Dechidechi> choukai is getting one this spring @qu33k
[06:33] <CreamX> level up choukai nothis . . 
[06:33] <Kurokami Ryu> http://abload.de/img/refresh4xu7f.jpg
[06:33] <Nothis> i prefer ashigara
[06:33] <Dechidechi> Devs said it on twitter already
[06:33] <CreamX> k
[06:33] <Nothis> need her x3 no2 and she is cloer to kai ni
[06:33] <Qu33k> and is probably going to be a bit better than Ashigara/Nachi
[06:33] <Dechidechi> Choukai K2 will be here by the end of may
[06:33] <Qu33k> (guessing)
[06:33] <Blasterion> Mutsuki Kai ni
[06:33] <Nothis> while it gonna take me 26 days of only PVP for choukai hitting asleast 70

wtf is a type 3 good for anyways
[07:11] <Blasterion> I can't find any good use for AA stuff at all
[07:12] <Admiral Mikado> [[User blog:Otakueisama/going crazy]]...

Oh my, look who's salty again...? :V
[07:12] <Zel-melon> HE'S BACKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
[07:12] <Zel-melon> oh what...there's nothing
[07:12] <Sshinka> Type 3 is for bombarding installations, it's also good for fleet AA protection when equipped on a BB (AA X 1.6)
[07:12] <Admiral Mikado> Sanshiki is necessary in order to deal any significant damage to installation-type enemies
[07:12] <Blasterion> How do I know if something is a installation
[07:13] <Blasterion> they are all girls
[07:13] <Admiral Mikado> Check the enemy page
[07:13] <Blasterion> =/
[07:13] <Admiral Mikado> [[Enemy vessel]]
[07:13] <Sshinka> Hoppo is installation , for instance
[07:13] <Magicrailgunner> Hiei, why go for the ship that already has 1HP left.... go for their flag...
[07:13] <Admiral Mikado> The list calls them "Land Base"
[07:14] <CreamX> http://imgur.com/Of9WRTh ah kashi
[07:14] <Kurokami Ryu> Installations are the ones you can't attack with torpedos.
[07:14] <Kurokami Ryu> :P 
[07:14] <Magicrailgunner> beat up hoppo for akashi
[07:14] <Blasterion> =/
[07:15] <Sshinka> Blaster... Type 3 is basically high caliber Flak ammo with high amount of shrapnel - it was good for nuking land-based Airstrips

[07:21] <Shadowofsora> i think i understand the 3-2 hassle now :v first node poi gets reck'd
[07:21] <Magicrailgunner> shiranui is cute
[07:21] <Akios> ? You mean A Sora or clearing 3-2?
[07:22] <Sshinka> preserve your nerves and try again - sparkle before each try
[07:22] <CreamX> gl on 3-2
[07:22] <Shadowofsora> clearing
[07:22] <Shadowofsora> obviously
[07:22] <Akios> Cause if its clearing then yeah :V Ru be all like
[07:22] <Shadowofsora> i think sparkling would just kill me
[07:23] <Sshinka> the point is in disabling all enemy ships before torpedo phase - that's when it hurts
[07:23] <Admiral Mikado> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZntQ-gSur4&amp;t=09m41s

OH LOL--
[07:24] <Shadowofsora> well she got already orange before torpedo phase
[07:24] <Magicrailgunner> darn
[07:25] <Akios> What up Rail?
[07:25] <Shadowofsora> and how would i disable them with just dd's?
[07:25] <Magicrailgunner> talking abut how Sora's poi got chuuha'd before torpedo
[07:25] <Xenzul> Aoba's, Aoba's, Aoba's, Aoba's
[07:25] <Caboose10032> Lol mikado, i disagree with Arin there, sea creatures are weird as fuck
[07:25] <Magicrailgunner> i'm just mindlessly tossing my subs at 2-3
[07:25] <Xenzul> Leave me aloneeee
[07:26] <Sshinka> make sure you have proper artillery based setups on your DDs
[07:26] <Sshinka> not torp based setups
[07:26] <Admiral Mikado> But Aoba is cute :&gt;
[07:26] <Shadowofsora> y removed all trops from them sadly i just have the bad standart red guns for them
[07:26] <Sshinka> if you have high luck DD put 3 guns on it
[07:27] <Akios> I just offered a little bit of my soul to RNG to make it to the boss node :&gt;
[07:27] <Sshinka> thats ok
[07:27] <Sshinka> low luck dd put 2 gun, 1 radar on it
[07:27] <Magicrailgunner> aoba is cute but she doesn't hold a candle to asashio
[07:27] <Ninthsense> double attack is probably better than triple guns since you can use turbines or radar on it
[07:27] <Ninthsense> just put 2x10 cm or 12.7 and a turbine/radar if you can
[07:28] <Sshinka> new TTK i doubt he has turbines
[07:28] <Akios> Could use damecons :v
[07:28] <Domesticated Cat> theresnoseaplane
[07:28] <Sshinka> that works too
[07:28] <Magicrailgunner> wish there was 12.7 cm triple gun mount c:
[07:28] <Akios> :&gt;
[07:28] <Akios> But there isn't
[07:28] <Akios> :'&gt;
[07:28] <Shadowofsora> i have 1 turbine and 2 radars i think maye just 1 radar
[07:28] <Magicrailgunner> kiyoshimo would love it, makes her seem more like a BB

[07:32] <Segar> I thought its that shadow
[07:32] <Segar> :v
[07:32] <Sshinka> 10cmHA is also a red gun - it's just it's also AA gun
[07:32] <Domesticated Cat> it's not a red gun.. but a main..
[07:33] <Magicrailgunner> doesnt main = red
[07:33] <Sshinka> yeah main
[07:33] <Magicrailgunner> but it's coloured green because it doubles as AA due to HA
[07:33] <Akios> lel Segar xD
[07:33] <Akios> That's why I call him Sora
[07:33] <Shadowofsora> interesting
[07:33] <Sshinka> 50 transports quest boss node trolling....
[07:33] <Shadowofsora> so [[10cm Twin High-angle Mount]] those green ones count as main too
[07:33] <Sshinka> yes
[07:33] <Shadowofsora> all that lokk like this?
[07:34] <Domesticated Cat> unless you're a color blind, rail
[07:34] <Sshinka> not all
[07:34] <CreamX> http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1956591?tags=kantai_collection
[07:34] <Magicrailgunner> no i'm not color blind, thanks for asking
[07:35] <Shadowofsora> and how do i know which are main guns and which not?
[07:35] <Sshinka> if you check it's page it will tell you if it's main gun, secondary gun, or just AA gun
[07:35] <Domesticated Cat> well I wasn't asking though :&gt;
[07:35] <Sshinka> above the card
[07:35] <Ninthsense> theres a page with a list
[07:35] <Ninthsense> but it can be confusing
[07:35] <Shadowofsora> just read it good to know
[07:36] <Magicrailgunner> wow cat rude
[07:36] <Magicrailgunner> lol
[07:36] <Domesticated Cat> was it now?
[07:37] <Magicrailgunner> nah, i don't really care

[07:39] <Segar> Madoki
[07:39] <Xenzul> Mikado is my gurl

[07:39] <Ninthsense> damoki
[07:40] <Domesticated Cat> just add some meshi
[07:40] <ArcticaFrost> Welp
[07:40] <ArcticaFrost> Mikado is my mom
[07:40] <ArcticaFrost> And Kuro is my dad
[07:40] <Ninthsense> who is kuro?
[07:40] <Domesticated Cat> is this unlimited AF? :3
[07:41] <Domesticated Cat> unlimited AF works would be the next hit among the admirals
[07:42] <Ninthsense> someone please choke this bitch 
[07:42] <Domesticated Cat> R-18 doujinshi

[07:48] <Domesticated Cat> I'll have fun with your next event ninth <3 
[07:48] <Magicrailgunner> how tall are the girls in kancolle?

[07:48] <Magicrailgunner> is there a reference list?
[07:48] <Admiral Mikado> As tall as you want them to be
[07:49] <Sshinka> this was funny question :P 
[07:49] <Kurokami Ryu> Wat...
[07:49] <WanWan101> :3
[07:49] <Kurokami Ryu> I feel like I missed something.
[07:49] <Domesticated Cat> well no specific list of it, just some guessing
[07:49] <Sylcion> xen you dont know our father?
[07:49] <Sylcion> man
[07:49] <Magicrailgunner> i was wondering how tall they'd be
cause the in-game isn't that accurate, since destroyers are as tall as the battleships
[07:50] <Admiral Mikado> Depends on the destroyer
[07:50] <Domesticated Cat> hmm you might compare the proportion
[07:51] <Kurokami Ryu> http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1956365

[07:53] <Domesticated Cat> flabby?
[07:54] <Sshinka> quests reset time approaches = lag increases
[07:55] <Admiral Mikado> http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1949905

PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFT-
[07:55] <Domesticated Cat> you still have 6 minutes! ganbatte!
[07:55] <WanWan101> <span class="me-username">* <span>WanWan101</span></span> rolling waiting for the reset time
[07:55] <Sshinka> my server usually has super lag arround quest reset time
[07:56] <Domesticated Cat> which server are you?
[07:56] <Sshinka> and 30 minutes after
[07:56] <Enferlain> no lag here
[07:56] <Kurokami Ryu> dito
[07:56] <Sshinka> Shortland Anchorage
[07:57] <Domesticated Cat> hmm hmm, shortland huh
[07:57] <Sshinka> yuup laggy as hell now
[07:57] <Domesticated Cat> or it might be your provider since most people would use them on that hour
[07:58] <Sshinka> nah my provider is awesome 24/7
[07:58] <Domesticated Cat> not even lag spikes on specific hours?
[07:58] <Sshinka> and i'm in Croatia
[07:58] <Sshinka> no spikes
[07:58] <Kurokami Ryu> Croatia has good ISPs?
[07:58] <Domesticated Cat> then, it's influx of people on the server..
[07:58] <Sshinka> some.. there's shitty ones too
[07:59] <Sshinka> basically this ISP is owned by Deutsche Telecom
[07:59] <Kurokami Ryu> Been there a few times.
[07:59] <Kurokami Ryu> Always had shitty net.
[07:59] <Kurokami Ryu> :P 
[07:59] <Admiral Mikado> Deutsche Telekom....... :v
[08:00] <Enferlain> Isn't it called the Bratwurst Server?
[08:00] <Sshinka> yeah yeah :P 
[08:00] <Enferlain> :( 
[08:01] <Sshinka> my stupid goverment sold the national telephone infrastructure to Deutsche Telekom some years ago... at least they are good as ISP
[08:01] <Kurokami Ryu> Erm
[08:02] <Kurokami Ryu> I guess that depends on the point of view.
[08:02] <Enferlain> my isp is fine too, even though I hate them
[08:02] <Kurokami Ryu> :P 
[08:02] <Magicrailgunner> Deutsche Telekom expanding beyond Alemania is their plan for the 4th Reich
[08:02] <Domesticated Cat> there might be someone saying 'just as planned'
[08:02] <Magicrailgunner> just like the EU &gt;:3
[08:02] <Kurokami Ryu> People in germany usually curse on the Deutsche Telekom.
[08:03] <Kurokami Ryu> Just ask Mikado about it.
[08:03] <Kurokami Ryu> :P 
[08:03] <Magicrailgunner> jfc chrome sucks on yosemite
[08:04] <Magicrailgunner> well

[08:04] <Enferlain> ISPs: All according to keikaku
[08:04] <Sshinka> for years
[08:05] <Magicrailgunner> do any of you play other games on DMM

[08:20] <Xenzul> dead people dont talk
[08:20] <WanWan101> woooo

[08:20] <WanWan101> lol
[08:20] <Domesticated Cat> muh sushi.. q.q
[08:21] <Kevadu> Cook?
[08:21] <Sylcion> im doing that though i need another Drum
[08:21] <Domesticated Cat> yep
[08:21] <Segar> weekly give you drum
[08:21] <Segar> :&gt;
[08:21] <YasenSuki> now use Sushi for PVP and boss kill
[08:21] <Kurokami Ryu> If you do it and still don't have enough steel then you're doing it wrong. :V
[08:21] <Domesticated Cat> but no rum in it..
[08:22] <Sylcion> i should do weekly yeh :V
[08:23] <Magicrailgunner> i have too much steel
[08:23] <Segar> :&gt; free drum every week
[08:23] <Kevadu> Too many cooks
[08:23] <Segar> Fried Salmon o/
[08:23] <Sylcion> (has 11 drums)
[08:23] <Kurokami Ryu> <span class="me-username">* <span>Kurokami Ryu</span></span> has 34
[08:23] <Kevadu> I do that weekly quest just to get rid of crappy equipment
[08:23] <Domesticated Cat> winning eleven
[08:23] <Kevadu> But I scrap a drum too when I do it
[08:23] <Kevadu> 'Cause I don't need more drums ;) 
[08:24] <Segar> ;) 17 drums
[08:24] <Domesticated Cat> scrapping drums for drums
[08:24] <Domesticated Cat> sounds legit
[08:24] <Kurokami Ryu> Drumception
[08:26] <Ninthsense> kev do you know how long it takes you to sparkle?
[08:26] <Kevadu> Around 2 min a run
[08:26] <Ninthsense> so 6 min total?
[08:26] <Kevadu> Yeah, roughly
[08:27] <Ninthsense> ok thanks
[08:27] <Domesticated Cat> our mission is to keep kev in a sparkling state..
[08:28] <Domesticated Cat> like a star
[08:28] <Kevadu> Before the maint for last event I had the great idea to try and sparkle literally every ship in my fleet...
[08:28] <Kevadu> ...that didn't work
[08:28] <Ninthsense> some ships are hard to sprkle
[08:29] <Kevadu> It was more just a time thing
[08:29] <Kevadu> That's a lot of ships
[08:30] <Ninthsense> thats true too
[08:30] <Magicrailgunner> don't sparkle low levels
[08:30] <Magicrailgunner> not worth it ;) 
[08:30] <Ninthsense> were you sparkling for event?
[08:30] <Kevadu> Yeah, I didn't know what ships I would need and figured I could save time during the event if I sparkled everyone first
[08:31] <Magicrailgunner> just sparkle the cream of the crop
[08:31] <Magicrailgunner> for each category
[08:31] <Ninthsense> sparkling some DD helps for support expeditions i guess
[08:32] <Kevadu> Not just support but even regular expeditions
[08:32] <Kevadu> I don't want to stop and sparkle new expedition ships if I'm in the middle of an event
[08:32] <Magicrailgunner> experimental single 46cm cannon
[08:32] <Magicrailgunner> that I would pay to see
[08:33] <Ninthsense> event is usually over before i need to sparkle expedition ships again
[08:33] <Kurokami Ryu> My level 84 Fusou just did a DA with 1dmg and 1dmg at night on a lvl33 Atago... there goes my S rank.
[08:33] <Ninthsense> do you do full sparkle 5?
[08:33] <Kurokami Ryu> Fuck you RNG...
[08:33] <Kurokami Ryu> ~_~
[08:33] <Sylcion> fukou
[08:33] <Kevadu> Yeah I full sparkle for 5
[08:34] <Magicrailgunner> Kusou
[08:34] <Magicrailgunner> what's her loadout?
[08:34] <Magicrailgunner> lol brb m80s
[08:38] <Ninthsense> probably had 46 that penalty
[08:38] <Kurokami Ryu> Me?
[08:38] <Sshinka> yup
[08:39] <Kurokami Ryu> LoL
[08:39] <Kurokami Ryu> Development never gave me a single 46cm.
[08:39] <Kurokami Ryu> The only two 46cm are on Sushi.
[08:40] <Kurokami Ryu> Fusou has 41cm guns.
[08:41] <WanWan101> time to sleep
[08:41] <WanWan101> <span class="me-username">* <span>WanWan101</span></span> rolls to bed
[08:41] <Sshinka> i also had one dodgy Akagi this pvp session.... had to go yasen to pop her
[08:41] <Segar> night
[08:41] <YasenSuki> cya later wan
[08:41] <Sshinka> nn
[08:41] <Kevadu> Dogey
[08:42] <WanWan101> already morning here, 4 a.m
[08:42] <WanWan101> <span class="me-username">* <span>WanWan101</span></span> continue rolling to bed
[08:42] <YasenSuki> still rolling? lol
[08:43] <Kurokami Ryu> [[Development?page=5#comm-123128]]
[08:43] <Kurokami Ryu> :V
[08:43] <Kurokami Ryu> Still like that today.
[08:43] <Kurokami Ryu> Never got a single one.
[08:43] <YasenSuki> :O
[08:44] <Kevadu> Only 50 tries?
[08:44] <WanWan101> <span class="me-username">* <span>WanWan101</span></span> not even trying to craft 46cm(s)
[08:44] <WanWan101> <span class="me-username">* <span>WanWan101</span></span> arrived at his bed
[08:45] <G Nanaya> 4 tries for 46 every days for 2 months but not a single one =.=
[08:45] <Kevadu> 50 isn't actually that many
[08:45] <Kurokami Ryu> Though since Dechi suggested it back then I'm spreading my tries some more.
[08:45] <Sylcion> i got em of my yamato classes thats all
[08:46] <G Nanaya> i got 2 from yamato and thats all
[08:46] <YasenSuki> <span class="me-username">* <span>YasenSuki</span></span> looking for radar, got 46cm instead
[08:46] <ArcticaFrost> http://www.twitch.tv/heskox1
[08:46] <YasenSuki> zz
[08:46] <Ninthsense> 46 development cheap compared to LSC
[08:47] <Kurokami Ryu> 50 tries x300 is 15000
[08:47] <Kurokami Ryu> If you look at it like that... nope it isn't.
[08:48] <YasenSuki> i have worst luck when crafting radar
[08:48] <YasenSuki> <span class="me-username">* <span>YasenSuki</span></span> have 2 T14
[08:48] <Kurokami Ryu> 0 here.
[08:48] <Ninthsense> like 1 taihou LSC is worth about 20 radar crafts just in baux and steel
[08:49] <G Nanaya> only have t21
[08:49] <Kurokami Ryu> With other words 50 tries is more than 2 times Taihou.
[08:50] <Kurokami Ryu> It's all relative Ninth.
[08:50] <YasenSuki> my best surface radar is T22 kai 4
lel
[08:50] <Ninthsense> perhaps depends on your luck
[08:50] <Kurokami Ryu> It's mainly a question of how often you try.
[08:50] <Kevadu> It's not like you're going to get Taihou on one try though
[08:50] <Kurokami Ryu> Depends.
[08:50] <Kevadu> You can easily spend 50 tries there
[08:50] <Ninthsense> yeah I mean you can LSC once a day or you can do 20 radar crafts for example
[08:51] <Ninthsense> so once you get done with LSC development is much easier to afford
[08:51] <Kurokami Ryu> I think I did more than 2000 tries on 46cm.
[08:51] <Kurokami Ryu> Never go one.
[08:51] <Flonnaru> i doubt you did 2000
[08:51] <YasenSuki> ....
[08:51] <Kevadu> You went from 50 to 2000?
[08:51] <Kevadu> Er, what?
[08:51] <Magicrailgunner> Wan lives in GMT + 8
[08:51] <Ninthsense> highly unlikely you counted to 2k :P 
[08:52] <Ninthsense> considering you have 10 fingers?
[08:52] <Kurokami Ryu> What are you saying Kev?
[08:52] <CreamX> http://seiga.nicovideo.jp/seiga/im4531474
[08:52] <CreamX> nsfw
[08:52] <Ninthsense> for me 46 cm development was on order of around 1 in 25
[08:52] <Kevadu> Also equipment crafting does depend on HQ level. There's some stuff you have a very low chance of getting until your HQ is higher
[08:53] <Magicrailgunner> &gt;implying that kongou is a sloppy eater
she's a real lady
[08:53] <Kurokami Ryu> I doubt my level 101 is too low...
[08:53] <Flonnaru> my chances are like 1 46cm for one week,its like 4*7 28 tries
[08:53] <Kurokami Ryu> Or what are you trying to say?
[08:59] <Magicrailgunner> no, they have it for RSC and development as well
it's onthe jp wikiwiki
[08:59] <Kurokami Ryu> Well I just did a rough calculation and I probaly did above 800 tries for 46cm since mid fall.
[08:59] <Xenzul> RSC?
[08:59] <Xenzul> wut
[08:59] <Xenzul> ?
[08:59] <Flonnaru> no clue,im out
[08:59] <Caboose10032> That's racist
[08:59] <Magicrailgunner> regular ship construction
[09:00] <ArcticaFrost> That is the first time i have ever heard about RSC
[09:00] <Flonnaru> same here
[09:00] <Ninthsense> ?
[09:00] <Magicrailgunner> no one uses "rsc" for "regular ship construction"
[09:00] <Caboose10032> :'3
[09:00] <Magicrailgunner> ???
[09:00] <Magicrailgunner> okay then
[09:00] <Flonnaru> its only construction lol
[09:00] <Kurokami Ryu> x)
[09:01] <Magicrailgunner> I like to shorten "construction" or "regular construction" to "rsc" lol
[09:01] <Hossinator> -.-
[09:01] <Ninthsense> doesnt really help if it takes 2 mins for everyone to figure out what rsc is lol
[09:02] <Magicrailgunner> true
[09:02] <Hossinator> I have a question Magic
[09:02] <Magicrailgunner> ...?
[09:02] <Hossinator> does your F5 key work?
[09:02] <Kurokami Ryu> construction is kind of a long word though.
[09:02] <Magicrailgunner> yes it does, why?
[09:02] <Flonnaru> : &gt;
[09:02] <G Nanaya> =.=
[09:02] <Hossinator> haha
[09:02] <Kurokami Ryu> Obvious incoming kick was obvious.
[09:02] <Flonnaru> btw,why does my f5 not work here
[09:02] <Hossinator> Ok, i needed that
[09:02] <Magicrailgunner> wonderful
[09:02] <Hossinator> hehe
[09:03] <Hossinator> you walked right into the trap
[09:03] <Flonnaru> was about to write 'inbefore kick' but was too slow
[09:03] <Kurokami Ryu> That was so obvious Hoss tbh
[09:03] <Hossinator> hehe
[09:03] <Kurokami Ryu> dito Flon
[09:03] <Hossinator> btw magic
[09:03] <Hossinator> im that mod
[09:03] <Hossinator> the kicker
[09:04] <Magicrailgunner> god, it's a real pain to reconfigure the ping phrases
[09:04] <CreamX> https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/11054357_844402408960585_8958712052505534413_n.jpg?oh=0b9f5a2cbac3847265efdf98f1bc4fae&amp;oe=55830750&amp;__gda__=1434466574_02599f2f2fc5f109696034bc44b08059
[09:04] <Kurokami Ryu> Magic is just too new to know that.
[09:04] <Caboose10032> What's a ping phrase?
[09:04] <Flonnaru> catch phrase? 
[09:05] <Caboose10032> I'm waiting
[09:05] <Tohoseiryu> Caboose :3
[09:05] <Magicrailgunner> uhhhh
basically the chat pings you when the phrases are written?
[09:06] <Hossinator> the chat pings?
[09:06] <Hossinator> ive heard nothing
[09:06] <Magicrailgunner> like if you type my name, "magic", "MRG" and stuff it pings me
[09:06] <Hossinator> ever
[09:06] <Hossinator> must be an addon
[09:06] <Hossinator> plug-in*
[09:06] <Magicrailgunner> and then i know that someone is mentioning/trying to talk to me
[09:06] <Caboose10032> Gensui has JS that notifies users when a certain word/phrase is posted in chat
[09:06] <Magicrailgunner> yeah, gensui taught us about it last night
[09:07] <ArcticaFrost> Caboose10032
[09:07] <Caboose10032> &gt;_&gt;
[09:07] <Xenzul> YOUR MOTHER IS A *beep* AND A *beep* AND THEN YOUR GONNA *beep* WITH A BUCKET OF *beep* YOUR MOTHERS GONNA *beep* AND THEN WERE ALL GONNA DIE BECAUSE *beep*

[09:26] <Admiral Mikado> Why is she a slut?
[09:26] <Tohoseiryu> Because kimono is 100000x better
[09:27] <Tohoseiryu> She's like a pillow :3
[09:27] <Admiral Mikado> That doesn't answer my question :V
[09:27] <Kurokami Ryu> Indicating that wearing less clothes makes you a slut.
[09:27] <Kurokami Ryu> ....
[09:27] <Tohoseiryu> Cuz 2 skimpy 
[09:27] <Tohoseiryu> :c
[09:28] <Admiral Mikado> Still don't see how that makes her a slut :V
[09:28] <Sylcion> does that make 25% of the kc ships a slut? o.o
[09:28] <Kurokami Ryu> It doesn't.
[09:28] <ArcticaFrost> Amagi looks like Haruna and Haruna is a slut.
[09:28] <ArcticaFrost> <span class="me-username">* <span>ArcticaFrost</span></span> runs away
[09:28] <ArcticaFrost> Hihihihhih

[09:32] <Admiral Mikado> *I know I'm gonna regret this...*
[09:32] <Tohoseiryu> pew pew went the USN :3
[09:32] <Sshinka> it just took USN too long to learn wtf to do.. that's all
[09:33] <ArcticaFrost> Daddy, mommy, i wuve you.
[09:33] <Sylcion> lmao
[09:33] <Wolfteampatner> anyone can help me?
[09:33] <Sylcion> *pats frost*
[09:33] <Segar> just ask away
[09:33] <Sylcion> here here they dont love us back ya know?
[09:33] <Segar> :&gt;
[09:33] <Admiral Mikado> With what?
[09:33] <Xenzul> if you cant read
[09:33] <Tohoseiryu> Except in the air, the US caught on real fast with that 
[09:33] <Sshinka> that they did
[09:33] <Xenzul> there willing to answer your question
[09:33] <Xenzul> mate
[09:33] <Segar> inb4 LOS
[09:34] <Tohoseiryu> Plus, it did help that Japanese had a shitty war plan to begin with
[09:34] <Tohoseiryu> :3
[09:34] <ArcticaFrost> Rare times.
[09:34] <ArcticaFrost> Shitty, not sure if that is the right thing to say, they were actually rather good on start.
[09:34] <Kurokami Ryu> Toho....
[09:34] <ArcticaFrost> However, they could not keep it up.
[09:34] <Tohoseiryu> Then it's shitty
[09:34] <Segar> <span class="me-username">* <span>Segar</span></span> is waiting for Frost
[09:35] <Kurokami Ryu> The americans catched up with air so fast for a reason.
[09:35] <Sylcion> if only they were able to inflict more dmg in pearl harbor things would've gone different and probably not in a good way
[09:35] <Kurokami Ryu> Not because they wanted to that much.
[09:35] <ArcticaFrost> There is several case.
[09:35] <Wolfteampatner> what to do with the left overs ship?
[09:35] <ArcticaFrost> Scrap them?
[09:35] <Admiral Mikado> ^
[09:35] <Segar> scrap mod 
[09:35] <Sshinka> The plans were awesome, but all of them decoded when raidioed and presented to USN
[09:35] <Wolfteampatner> i got them lie 10 full pages
[09:35] <Admiral Mikado> Scrap them or use them for modernisation
[09:36] <Kurokami Ryu> Use them for modernisation.
[09:36] <ArcticaFrost> And don't forget the pilots.
[09:36] <Wolfteampatner> thanks
[09:36] <ArcticaFrost> The IJN lacked of good pilots after the midway.
[09:36] <Sylcion> 19% kamikaze succes rate? xD
[09:36] <Sshinka> yeah
[09:36] <Wolfteampatner> and didnt even unlock the 3 fleet
[09:36] <Admiral Mikado> Then get to it
[09:37] <Tohoseiryu> Not planning for the long term is shitty to begin with, plus the whole Kantai Kessen doctrine, against a nation with more then 10 fold your industrial capacity, and then STILL PERUSING IT WHEN IT'S CLEAR THEY ARENT GOING TO DEVOTE THEIR ENTIRE FLEET TO ONE ENGAGEMENT 
[09:37] <Sylcion> GO COLLECT YASEN CLASS! (Sendai-Class)
[09:37] <ArcticaFrost> It's easy to judge now.
[09:37] <ArcticaFrost> But not on that time.
[09:37] <Kurokami Ryu> Toho it's by far not that easy.
[09:37] <Tohoseiryu> It was easy to judge then too.
[09:37] <Kurokami Ryu> ...
[09:37] <Sylcion> <span class="me-username">* <span>Sylcion</span></span> goes to grab popcorn
[09:38] <Wolfteampatner> sendai class hmm
[09:38] <ArcticaFrost> Not really.
[09:38] <Sylcion> yes Sendai, Jintsuu and Naka @wolfteam
[09:38] <Kurokami Ryu> I won't even start to argue about shit like that. : 3
[09:38] <Admiral Mikado> Sendai-class for 3rd fleet
Kongou-class for 4th fleet

Now get rollin'
[09:38] <ArcticaFrost> There was several high ranked Admiral in the USN that wanted to keep the BB project alive.
[09:38] <ArcticaFrost> That should say you something.
[09:38] <Wolfteampatner> 3rd class idk but the koungou is the oneechan left
[09:38] <Sylcion> frost will argue about it appearently xD
[09:39] <Kurokami Ryu> Yup.
[09:39] <ArcticaFrost> And you know from that BB was obsolete.
[09:39] <Tohoseiryu> Yamamoto apposed it for very good reasons, and seeing as Japan had just proved that large capital ships were dying with Repulse, Prince of Whales, etc.
[09:39] <Sylcion> <span class="me-username">* <span>Sylcion</span></span> hugs Wolfteam
[09:39] <Sylcion> kongou syndrome
[09:39] <ArcticaFrost> But things have not always been easy to predict.
[09:39] <Sshinka> BBs were the most useless class at pacific... both sides
[09:39] <Sylcion> I have been there
[09:39] <Wolfteampatner> haha
[09:39] <Sylcion> you poor soul
[09:39] <Kurokami Ryu> Uhm...
[09:39] <Kurokami Ryu> No.
[09:39] <Tohoseiryu> It was easy enough for the admiral of the combined fleet
[09:39] <ArcticaFrost> And japan never had any plan to win against USA, they only wanted to force USA to give up on pacific.
[09:39] <Sylcion> to scare them off
[09:39] <Xenzul> DID THAT GUY PLAY MOGAMI YET?
[09:39] <ArcticaFrost> But of course, as with all war, nothing goes acording as you wanted.
[09:39] <Sylcion> BOO
[09:40] <Magicrailgunner> <span class="me-username">* <span>Magicrailgunner</span></span> is tasting the salt
[09:40] <Magicrailgunner> truffle salt is good
[09:40] <Sylcion> hey frost ever seen the movie ''The final countdown''?
[09:40] <Magicrailgunner> it's cheaper than actual truffles too
[09:40] <ArcticaFrost> No, i have never seen it.
[09:40] <Admiral Mikado> Don't know about the film, but there's this song... :v
[09:40] <Wolfteampatner> anyhow can i know where to get the sendai class
[09:41] <Xenzul> <span class="me-username">* <span>Xenzul</span></span> facepalms
[09:41] <Sylcion> Its about the USS nimitz that gets warped back in time (from 1980) to right before the attack on Pearl harbor but they have all advanced planes with it etc
[09:41] <Xenzul> Not this shit again
[09:41] <ArcticaFrost> On the moooooon!
[09:41] <Admiral Mikado> Random drops everywhere or construction with minimum input
[09:41] <Xenzul> Not this shittu again
[09:41] <Sshinka> Wolf world 1-1 boss node drops them
[09:41] <Tohoseiryu> It was never going to work anyways. Try and defend it as you might, it's clearly a poor strategy that wiped up by blind patriots and rabid nationalists 
[09:41] <Sylcion> its from 1980 but still funny too see
[09:41] <ArcticaFrost> And that is not what you are? Blind patriot and rabid nationalist?
[09:42] <Magicrailgunner> so nimitz moved back with modern stuff
a feel-good film about how the Nimitz beats the shit outta the task force that wrecked Pearl?
[09:42] <Wolfteampatner> thanks
[09:42] <Tohoseiryu> Nope
[09:42] <Admiral Mikado> And a friendly reminder, Wolf.
The answers to simple questions like these are easily available on this wiki.
How about checking it first? :V
[09:42] <Tohoseiryu> Im objective to history
[09:42] <Sylcion> brb im gonna go get my medicines~
[09:42] <Sshinka> well u sound like one
[09:42] <Magicrailgunner> feel better, sylcion
[09:42] <Wolfteampatner> kinda hard to find ot
[09:42] <Sylcion> ty x3/
[09:42] <ArcticaFrost> And yet you are trashing the IJN like they was totally useless that driving by monkeys, yes?
[09:42] <Admiral Mikado> Wolf, this wiki has a search bar. Learn to use it
[09:42] <Tohoseiryu> By not applauding a bad strategy? 
[09:42] <Tohoseiryu> I'm not
[09:43] <Shadowofsora> nah they start dropping like hell after getting all of them once
[09:43] <ArcticaFrost> As thing are now, things turn out good for the allied
[09:43] <Tohoseiryu> They had the second most formidable force in the war
[09:43] <Wolfteampatner> thanks btw
[09:43] <ArcticaFrost> But we can never know if this and that would never have happend.
[09:43] <Sshinka> *naval force
[09:43] <Admiral Mikado> np
[09:44] <Blasterion> woot 40h exp done
[09:44] <Tohoseiryu> No Sshinka, their ability to power project made them, in my eyes, the most powerful force of the axis 
[09:44] <Admiral Mikado> Now do the 80h exp :P 
[09:44] <Blasterion> I am
[09:44] <Admiral Mikado> Good boy :) 
[09:44] <Blasterion> I want mah Tokyos
[09:45] <Blasterion> I amma do it while no events underway
[09:45] <Admiral Mikado> Everyone does, Balst
[09:45] <Blasterion> so I can stock up
[09:45] <Tohoseiryu> @Arctica: That's a poor line of thought
[09:45] <Magicrailgunner> power project
well... Japan was the only country in the axis that did not fight against developed nations save America and some Aussies
so yeah of course their power projection would be off the charts - everyone else in their vicinity sucked compared to them
[09:45] <Tohoseiryu> Wut
[09:45] <ArcticaFrost> ^
[09:46] <ArcticaFrost> We can never know in the end.
[09:46] <Wolfteampatner> what is flagship
[09:46] <Flonnaru> ok,that worth a kick
[09:46] <Admiral Mikado> Guess
[09:46] <Wolfteampatner> Defeat the flagship of an enemy fleet.

[09:46] <ArcticaFrost> So the only history we can follow is this one, the current one that actually happend.
[09:46] <Admiral Mikado> If you guess wrong I'll kick you
[09:46] <Magicrailgunner> Until the US rolled along, Japan fought against weak foes. That's why their ability to power project is immense, since their national development + industry is a lot better then the countries around them
[09:46] <Magicrailgunner> thats what I mean
[09:46] <Tohoseiryu> They fought Britain and the US in fields that the other two dominated for a long time, that's impressive 
[09:46] <Segar> lol Mikado
[09:47] <Sshinka> Wolf read combat guide on the wiki please
[09:47] <ArcticaFrost> This is pretty much same thing over and over again, Russia vs USA, USA vs China, all of them is equal stupid hard to answer.
[09:47] <Tohoseiryu> Unless your just another 'GERMAN WUNDERWAFFLE!111!!!!' poster
[09:47] <Admiral Mikado> *Wunderwaffe
[09:47] <Tohoseiryu> That's the joke
[09:47] <Admiral Mikado> :P 
[09:47] <Flonnaru> waffle lecker
[09:47] <Magicrailgunner> &gt;Britain
[09:47] <Admiral Mikado> Lecker Waffeln :3
[09:47] <Magicrailgunner> &gt;dominating in infantry combat
[09:48] <Tohoseiryu> But please, do point out how all those ones shouldn't be there ;) 
[09:48] <Magicrailgunner> wasn't that Germany?
[09:48] <Tohoseiryu> Nope
[09:48] <Flonnaru> someone else want a waffel
[09:48] <ArcticaFrost> Luftwaffle
[09:48] <ArcticaFrost> VÅFFLORR!
[09:48] <Magicrailgunner> like the great prussian infantry tradition or whatnot 
i know russia made glorious awesome tanks
[09:48] <Admiral Mikado> Luftwaffeln :9
[09:48] <Flonnaru> die fliegen dir in den mund rein
[09:48] <Flonnaru> xD
[09:48] <Wolfteampatner> \text{Shot Down} = \text{Floor((Ship AA } + \text{Floor(Fleet Anti-air} \times \text{Formation Modifier))} \times 0.2125\text{)} \text{Fleet Anti-air} = \text{Floor(} \sum^\text{All slots}\text{Equipment AA Bonus} \times \text{Equipment Modifier)} got some physics down here
[09:48] <Magicrailgunner> wolf pls
[09:49] <Tohoseiryu> Russia's tanks were actually only average until the T-55
[09:49] <Sshinka> Wolf just read the goddamn guides
[09:49] <Admiral Mikado> Mit höchster Präzision, wie's sich für die deutsche Luftwaffel gehört :V
[09:49] <Kurokami Ryu> http://s1325.photobucket.com/user/Pizzly25/media/luftwaffle3_zps95f081ed.gif.html
[09:49] <Magicrailgunner> well, it was a typical russian solution: "tanks getting blown up?" MOAR ARMOR
[09:49] <Magicrailgunner> MOAR GUNZ
[09:49] <ArcticaFrost> ^
[09:49] <Flonnaru> mit 1 kg schokoladenladung
[09:49] <Tohoseiryu> Until the 70s
[09:49] <Magicrailgunner> but the russians were masters of efficiency more than anything else
[09:50] <Admiral Mikado> Verdammt, etz hab' ich wieder Hunger... :T
[09:50] <Flonnaru> : &gt;
[09:50] <Wolfteampatner> my bad soory
[09:50] <Admiral Mikado> :&lt;
[09:50] <Kurokami Ryu> Dann geh dir etwas zu essen holen.
[09:50] <Tohoseiryu> In fact, after the Chieftain, the Russians never caught back up in the tank department' 
[09:50] <Kurokami Ryu> :P 
[09:50] <Magicrailgunner> they didn't need top-of-the-line tech since they have sheer numbers
so they could have average tanks that absolutely swamp German panzer divisions
[09:50] <Sshinka> that one fight that a lone KV did is still awesome.. and at the time it was a tank behind the time
[09:51] <Magicrailgunner> japan had no resources within the nation, an their manpower was extremely limited
which is why when the US counterattacked, at first with numbers, then technology, Japan couldn't win, especially since they expanded too far, too fast
[09:51] <Sylcion> back :3/
[09:51] <ArcticaFrost> I would not say T-90 is a bad tank but not really sure if they could be consider in pair with Challanger 2 or Leopard2
[09:51] <ArcticaFrost> But that is an another story.
[09:52] <Tohoseiryu> Russia never had a "swarm strategy" as RTS games and common lore would like you to believe. Russian tech was actually pretty good after 43, it's just that little kids on the internet glorify Germany to the extent that everything else looks like trash 
[09:52] <Admiral Mikado> I don't glorify Germany :&gt;
[09:52] <Magicrailgunner> &gt;Russian minesweeping tactics = send people into the field until all the mines blow up
&gt;not swarm strategy
[09:52] <Sshinka> single KV2 tank held whole 6th panzer division for whole day.... yeah spit on russian tanks
[09:52] <Admiral Mikado> But then again I'm not a little kid anymore :P 
[09:52] <Tohoseiryu> @Magical: I'm sure everyone here knows that
[09:53] <ArcticaFrost> german tanks was consider over engineered.
[09:53] <Admiral Mikado> Maus :&gt;
[09:53] <ArcticaFrost> I still don't understand the logic behind it.
[09:53] <Magicrailgunner> over-engineered? how?
[09:53] <Admiral Mikado> Compensating for something? :&gt;
[09:53] <ArcticaFrost> Tiger, Panther.
[09:53] <ArcticaFrost> And ofc maus.
[09:54] <Blasterion> Germans value quality over quantity
[09:54] <Magicrailgunner> ^they had to
[09:54] <Admiral Mikado> ^
[09:54] <Blasterion> ^
[09:54] <ArcticaFrost> Things that get ridiculous hard to build.
[09:54] <Magicrailgunner> the axis nations were limited in manpower so they had to win with tech
[09:54] <Sshinka> think Maus never saw actual combat tho
[09:54] <Magicrailgunner> but once some of that tech gets captured it can be reverse-engineered
[09:54] <Blasterion> YAY HOUSHOU KAI
[09:54] <ArcticaFrost> I consider Panther and Tiger as rather good tanks.
[09:54] <Admiral Mikado> Considering how fucking huge and impractical the Maus was, I'm hardly surprised :V
[09:54] <Tohoseiryu> I'm loling irl, the "Human mine sweepers" was a myth that originated in Berlin in the 1950s to act as a propaganda tool. Wanna see a real Russian mine sweeper? 
[09:54] <Kitsuboshi> afternoon
[09:55] <ArcticaFrost> But did they really need King tiger, Jagdtiger?
[09:55] <Magicrailgunner> and since America was untouched by war (except pearl harbor), their R&amp;D could focus on making better and better stuff
[09:55] <ArcticaFrost> Why even tech Maus?
[09:55] <Kurokami Ryu> Hey Kitsu.
[09:55] <Kitsuboshi> Kuro~
[09:55] <ArcticaFrost> Seems like Hitlers personal wish.
[09:55] <Kitsuboshi> it's been awhile
[09:55] <Kurokami Ryu> ^^
[09:55] <Sshinka> German turetless tank hunters actually performed very good
[09:55] <ArcticaFrost> Indeed
[09:56] <ArcticaFrost> Many of them did it really good.
[09:56] <Magicrailgunner> "human minesweeper" = penal battalions
[09:56] <Magicrailgunner> ofc they wouldn't send the real soldiers into die first
[09:56] <ArcticaFrost> Oh yeah.
[09:56] <ArcticaFrost> I remember that.
[09:56] <Kurokami Ryu> So I see everybody arguing about a topic x and apparently most people around should get there fact right. Smashing around some half knowledge they obviously have from games etc.. Now what should I do there? Add in and say something just to make things worse? Hm.... nah. I'll grab some popcorn instead. Let's watch the world burn.
[09:56] <Magicrailgunner> and since they had no real minesweeping equipment, they were pretty mcuh expected to have the mine blow up on them
[09:56] <Kurokami Ryu> :P 
[09:56] <Tohoseiryu> http://www.o5m6.de/pt_34.html
[09:56] <Tohoseiryu> That was German POWs
[09:57] <ArcticaFrost> Maus :p 
[09:57] <Sylcion> that thing looks weird o.o
[09:57] <Someguyjumping> super heavy tank
[09:58] <ArcticaFrost> Trololo http://new2.fjcdn.com/comments/I+was+freaked+out+by+a+huge+tank+called+landkreuzer+_c23ed7775c606afed5ca0af40a797ec5.jpg
[09:58] <Tohoseiryu> Maus was probably the worst choice ever in the history of German tank development
[09:58] <Magicrailgunner> "The first Independent Engineer Tank Regiment with eighteen mine rollers was fielded in October 1943"
so yeah, penal battalions before they brought out this nice new technology
[09:58] <Kurokami Ryu> Arc that thing was called Ratte
[09:58] <Tohoseiryu> Source?
[09:58] <Admiral Mikado> Is that a 46cm Twin Gun Mount? :V
[09:58] <Kurokami Ryu> Just a blueprint project though.
[09:59] <Sshinka> what was it... that tank battalion manned by non-german crews that stopped russian invasion for quite some time? what was the name of the battle?
[09:59] <Kurokami Ryu> "Landkreuzer Ratte" was it's name.
[09:59] <ArcticaFrost> And don't forget P 1000
[09:59] <Ninthsense> m1 garand better than german rifles
[09:59] <ArcticaFrost> If you want to be that guy :) 
[10:00] <Kurokami Ryu> And no Mikado
[10:00] <Kurokami Ryu> No 46cm guns.
[10:00] <Admiral Mikado> :&lt;
[10:00] <ArcticaFrost> Against certain rifles, yes.
[10:00] <Kurokami Ryu> 28cm ones.
[10:00] <Someguyjumping> all for the sturmgewehr 
[10:00] <Kurokami Ryu> Seriously get your facts right guns. :V
[10:00] <Magicrailgunner> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mine_roller
[10:00] <Admiral Mikado> Oh noez, I'm terribly sorry :Λ
[10:00] <Kurokami Ryu> Not just posting random stuff.
[10:00] <ArcticaFrost> I mean, STG 44 was pretty brutal for it's time.
[10:01] <Kurokami Ryu> I wasn't talking about you Mikado,
[10:01] <Admiral Mikado> Oh okay :&gt;
[10:01] <Kurokami Ryu> More of a general statement.
[10:01] <Someguyjumping> first assault rifle wasn't it?
[10:01] <Someguyjumping> followed by the AK
[10:01] <Kurokami Ryu> I see people talking about a lot stuff here and most don't even seem to know what they're talking about.
[10:01] <Kurokami Ryu> &lt;_&lt;
[10:01] <ArcticaFrost> STG 44 would be the face out for the modern assault rifle after all.
[10:02] <Sshinka> btw the german support weapon (heavy machine gun) from WW2 is still used in here... it was used in ex yugoslavia too.. we call it "Garonja" (Smokey), and lots of Mauser 48 carabines were used in the war too.
[10:02] <Tohoseiryu> @Ryu: That's a pretty pretentious statement 
[10:02] <Sylcion> I can make some statements if you want <3 
[10:02] <Magicrailgunner> and assuming that wiki is wrong
then your source says that "The first mine-rolling detachments were formed in May 1942"
eh
[10:03] <Magicrailgunner> anyway, @Toho, do you knwo if the mine rollers would detonate anti-personnel mines as well as anti-tank mines?
[10:03] <Tohoseiryu> And that's your source that they used penal units before that?
[10:03] <Kurokami Ryu> Pretentious? I'm almost getting a headache here about some of the stuff I read.
[10:03] <Kurokami Ryu> So much I didn't even try to correct it.
[10:03] <Tohoseiryu> That depends on the mine, really
[10:04] <Admiral Mikado> Now imaging having those headaches every fucking day you spend here.
Welcome to my world :V
[10:04] <ArcticaFrost> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shtrafbat
[10:04] <Kurokami Ryu> I see your pain...
[10:04] <Magicrailgunner> no, i'm saying that the mine rolling detachments came out after Operation Barbarossa was repulsed, and before it came out, penal battalions were often used to search for mines
[10:04] <Sylcion> Mom <3 do it for your children
[10:04] <Admiral Mikado> FUck them
[10:04] <Sylcion> OHNO YOU DIDNT
[10:04] <Sylcion> FROST WHAT IS DIS
[10:04] <Tohoseiryu> @Ryu: "I'm so good I and above you all that I wont even try to 'correct you'" 
[10:04] <Kurokami Ryu> lol
[10:04] <Admiral Mikado> YES I DID
[10:04] <Kurokami Ryu> No Toho
[10:04] <Sylcion> ABANDONING US AGAIN EH?
[10:04] <Magicrailgunner> "Most prisoners were transferred to the mine-clearing battalions for trampler duty if they survived infantry combat long enough to risk returning to a regular unit."
[10:05] <ArcticaFrost> ^
[10:05] <Tohoseiryu> And I asked for a source for it
[10:05] <Magicrailgunner> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shtrafbat#Infantry_battalions
[10:05] <Tohoseiryu> Prisoners being a key, and vital word there
[10:05] <Kurokami Ryu> More like "I know that BS is wrong but I'm way to lazy to correct it and I don't want to join that stupid argument anyway. I rather grab some popcorn."
[10:05] <Magicrailgunner> Manazeev, Igor, A 'Penal' Corps on the Kalinin Front, Journal of Slavic Military Studies, Vol. 15, Issue 3, September 2002 OCLC 201968754
[10:06] <Kurokami Ryu> Sorry for being a lazy bastard.
[10:06] <Magicrailgunner> "prisoners" is a really liberal term in soviet russia, any one suspected of political disloyalties was a "prisoner", not just Germans
[10:06] <Kurokami Ryu> But I don't like arguments in general actually.
[10:06] <ArcticaFrost> Welp, who are you cheering on Kuro :p 
[10:07] <Kurokami Ryu> Nobody?
[10:07] <Tohoseiryu> @Ryu: Yeah, that's called being pretentious @Magical: Interesting, I never knew they actually used them
[10:07] <Kurokami Ryu> Nobody do cheer up, all hope lost anyway. :P 
[10:07] <Admiral Mikado> Kuro just want to enjoy the flame war
[10:07] <Kurokami Ryu> *to
[10:07] <Kurokami Ryu> ¨Mikado got it. :3
[10:07] <ArcticaFrost> Penal battalion is infamous for what they had to do.
[10:07] <Magicrailgunner> @Toho, if you can read russian, or wanna try your and with google translate, http://iremember.ru/infantry/golbraikh/golbraikh_r.htms
[10:07] <Sshinka> what was it? about 500'000 Japanese soldiers died in russian work-camps after the war. 700'000 from japanese sources
[10:07] <Magicrailgunner> story of a dude who commanded one of the penal battalions
[10:08] <Tohoseiryu> Nice. I'll save the link and read it some time
[10:08] <Admiral Mikado> Don't make me learn Russian, guys... :T
[10:08] <Sshinka> it was rare for PoW to return from Soviet Union
[10:08] <Kurokami Ryu> ^ Translated as I'll save it for later and actually never read it.
[10:08] <ArcticaFrost> lol, true that.
[10:08] <Ninthsense> poor russian prisoners
[10:09] <Kurokami Ryu> We all know what happens to stuff you "save for later". :P 
[10:09] <Magicrailgunner> I mean, russian units were famous for always having a political officer attached to them, some of them plainclothes (disguised as normal soldier), and they would arrest or shoot any soldier that voiced dissent
[10:09] <Ninthsense> probably didnt treat their people any better though
[10:09] <Magicrailgunner> hell, there's a whole article about it lol
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_commissar
[10:09] <ArcticaFrost> Welp, i will always consider Stalin the number one and Hitler as number 2, very close to number one.
[10:10] <Kurokami Ryu> Magic you think any nation was better? That goes for many armies.
[10:10] <Ninthsense> stalin number 1 what
[10:10] <Kurokami Ryu> Germans had that, japanese had that.
[10:10] <ArcticaFrost> Oh sorry.
[10:10] <Tohoseiryu> @Kuro: Ah, a personal insult. How petty. 
[10:10] <ArcticaFrost> Top 10 Evil :p 
[10:10] <Kurokami Ryu> What? Where?
[10:11] <ArcticaFrost> <span class="me-username">* <span>ArcticaFrost</span></span> hugs mom.
[10:11] <Ninthsense> where is obama on that list?
[10:11] <Tohoseiryu> We all know what happens to stuff you "save for later".
[10:11] <Sylcion> lovely arguments as always &gt; &gt;
[10:11] <Magicrailgunner> @Ryu, there's no need to be antagonistic
Of course I know that many other nations did that, but I was trying to show how the penal battalion's "prisoners" weren't just POWs
[10:11] <Tohoseiryu> Then again, this could be a joke
[10:11] <Kurokami Ryu> Joke?
[10:11] <Kurokami Ryu> Nah.
[10:11] <Kurokami Ryu> More like a fact.
[10:11] <Hossinator> @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
[10:11] <Hossinator> need more @

[10:11] <Kurokami Ryu> If you think that fact is an insult then I'm sorry for you. lol
[10:11] <Sylcion> NO THE DUTCH WERE OP
[10:11] <Tohoseiryu> Ah, so you are petty then. Right, noted. 
[10:11] <Sylcion> <span class="me-username">* <span>Sylcion</span></span> runs
[10:12] <Admiral Mikado> Hold it right there, Toho.
[10:12] <ArcticaFrost> DUTCH NAVY CRUSHED THE SWEDISH NAVY
[10:12] <ArcticaFrost> THAT WAS A SAD DAY!
[10:12] <ArcticaFrost> :p 
[10:12] <Ninthsense> facts can be insults tho?
[10:12] <Sylcion> we did what naow? o.o
[10:12] <Sylcion> I MEAN
[10:12] <Sylcion> OFCOURSE
[10:12] <Sylcion> I GUESS
[10:12] <Tohoseiryu> What fact
[10:12] <Kurokami Ryu> Apparently Nitnth.
[10:12] <Kurokami Ryu> Sorry, Ninth.
[10:12] <ArcticaFrost> I WILL NEVER FORGET IT, THAT WAS LIKE 300 YEARS AGO!
[10:12] <Kurokami Ryu> lol Arc.
[10:12] <Sylcion> OHNOOOOO
[10:13] <Sylcion> WE WILL DO IT AGAIN WITH OUR PARTY HATS
[10:13] <Sylcion> PARTY HAT CRUISERS MAN
[10:13] <Tohoseiryu> There was no fact, only personal insult. 
[10:13] <Admiral Mikado> Just drop it already
[10:13] <Sylcion> imma head to bed now :3/ nighty~~
[10:13] <Tohoseiryu> Sure. 
[10:13] <Kurokami Ryu> Seem like Toho is now pretty pissed about me. And that's excactly why I don't like to join arguments. People always get worked up on argument and can't get it calm and seriously.
[10:13] <Kitsuboshi> night syl

[10:16] <ArcticaFrost> Not going to deny that.
[10:16] <Admiral Mikado> How do I declared war? :V
[10:16] <Kurokami Ryu> :&lt;
[10:17] <Tohoseiryu> And then Sweden lost. 
[10:17] <Tohoseiryu> Rest in RIP
[10:17] <Magicrailgunner> you guys were attacking britain when charlemagne was king
[10:17] <Tohoseiryu> :c
[10:17] <Kurokami Ryu> "Rest in rest in piece". Rest in RIP
[10:17] <Kurokami Ryu> ...wat.
[10:17] <Ninthsense> i wonder if anyone actually did any statistics on what countries are the best at war
[10:17] <Kevadu> I was attacking Britain before it was cool
[10:17] <ArcticaFrost> My knowledge about viking era is pretty much zero.
[10:18] <Magicrailgunner> and it lasted all the way until Georgia was destroyed... for the second time
[10:18] <Kurokami Ryu> WHAT ARC
[10:18] <Tohoseiryu> @Kuro: You've never seen a montage parody? :P 
[10:18] <ArcticaFrost> The only thing i know is that we went to war with Denmark, to many times.

[10:39] <Kitsuboshi> if Haruna was here we'd be getting spammed
[10:39] <Kitsuboshi> you have to do a set up and it'll only ping you if you have it xen
[10:39] <Kurokami Ryu> I heared about that earlier already.

[10:54] <Alonne> i want to lsc but i'm too greedy!
[10:55] <Segar> I dont want to LSC right now
[10:55] <Segar> unless I get my ammo to softcap
[10:55] <Alonne> how much do you have?
[10:55] <Magicrailgunner> Segar i thought you had below-LSC level ammo just a few hours ago?
[10:55] <Segar> 8k
[10:56] <Caboose10032> No bullying Maruyu, Magic
[10:56] <Segar> still
[10:56] <Magicrailgunner> ok no bully the maru
[10:56] <Segar> it might takes me a couple day to restock
[10:56] <Hossinator> you missed earlier dechi
[10:56] <Hossinator> http://i.imgur.com/e7xN10b.png
[10:56] <Segar> 17k ammo in a week
[10:56] <Admiral Mikado> I can get at least 6k ammo in a day
[10:56] <Kitsuboshi> lol
[10:57] <Segar> ima not doing 2 5 21
[10:57] <Alonne> lol
[10:57] <Segar> if I do that I can get it faster
[10:57] <Kitsuboshi> you got trolled rail
[10:57] <Dechidechi> 17k ammo in a week is slow
[10:57] <Segar> inb4 tomorrow
[10:57] <Magicrailgunner> I got trolled?
[10:57] <Dechidechi> you can get 7k ammo 7k fuel and infinite steel in one day
[10:57] <Alonne> yup
[10:57] <Magicrailgunner> sigh
[10:57] <Dechidechi> + overnight baux
[10:58] <Segar> just tokyos and 2
[10:58] <Segar> ?
[10:58] <Alonne> where do you find infinite steel!

[10:58] <Shadowofsora> i think infinite steel is a lie :3
[10:58] <Segar> or some other combination?
[10:58] <Admiral Mikado> Tokyo Express gives you more steel than you could ever use.
[10:58] <Kitsuboshi> ^
[10:58] <Admiral Mikado> Just look at my resources... :V
[10:58] <Alonne> i need more steel i only have 17 k
[10:58] <Admiral Mikado> [[User:Admiral Mikado]]
[10:59] <Kitsuboshi> too much steel need other stuff
[10:59] <Dechidechi> both tokyo gives 1000+ (steel) / 3 hr
[10:59] <Admiral Mikado> ^
[10:59] <Segar> dechi
[10:59] <Shadowofsora> what is tokyo express?
[10:59] <Segar> so for maximum ammo I can go 2 5 tokyo 1?
[10:59] <Dechidechi> expedition 37 and 38
[10:59] <Shadowofsora> 39?
[10:59] <Admiral Mikado> Exp. 37 &amp; 38
[11:00] <Admiral Mikado> 東京急行
東京急行（弐）
[11:00] <Segar> (judging by the hour rate
[11:00] <Segar> hourly rate*
[11:00] <Admiral Mikado> Yes, Segar
[11:00] <Shadowofsora> the table says 270 + 200 that's far away from 1000 dechi
[11:00] <Segar> got it
[11:00] <Dechidechi> technically yes, if you're willing for that off trade of lose more fuel to get same equivalent ammo
[11:00] <Segar> starting tomorrow
[11:00] <Alonne> damn i'm stuck in the Exp.30
[11:00] <Dechidechi> but I do prefer 21 tho
[11:00] <Alonne> i need level up my ss
[11:01] <Segar> my fuel is 4 times more than ammo...
[11:01] <Segar> :v
[11:01] <Segar> 3*
[11:01] <Segar> I can still do 2 5 21
[11:01] <Dechidechi> k
[11:01] <Segar> overnight 9 11 13
[11:02] <Dechidechi> if you're getting 5 with GS ok, but if you're not, might as well do 21 in place of 5
[11:02] <Magicrailgunner> you can also get fuel, ammo, and steel 2/4/11 with naka
lol
[11:02] <Hossinator> -.-
[11:02] <Kurokami Ryu> @Shadow
That's per hour.
[11:02] <Segar> I can do 21 and tokyo 1
[11:02] <Segar> the problem with 5 is 
[11:02] <Kurokami Ryu> dechi said "both tokyo gives 1000+ (steel) / 3 hr"
[11:02] <Segar> the sparkle will gone really fast
[11:02] <Segar> be*
[11:02] <Hossinator> sparkle + landing crafts
[11:03] <Hossinator> x great success
[11:03] <Dechidechi> ^
[11:03] <Dechidechi> GS
[11:03] <Segar> pfft no boat
[11:03] <Dechidechi> always do tokyo with GS
[11:03] <Magicrailgunner> if you need badly you can risk a mamiya or irako?
[11:03] <Segar> no
[11:03] <Segar> why
[11:03] <Hossinator> save those for event
[11:03] <Dechidechi> you can only bring 3 daihatsu to exped 38
[11:03] <Segar> one 1-1 run is good enough for couple runs
[11:03] <Dechidechi> exped 37 allows 0 free ships
[11:03] <Segar> dont have any boat
[11:03] <Segar> so w/e
[11:03] <Segar> ima just gonna rush lots of ammo first

[11:11] <Admiral Mikado> I prefer to waste my steel for obvious reasons :V
[11:11] <Segar> still
[11:11] <Segar> :&lt; 吃屎吧！
[11:11] <Flonnaru> 20 bauxit is either recipe?
[11:11] <Admiral Mikado> Yes
[11:12] <Segar> yeah i think so
[11:12] <Flonnaru> then everything else doesnt matter : s
[11:12] <Admiral Mikado> It's either 20/10/10/20 or 10/10/20/20
[11:12] <Dechidechi> just waste (steel) 
[11:12] <Admiral Mikado> Well duh
[11:13] <Flonnaru> i mean it doesnt matter for calculation which recipe he took
[11:13] <Segar> on the other side I still want more Reppu and 46
[11:13] <Dechidechi> i want more AP shells
[11:13] <Flonnaru> ive got 8 reppus and need ap shells...
[11:13] <Segar> yeah and more AP shells
[11:13] <Dechidechi> i want to make another type 1
[11:13] <Segar> and good radars
[11:14] <Sshinka> T32 radar=0 T14 radar=0 AP shell=0
[11:15] <Segar> once tokyo2 is back ima gonna switch it to 21
[11:15] <Sshinka> just no luck at all with those
[11:17] <Segar> inb4 ima getting my first akiduki thursday
[11:17] <Flonnaru> how?
[11:17] <Segar> _(:з」∠)_

[11:17] <Flonnaru> nvm then
[11:17] <Segar> akiduki gun
[11:17] <Segar> hax 
[11:17] <Segar> :&gt;
[11:17] <Dechidechi> imagine when akizuki is farmable on event map
[11:17] <Dechidechi> :&gt;
[11:17] <Admiral Mikado> Oh boy
[11:18] <Flonnaru> farmstorm incoming
[11:18] <Crazy teitoku> @Sshinka maybe try crafting AP shells at next event :&gt;
[11:18] <Segar> I hope they put Prinz to LSC
[11:18] <Admiral Mikado> So many Akizuki guns... D:
[11:18] <Segar> SO I CAN WASTE MY RESOURCE AGAIN
[11:18] <Dechidechi> it's raining akizuki guns
[11:18] <Segar> ヽ｀、ヽヽ｀ヽ｀、ヽヽ｀ヽ｀、ヽヽ༼ຈ ل͜ຈ༽ﾉ☂ ɪᴛs ʀᴀɪɴɪɴɢ akizuki gun! ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ☂ ヽ｀ヽ｀、ヽヽ｀ヽ｀、｀ヽ｀
[11:18] <Flonnaru> did someone find out what the effect of improving akizukis gun?
[11:18] <Admiral Mikado> More damage
[11:18] <Segar> usually more dmg
[11:18] <Dechidechi> it's just the general +1 +2 +3 dmg
[11:19] <Flonnaru> it doesnt affect CI rate?
[11:19] <Segar> (as the main gun
[11:19] <Admiral Mikado> No
[11:19] <Segar> dont think so
[11:19] <Sshinka> on friday i get one Mayagun and one AkizukiGun. that makes it 2 Akiguns and 1 Mayagun total... think it's enough for next event... 
[11:19] <Dechidechi> it's not called mayagun :&gt;
[11:19] <Segar> 12.7+FD
[11:19] <Sshinka> i call it that :P 
[11:19] <Flonnaru> well screw improving them
[11:19] <Dechidechi> oh well
[11:19] <Segar> well
[11:19] <Segar> maya doesnt come with that gun
[11:19] <Dechidechi> ^
[11:20] <Flonnaru> sadly
[11:20] <Flonnaru> but otherwise it would be farmable
[11:20] <Sshinka> but only she can make it
[11:20] <Segar> but akiduki does 
[11:20] <Dechidechi> it's like you don't call quint torp shimakaze torp
[11:20] <Segar> WRONG
[11:20] <Segar> FUBUKI CAN MAKE THAT GUN
[11:20] <Segar> oh
[11:20] <Segar> wait
[11:20] <Segar> ima dumb
[11:20] <Dechidechi> but shimakaze is the only one that can upgrade quint torp in akashi
[11:20] <Segar> thas 10+FD
[11:20] <Segar> :v
[11:20] <Sshinka> buki can make only 10cm one
[11:20] <Segar> DUMB SEGAR
[11:20] <Segar> DUMB
[11:21] <Segar> Prinz LSC-able Akizuki Nowaki droppable 
[11:21] <Segar> if the script goes right
[11:21] <Sshinka> gonna spend the rest o mats on trying to craft AP shells and radars after that
[11:21] <Admiral Mikado> Nowaki becoming droppable is the most likely among these
[11:21] <Flonnaru> like isokaze *laughs*
[11:21] <Dechidechi> not like you need more nowaki
[11:21] <Segar> who was the E1 reward for fall? 
[11:21] <Admiral Mikado> Isokaze :&gt;
[11:22] <Segar> or which
[11:22] <Flonnaru> E1 was...useless stuff
[11:22] <Dechidechi> T91?
[11:22] <Admiral Mikado> Equipment
[11:22] <Admiral Mikado> T91
[11:22] <Segar> oh nvm....
[11:22] <Blasterion> I AM HOME
[11:22] <Sshinka> hey hey
[11:22] <Segar> it reminds me something really bad
[11:22] <Admiral Mikado> E-2: Akizuki
E-3: Pringles
E-4: Nowaki
[11:22] <Segar> that hurt me
[11:22] <Segar> ....
[11:22] <Dechidechi> 3 hibiki?
[11:22] <Admiral Mikado> How's your Hibiki doing, Segar? :V
[11:22] <Dechidechi> 3rd?
[11:22] <Segar> STOP 
[11:22] <Sshinka> but winter event E1 E2 equipement rewards were rather OP
[11:22] <Segar> NO
[11:23] <Segar> OUCH
[11:23] <Flonnaru> indeed they were
[11:23] <Blasterion> Akatsuki no Suihenseni SHOURII wa Kizaminasai!
[11:23] <Flonnaru> where is reppu kai 
[11:23] <Dechidechi> E3 equipment is OP too
[11:23] <Dechidechi> that is if you did hard
[11:23] <Admiral Mikado> *Akatsuki no Suiheisen ni Shouri wo kizaminasai!
[11:23] <Flonnaru> wasnt it E-2
[11:23] <Segar> ༼ つ ಥ_ಥ ༽つ SHINDEN KAI༼ つ ಥ_ಥ ༽つ
[11:23] <Admiral Mikado> ༼ つ ಥ_ಥ ༽つ SHINDEN KAI༼ つ ಥ_ಥ ༽つ
[11:24] <Flonnaru> ༼ つ ಥ_ಥ ༽つ wat༼ つ ಥ_ಥ ༽つ
[11:24] <Dechidechi> E-2 is Ryuusei 601
[11:24] <Dechidechi> Reppuu 601
Ryuusei 601
51cm proto
[11:24] <Segar> ༼ つ ಥ_ಥ ༽つSHIUN WHEN ༼ つ ಥ_ಥ ༽つ
[11:24] <Admiral Mikado> Reppuu Kai was Spring 2014 E-1
[11:25] <Dechidechi> ok nvm, I was smoking 
[11:25] <Dechidechi> 51cm is E-2
[11:25] <Dechidechi> with ryuusei 601
[11:25] <Segar> yep
[11:25] <Xenzul> never
[11:25] <Xenzul> I say
[11:25] <Xenzul> NEVER
[11:25] <Crazy teitoku> Nobody mentioned about hull mount torps :&gt;
[11:26] <Segar> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z5-P9v3F8w never say never? :&gt;(JB alert)
[11:27] <Crazy teitoku> I'd actually laugh if the devs later add some of those age old event equip drops as some LSC like equipment crafting option.
[11:27] <Segar> 0.1%
[11:27] <Segar> :.
[11:27] <Segar> :&gt;
[11:27] <Crazy teitoku> Age old as in those 2013 event drops.
[11:27] <Admiral Mikado> Hull mount torps were Fall 2013 E-3
[11:28] <Crazy teitoku> Yup
[11:29] <Admiral Mikado> So long ago... :&lt;
[11:29] <Crazy teitoku> Something once seen cannot be 'unseen' again :&gt;
[11:30] <Dechidechi> well those were the times of regenerating Boss Hp
[11:30] <Crazy teitoku> IBS
[11:30] <Segar> hopefully I dont have to see that happen
[11:30] <Dechidechi> and it's the night battle in nodes and finall battle goes from night battle to day battle
[11:31] <Dechidechi> it's like 5-3, except the boss battle start as night battle and you can continue to day battle
