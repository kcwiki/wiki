Welcome to Kancolle Wiki, and open-content and user-generated website dedicated to the ''Kantai Collection'' franchise by Kadokawa Corporation.

''Kantai Collection'' (艦隊これくしょん), also known as ''KanColle'' (艦これ), is an online browser game in which one assumes the role of an admiral, assembles a fleet of kanmusu ('ship girls' based on World War II-era ships and submarines), and battles against fleets of abyssal warships. In addition to the original web game, various media including multiple manga series, light novels, a tabletop role-playing game, and a television anime series have been released, and a spin-off PlayStation Vita game is scheduled for a November 2015 release.

Kancolle Wiki is a fork project of an earlier wiki project located on Wikia. Due to community support, it was decided to fork the project away from Wikia so that the community could gain greater control over the project, without the limitations that Wikia offers such as advertisements and stylesheet restrictions.
