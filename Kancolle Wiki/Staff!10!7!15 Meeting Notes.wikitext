==Minutes==

# Introduction, people coming in: 10 mins
#* We all know who we are [[User:Totaku|Totaku]]
# Pacific Saury Update: 40 minutes
#** Longer than usual update (In order to handle the update)
#* Collecting and processing fish
#** Similar to Hisimochi
#*** However, much easier to find, but you have to have fish hunting equips (possibly [[Searchlight]]s, [[Type 3 Sonar|Sonar]], [[Type 0 Recon Seaplane|Seaplane]]s, [[Type 3 Depth Charge|Depth Charges]], though the latter is illegal in Japan)
#*** There may be items for processing as well
#*** These turn into new items (e.g. Ikazuchi's fan)
#*** Need to make sure that we get new items
#*** Need to get info on: fishing spots (maps and nodes), fishing equips, fish required for items, and success rates (in case that is a thing); also, info on what we get from trading the items.
#** Likely going to be new quests
#*** Need to make sure we get past quest data down pat
#* [[Isokaze]] gets new graphics, is droppable (!!)
#** Possibly four other ships may also get autumn CGs
#** May also get new seasonal lines
#** We will need to get her drop locations
#** [[Tanikaze]] Needs something
#* UI Improvements
#** Likely changes: Equipment Library expansion: It's already near capacity
#** Also always be wary of the ability to scrap multiple shipgirls
#* Will likely try to make a page ahead of time to be prepared
# Fall 2015 Event
#* We should start thinking about event improvements now
#** It is our heaviest user period and a good time for growth
# Improving the wiki: 15 minutes
#* Gensui Hime has been working on takign down the useless ephemera from the wiki: Comment pages, unused images, files, etc.
#** Currently we are categorizing the unused images
#** If anyone knows of any mass-deleted images talk to Gensui Hime
#* The issue of Templates
#** Should we keep using legacy templates from Wikia or design our own?
#*** Usability a factor in consideration; event pages are an example of less-than-optimal usability.
#* Front Page Redesign is moving forward, thanks to Gensui Hime
#* Equipment lists for CVB for when Jet Planes get introduced, as they're CVB only, thanks to Totaku
#The Media Portal
# The return of non-lottery and future DMM server plans
#* Currently we have recovered from the lottery crisis
#* Lottery MAY be reimplimented in the future
#** Enterprise (on Himeuta) has gone missing
#** Still have Lianna
# Ongoing projects: 10 minutes
#* We are doing stuff with Himeuta
#* Telling Gensuihime to get a real job
#* Buy a house (Patches)
#* SSL may become a thing in the future depending upon the situation then
# Recruitment Drive: 10 Minutes
#* Oh Boy
#* Need someone to act as a leader
# Comments: 15 minutes
