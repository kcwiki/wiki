[12:01] <SerialConvort> I love how 5-3 is pretty much Sendais heaven

[12:03] <SerialConvort> Guten Morgen
[12:03] <SerialConvort> Good morn
[12:04] <WanWan101> 75 - 48 = ....
[12:04] <WanWan101> 27 levels =3=)
[12:06] <Dechidechi> that's not a good way to calculate levels
[12:06] <Admiral Mikado> ^
[12:06] <Dechidechi> it's like saying lv99-98 
1 more level
[12:06] <Flonnaru> 150-48 is 102
[12:07] <Dechidechi> but the exp for leveling that one level = leveling 50+ low level 
[12:09] <Sshinka> Pheeew! 50 transports done!
[12:09] <Dechidechi> hardcore
[12:09] <SerialConvort> Really hardcore
[12:09] <Dechidechi> i'm not done cause i'm studying
[12:09] <Dechidechi> tmr last final
[12:09] <Sshinka> seriously Bw1 and 50 transports kill whole day
[12:09] <Flonnaru> get your 50 kills done in 5-4
[12:09] <Dechidechi> ^
[12:09] <Admiral Mikado> Bw1 takes longer IMHO
[12:10] <Sshinka> depends on compass rly... both 1-1 and Orel
[12:10] <Dechidechi> bw1 basically = at least 24 boss runs 
[12:10] <Sshinka> yep
[12:11] <WWII44> hey
[12:11] <Dechidechi> 50 transport if ur lucky at 2-2, you can get it down in 13 runs
[12:11] <Admiral Mikado> I do the 50 transporter kills in 4-2 while trying to get 12 boss kills for the weekly quest
[12:11] <Sshinka> hey WW

[12:42] <Crazy teitoku> 陸奥 (lewd) http://tsundora.com/123167
[12:42] <Kitsuboshi> 4662 is taht a good sushi plan?
[12:42] <Dechidechi> i prefer 1000 more extra rsc
[12:42] <Kitsuboshi> i htought 3 was bad :x
[12:43] <Dechidechi> I'm kindof into believing the total rsc count thing, but there's not too much stat on that
[12:43] <Alexanderex> 'cause dechi's tricking him into rolling a jun'you out 
[12:43] <Alexanderex> kek
[12:43] <Crazy teitoku> @Jintsuu gonna craft sushi?
[12:43] <Kitsuboshi> gonna try again

[12:43] <Dechidechi> and I got my sushi with 4672, cause too much steel
[12:43] <Alexanderex> i haven't gotten a single CL with larger recipes before

[12:44] <Admiral Mikado> Me neither
[12:44] <Kitsuboshi> GIVE ME NOSHIRO
[12:44] <Kitsuboshi> i don't want no Kongou
[12:44] <Alexanderex> you jinxed your self brah
[12:44] <Dechidechi> yea, that's what the wikiwiki is trying to prove, like 20000 total rsc = 0 CL results
[12:44] <Admiral Mikado> Not really, I'm done with LSC
[12:44] <Crazy teitoku> inb4 segar's curse
[12:44] <Alexanderex> so it's possible to get CL with 4662, huh?
[12:44] <Qu33k> I posted this earlier, but for those who weren't here then, dogs &amp; booze for St Paddy's Day: https://40.media.tumblr.com/79ea35deb82971f6ddcde8176fcf39df/tumblr_nl9t30I7Sl1sywi7vo1_540.jpg

[12:45] <CreamX> nsfw
[12:45] <Dechidechi> so i suppose yes you can get CL with 4/6/6/2
[12:45] <Kitsuboshi> w/e yolo
[12:46] <Dechidechi> so far there are 0 reports of CL results on rsc over 20000 for LSC
[12:46] <Kitsuboshi> 4:30?
[12:46] <Qu33k> ffs, that's not nsfw
[12:46] <Kitsuboshi> isn't taht fusou
[12:46] <Qu33k> fully clothed
[12:46] <Dechidechi> 4:30 is akagi
[12:46] <Qu33k> &gt;.&lt;
[12:46] <Alexanderex> fusou's 4:20
[12:46] <Kitsuboshi> lame
[12:46] <Xenzul> well, i got noshiro in 5-4
[12:46] <Qu33k> silly concept, but still cute
[12:46] <Xenzul> well event first
[12:46] <Xenzul> but you can try 5-4
[12:46] <Kitsuboshi> so Mikado's plan got me kongou and dechi's got akagi :T
[12:47] <Admiral Mikado> I got Noshiro twice from Fall E-3
[12:47] <Xenzul> i got her from the original event :V
[12:47] <Dechidechi> my first noshiro is dated back to march 2014
[12:47] <Qu33k> someone on Tumblr mentioned 4772 as the Musashi plan
[12:47] <Qu33k> I got Kongou
[12:47] <Crazy teitoku> Agano and Noshiro sort of dropped like candies for me at that last event.
[12:47] <Kitsuboshi> ^
[12:47] <Qu33k> you and everyone else, CrazyTTK
[12:47] <Kitsuboshi> all i know is
[12:48] <Kitsuboshi> someone is gonna get a sushi/yamato today
[12:48] <Kitsuboshi> always happens after i fail :T
[12:48] <CreamX> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BjkdCrWCQAAHYkI.jpg:large lewd
[12:48] <Crazy teitoku> @Qu33k inb4 self declaration of milking all the luck and not getting one mochi :p 
[12:48] <Crazy teitoku> I got Yamato pretty much first try as well, crafted her during the event.
[12:49] <Alexanderex> lol kitsu
[12:49] <Alexanderex> quick, rig the system
[12:49] <Arkayda963> (nanodesu) 
[12:49] <Alexanderex> go to your alt account and LSC now
[12:49] <WanWan101> <span class="me-username">* <span>WanWan101</span></span> rolls arkay
[12:49] <Kitsuboshi> i don't have one D:
[12:49] <Kitsuboshi> ARK~
[12:49] <Kitsuboshi> <span class="me-username">* <span>Kitsuboshi</span></span> flop
[12:50] <Arkayda963> &gt;_&lt;
[12:50] <Kitsuboshi> I just failed 2x Yamato/sushi plans
[12:50] <Kitsuboshi> i'm out of KC for today YAY~
[12:50] <Admiral Mikado> So?
[12:50] <Kitsuboshi> hmm was just informing him :x
[12:50] <Arkayda963> lol
[12:50] <Crazy teitoku> I've stopped LSC for awhile now, going to continue not LSCing for maybe at least a month or so.
[12:50] <Dechidechi> well, you know if I were you and i have 0 LSC big ships, I would aim for Bismarck first
[12:51] <Admiral Mikado> ^
[12:51] <Dechidechi> cause you can get yamato and sushi from bismarck recipe too
[12:51] <Alexanderex> 4672, huh
[12:51] <Admiral Mikado> And you have control over whether Bismarck can appear or not
[12:51] <Kitsuboshi> um was that aimed at me?
[12:51] <CreamX> aimed for maruyu
[12:51] <Arkayda963> but 5hr can mean Nagato-class :s 
[12:51] <Dechidechi> if you don't have LSC big ships that is
[12:51] <Alexanderex> basic recepie kek
[12:51] <Reikyu> and a bonus chance for musashi
[12:52] <Alexanderex> lol
[12:52] <Alexanderex> arkay, better see a 5 hour timer than never
[12:52] <CreamX> use z1 fs
[12:52] <Arkayda963> well yeah xD
[12:52] <Kitsuboshi> i have Bismark, no interest in taihou, so going for yamasushi
[12:52] <Dechidechi> is ur bismarck drei yet?
[12:52] <Kitsuboshi> and married
[12:52] <Dechidechi> I got both yamato and sushi with bismarck drei tho
[12:53] <Arkayda963> i need Atago for finish my pre-quest for get Z1
[12:53] <Crazy teitoku> Some have also said that if you aim for sush's recipe, hotel appears.
[12:53] <Dechidechi> Yamato on Bismarck drei patch
[12:53] <Arkayda963> so need wait for biscuit :p 
[12:53] <Alexanderex> z1's a sham for me
[12:53] <Dechidechi> Sushi right after Yamashiro k2 patch
[12:53] <Admiral Mikado> Hotel &amp; Sushi share the same recipe :P 
[12:53] <Alexanderex> I've gotten better ships with prinz lel
[12:53] <Alexanderex> me and my poor z1 streak
[12:53] <Kitsuboshi> hmm
[12:53] <CreamX> waiting for eugen to be crafted on lsc
[12:53] <CreamX> :&gt;
[12:53] <Crazy teitoku> They do, except supposedly sushi's was something like 4/7/7/2 on wiki or something.
[12:53] <Kitsuboshi> kuro should have rolled after my fail
[12:53] <Kitsuboshi> maybe he could have gotten her
[12:53] <Admiral Mikado> That's just a variation of the same basic recipe
[12:54] <Admiral Mikado> The only real difference is that Musashi requires at least 20 (devmat)
[12:54] <Arkayda963> on wiki they say Sushi come when you put 20 dev mat than 1...
[12:54] <Admiral Mikado> Why is there no icon yet...? :&lt;
[12:54] <Crazy teitoku> shrug I got yamato with 20 devmat :) 
[12:54] <Admiral Mikado> So did I
[12:54] <Alexanderex> ^
[12:54] <Arkayda963> (lag) :p 
[12:54] <CreamX> (screw) 
[12:54] <Kitsuboshi> same reason we don't have (taiha)
[12:54] <Dechidechi> we have (de ) (chi ) <3 
[12:55] <Admiral Mikado> It's just that if you already have Musashi you can effectively remove her from the result pool by using only 1 dev mat
[12:55] <Alexanderex> where's the riot for it when we need one
[12:55] <CreamX> (batman) (screw) ing (nanodesu) 
[12:55] <Alexanderex> can bissie appear with 1 devmat?
[12:55] <Admiral Mikado> No
[12:55] <Crazy teitoku> Ah
[12:55] <CreamX> No~
[12:55] <Dechidechi> just 20 devmat them
[12:55] <Alexanderex> crap
[12:55] <Reikyu> i tried for musashi but got yamato, and now i'm stuck still using 20 dev mat attempts :x
[12:55] <Alexanderex> oh well, not like i'm gonna LSC for the next few months
[12:55] <Crazy teitoku> ^
[12:55] <Alexanderex> i'm already starting to prepare for hibernation
[12:56] <Reikyu> hibernation?
[12:56] <CreamX> lsc b4 the event stats :3
[12:56] <Arkayda963> as for me i can't do LSC anyway
[12:56] <Alexanderex> event
[12:56] <Reikyu> too soon
[12:56] <Crazy teitoku> It appears for me I have better luck at crafting during events.
[12:56] <Alexanderex> nevah too soon :3
[12:56] <CreamX> https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1530482?tags=zuikaku_%28kantai_collection%29
[12:56] <Arkayda963> 18k (fuel) / 15k (steel) / 4k (ammo / 5k (baux) 
[12:56] <Crazy teitoku> @Arkay even though you managed to get Nagato class :P 
[12:56] <Reikyu> too soon = no more milking regen
[12:56] <Alexanderex> event preparation is only for a limited time but i can LSC whenever
[12:56] <Arkayda963> i already have nagato class :p 
[12:57] <Arkayda963> Nagato my normal craft and Mutsu by drop
[12:57] <Crazy teitoku> That is what I meant lel, they also appear in LSC drops
[12:57] <Arkayda963> i know
[12:57] <Reikyu> every 4 days above softcap = 1 big ship lsc attempt
[12:57] <Alexanderex> oh, the heartache
[12:57] <Crazy teitoku> &lt; still missing mutslug
[12:57] <Alexanderex> I've gotten a nagato and a mutsu from LSC
[12:57] <Dechidechi> you can 1 big ship LSC per 1.5 day
[12:57] <Crazy teitoku> Nagato from normal crafting.
[12:57] <Alexanderex> imagine the heartstopping 5 hour timer
[12:57] <Alexanderex> and you see either of them
[12:57] <Dechidechi> it means an attempt for Sushi every 1.5 day
[12:58] <WanWan101> both nagato and mutsu from yamato recipe =3=
[12:58] <Kitsuboshi> that how it works~
[12:58] <Alexanderex> i can't farm 4662 within 1.5 days lol
[12:58] <Arkayda963> i can't get the ressource in 1.5 days Dechi =w=
[12:58] <Reikyu> 4 days of natural regen alone is a big ship lsc
[12:58] <Blasterion> My mutsuki crew is so cute
[12:58] <Reikyu> that takes 0 work
[12:58] <WanWan101> finally reaching the boss
[12:58] <Crazy teitoku> 1.5 days crafting sushi is like yolo style.
[12:59] <Crazy teitoku> Stuff that.
[12:59] <Dechidechi> why would you not play kancolle for 4 days tho
[12:59] <Reikyu> i'm saying if you go over softcap now, you're losing lscs
[12:59] <Crazy teitoku> inb4 desire detector
[12:59] <Blasterion> because 80 hour expedition is cancer
[12:59] <Kitsuboshi> i still played during that exp
[12:59] <Kitsuboshi> during event
[01:00] <Kitsuboshi> no biggy
[01:00] <Dechidechi> 80 hour is only 1 fleet down
[01:00] <Kitsuboshi> ^
[01:00] <Dechidechi> you always still have the first fleet to poke with
[01:00] <Sshinka> i'm without one fleet for 2 weeks now.. clearing all long expeditions
[01:00] <Sshinka> and i'm still ok with resources
[01:00] <Qu33k> Sshinka, we've all been there
[01:01] <Qu33k> no fun, but worth the results
[01:01] <Sshinka> yeah
[01:01] <Crazy teitoku> I plan to do that next month actually. Doing all the long expeditions on three fleets after I amassed enough res.
[01:01] <Kitsuboshi> idk i just elt like i really needed tokyo so i did everything for it
[01:01] <Blasterion> gotta do the 2 day SS one like 5 times or something
[01:01] <Blasterion> yeah
[01:01] <Blasterion> I figured it's not an event yet
[01:01] <Sshinka> you get enough res for daily needs from 2 expeditions + quests
[01:01] <Blasterion> I need tokyo
[01:02] <Kitsuboshi> hoenstly
[01:02] <Blasterion> Better Now than ever
[01:02] <Dechidechi> guess i should start wasting mah burners on maruyu LSC :&gt;
[01:02] <Kitsuboshi> tokyo&gt;z1
[01:02] <Dechidechi> 1450+ burners lel
[01:02] <Sshinka> hell didn't even have 4th expedition until HQ level 74
[01:02] <CreamX> 735 atm
[01:02] <Crazy teitoku> I like to be better prepared nonetheless, I have too many long exp not even attempted.
[01:02] <Sshinka> i mean 4th fleet
[01:03] <Crazy teitoku> Almost the same here.
[01:03] <CreamX> who?
[01:03] <Crazy teitoku> You meant 4th fleet?
[01:03] <CreamX> i unlock my 4th fleet at 65 . .
[01:03] <Sshinka> 74 here
[01:03] <Crazy teitoku> 73 or so.
[01:03] <Sshinka> funny how some ppl unlock it before lvl 40
[01:03] <Dechidechi> about this time 1 year ago, i crafted shimakaze 
[01:04] <Xenzul> crafted
[01:04] <Xenzul> pfffffffffffft
[01:04] <Xenzul> why not drop
[01:04] <Alexanderex> i crafted shimabutt quite early on too
[01:04] <Crazy teitoku> I also crafted shimabutt as well.
[01:04] <CreamX> shimabutt at lvl 10
[01:04] <Alexanderex> though I didn't find immediate use of her
[01:04] <Arkayda963> wait... 5 days natural genere = big LSC ? =w=
[01:04] <Dechidechi> cause shimakaze decided to come when I was about to enter my finals week last year
[01:04] <Dechidechi> it was sunday and i was stuyding, then shimakaze crafted
[01:04] <Sshinka> crafted her very early.. like lvl 10-12
[01:05] <Alexanderex> arkayda... 5 days natural regen without loss
[01:05] <Dechidechi> I was HQ 55? 
[01:05] <Alexanderex> that means 0 sorties, unless you supplement sortieswith expeds
[01:05] <WanWan101> i unlocked 4th fleet just before 40 :/ 
[01:05] <Crazy teitoku> I think I was around HQ 30 when I got shimabutt.
[01:05] <SerialConvort> I got shimakaze on like 2-3 or something
[01:05] <SerialConvort> When I was HQ 23 or 30
[01:05] <Crazy teitoku> er I meant got as in crafted.
[01:05] <Arkayda963> hum......... weird
[01:05] <Dechidechi> well I crafted all my buildable ships
[01:06] <Crazy teitoku> I was also hoping to get beaver but got shimabutt instead, wasn't complaining.
[01:06] <Alexanderex> .. sending DDs as 1-1 fodder is fucking suicidal for me
[01:06] <CreamX> http://imgur.com/8yxsGip dechi . . .celebrate for shimakaze
[01:06] <Dechidechi> I don't have anything to aim for :v

[01:07] <Alexanderex> hmm wouldn't no.2 be better?
[01:08] <Alexanderex> unless you improve no.3 to like 5 or stars
[01:08] <Dechidechi> I can get no.2 from modding factory
[01:08] <Xenzul> Did you know
[01:08] <Xenzul> Spending 5mins in K-chat
[01:08] <Reikyu> is cancerous to your health?
[01:08] <Xenzul> Will make you lose half your brain cells
[01:08] <Xenzul> Cancer
[01:08] <Xenzul> CANCER
[01:08] <Sshinka> Xen why are you so obsessed with Cancer today?
[01:08] <Dechidechi> I thought 5 mins in K-cht = lose half of ur sperm stock
[01:08] <Admiral Mikado> no.3 is better for CA(V)s since they don't really need the accuracy bonus of the no.2 guns, they have a 4th slot for radars.
[01:08] <Xenzul> Today?
[01:09] <Xenzul> Arent you sure its been like this for the last 4 days
[01:09] <Arkayda963> Xen are obsessed by Cancer since 2 day ago too =w=
[01:09] <Dechidechi> the only way to get cheap no.3 is from Mikuma kai
[01:09] <Sshinka> hmm didnt notice it before, let's say 15 hours
[01:09] <Dechidechi> and I have 10+ no.2
[01:09] <Xenzul> I wonder why?

[01:30] <Dechidechi> I clear 2-5s, second one doesn't want to come, makes me wonder if I should remodel the first one so the second taigei will cum
[01:30] <Crazy teitoku> I got two whales from E-1

[01:36] <Xenzul> I thought we went through this already

[01:45] <Dechidechi> dam it, my AP shell is 6 stars now
[01:46] <Dechidechi> I need moar AP shells :/ 
[01:48] <Kevadu> That's what I've been doing for nearly all my dailies since AP shells become upgradable...
[01:48] <Kevadu> The rate is not good
[01:48] <Dechidechi> i know
[01:48] <Kevadu> But I've gotten a few...
[01:48] <CreamX> http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=48782220
[01:48] <Marcorius> it's the 3th or 4th dechi?
[01:48] <Dechidechi> I've been alternating between obs seaplane and AP shell
[01:48] <Dechidechi> Trying to get my 3rd Type 1
[01:49] <Dechidechi> i'm only upgrading it now cause Akizuki doesn't upgrade T91 now
[01:49] <Dechidechi> going to get a 7th akizuki gun for akizuki to match her CG
[01:50] <Marcorius> Im going for my 3th two more stars :&gt; I spamed so hard the type 91 recipe 
[01:50] <Kevadu> I also want to at least +1 all my type 1s
[01:50] <Kevadu> Which eats a lot of AP shells
[01:51] <Dechidechi> now that i'm out of slots for extra maruyus, I'll just spam AP shells and Type 0s to stay under cap
[01:52] <Crazy teitoku> &gt; stay under cap
[01:52] <Crazy teitoku> soft cap?
[01:52] <Sshinka> it's waste of resources whenever you go over soft cap
[01:53] <Kevadu> It is but resources are cheap
[01:53] <Ninthsense> kev how many type 1 you have
[01:53] <Sshinka> i do it only prior to event. one or two weeks
[01:53] <Kevadu> I wouldn't really worry about it unless you're LSC'ing
[01:53] <Kevadu> Just the two, Ninth
[01:53] <Kevadu> But I'm pretty close to a third
[01:53] <Crazy teitoku> It isn't so much of a waste during events, people showing off 6 digit res figures.
[01:53] <Ninthsense> 3rd from akashi?
[01:53] <Sshinka> yeah, still got lots of LSCs to do...
[01:53] <Kevadu> Yes, how else would you get a third?
[01:55] <Sshinka> Crazy Tetoku - those people have all LSC ships they want, and most of their ships is levelled to where they should be..
[01:56] <Reikyu> only some of them
[01:56] <Qu33k> or are just hoarders by nature
[01:56] <Qu33k> o/
[01:56] <Crazy teitoku> ^
[01:56] <Reikyu> hoarding instead of investing makes things cost more!
[01:56] <Qu33k> but we have 6 figure resources for events
[01:57] <Kevadu> Well after I stopped LSC'ing (I do have everything) my resources just naturally went up a lot
[01:57] <Qu33k> and don't have to post single digit resource screen shots
[01:57] <Kevadu> Didn't even have to try to hit six digits, really
[01:57] <Qu33k> :-p 
[01:57] <Qu33k> same here, Kev, without LSC, resources pile up quick
[01:58] <Qu33k> esp with the drum expeditions
[01:58] <Sshinka> being over the soft cap gives you loss of 43'200 fuel, ammo and steel per month
[01:59] <CreamX> https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1938027?tags=akigumo_%28kantai_collection%29
[01:59] <Alexanderex> that's no loss
[01:59] <WanWan101> :3
[01:59] <Qu33k> right
[01:59] <Sshinka> ok potential income
[01:59] <Qu33k> better
[02:00] <Crazy teitoku> Also waiting patiently for the res to build up as well at that.
[02:00] <Alexanderex> i don't know if income is used there....
[02:00] <Alexanderex> "expeditions and weeklies" are more income than daily 1440
[02:01] <Kevadu> Sshinka, I agree if you're actively LSC'ing and the like, but you don't seem to be acknowledging that there really are a lot of people who's resource pile up because they don't have anything to spend them on
[02:01] <CreamX> https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1906343?tags=akigumo_%28kantai_collection%29
[02:01] <Sshinka> tbh i'll hit my soft cap only prior to event.. got stuff to craft before that
[02:01] <Kevadu> So potential lost income isn't a big deal
[02:01] <Alexanderex> yeah
[02:02] <Kevadu> And building up a stockpile for events isn't a bad things if you want to power clear them
[02:02] <Qu33k> ^
[02:02] <Qu33k> ^^
[02:02] <Qu33k> that's me
[02:02] <Alexanderex> this game's players are pretty much divided into "those who have everything" and "those who don't have everything, yet"
[02:02] <Qu33k> in a nutshell
[02:02] <Reikyu> unless your luck is capped on all your cut in ships, you don't have everything, yet :3
[02:02] <Crazy teitoku> More like hardcore players vs casual players, that and different strategies used.
[02:02] <Qu33k> I learned first Event just how fast resources can be burned
[02:03] <Qu33k> so I stock up
[02:03] <Qu33k> big time
[02:03] <Alexanderex> I can overstock, and afford to LSC during event
[02:03] <Kevadu> Yeah, E5 last event was pretty brutal on my resources
[02:03] <Alexanderex> sure ,crafting is important, but the only mandatory crafting i do is the daily 4 craftings
[02:03] <Qu33k> last event was brutal period
[02:03] <Kevadu> Combined fleet, Yamato-class, two support expeditions, low success rate...
[02:03] <Ninthsense> E5 was a bit costly cause i used all my good shipsand 2 support expeditions
[02:04] <Alexanderex> lel
[02:04] <Alexanderex> costly in terms of resources
[02:04] <Crazy teitoku> I'll never forget my moment at AL/MI.
[02:04] <Alexanderex> at least we get to use all our good ships lol
[02:04] <Qu33k> it ate buckets like nobodies biz as well
[02:04] <Alexanderex> imagine ship lock at e-3
[02:04] <Qu33k> just wasn't a good farming map
[02:04] <Kevadu> I had plenty of buckets, honestly
[02:04] <Qu33k> that didn't eat buckets
[02:05] <Kevadu> My resources dipped dangerously low, on the other hand (though I never hit bottom unlike some)
[02:05] <Kevadu> But at the rate they were dropping it wouldn't have taken that many more runs...
[02:05] <Ninthsense> did you sparkle yamato class at 1-1?
[02:06] <Qu33k> I really do need to graph out the last Event
[02:06] <Reikyu> do you need to ask?
[02:06] <Qu33k> it would be amusing
[02:06] <Kevadu> Of course!
[02:06] <Reikyu> kevadu all sparkle all ships
[02:06] <Alexanderex> 1-1 is the only place to sparkle effectively
[02:06] <Alexanderex> well, that and PvP
[02:06] <Qu33k> PVP sparkles don't last 
[02:07] <Ninthsense> dam only like 800 fuel ammo to sparkle them
[02:07] <Qu33k> and are of limited amount
[02:07] <Alexanderex> yeah
[02:07] <Alexanderex> unless it's those single ship fleet
[02:07] <Qu33k> right
[02:07] <Qu33k> <span class="me-username">* <span>Qu33k</span></span> loves those
[02:07] <Alexanderex> hope for those lvl 120+ single ship fleets lol
[02:07] <Alexanderex> <span class="me-username">* <span>Alexanderex</span></span> has 4 of them today
[02:07] <Qu33k> pair of waifu subs/DDs
[02:07] <Qu33k> best
[02:07] <Ninthsense> i usually pvp if i need to sparkle yamato
[02:07] <Alexanderex> free exp for my utility ships!
[02:08] <Alexanderex> it's hard to train katori, akitsu, akashi, taigei and 2 random ships at the same time
[02:08] <Alexanderex> without guzzling resources just for an S rank
[02:08] <Qu33k> no kidding
[02:08] <Alexanderex> my katori still not kai yet
[02:08] <Alexanderex> sad lyfe
[02:08] <Decyl> Do 1-2 at a time
[02:09] <Alexanderex> hmmphs
[02:09] <Decyl> No need to do them all at once
[02:09] <Alexanderex> i *can* train them at 3-2-A
[02:09] <Qu33k> you need to be disciplined, gently. . . 
[02:09] <Alexanderex> but i'm stockpiling for now so no sorties
[02:09] <Decyl> Katori's almost 80 now
[02:09] <Ninthsense> hmm training katori
[02:09] <Decyl> Taigei's... slowly getting there
[02:09] <Alexanderex> i don't really feel the need to rush any of the utilities ships out
[02:09] <Dechidechi> I kind of stopped feeding katori after she reached lv50
[02:09] <Reikyu> so much stockpiling, going for hard medal?
[02:09] <Alexanderex> i just want to get her to kai
[02:10] <Alexanderex> though i don't know why
[02:10] <Ninthsense> idk if its worth leveling katori i just put her in pvp when i can
[02:10] <Decyl> Akitsumaru I can't bring myself to level
[02:10] <Alexanderex> katori can be used in expeds
[02:10] <Qu33k> another twin 14cm, oc
[02:10] <Ninthsense> she doesnt count as CL though?
[02:10] <Reikyu> no, CT
[02:10] <Alexanderex> since she's supposedly the lowest cost CL
[02:10] <Alexanderex> cruiser*
[02:10] <Ninthsense> harder to use in expedition since she doesnt classify as anything useful
[02:10] <Alexanderex> oh well
[02:11] <Alexanderex> .... event routing again, perhaps
[02:11] <Kevadu> She's got 4 slots so you can make a decent ASW ship out of her
[02:11] <Qu33k> Decyl, Akitsu is worth leveling, she shows up as Event branching a lot
[02:11] <Alexanderex> jeezus, what were the devs smoking for last event
[02:11] <Dechidechi> well you do see a married akashi on Decyl
[02:11] <Ninthsense> yeah you could 4-3 her if you cared
[02:11] <Alexanderex> making katori a routing requirement
[02:11] <Reikyu> devs are S, players are M, we make a good match
[02:11] <Alexanderex> yin and yang
[02:11] <Decyl> My Akitsu is 44
[02:11] <Qu33k> Alex, Katori was sunk at Truk
[02:11] <Alexanderex> a good balance of salt producer and salt consumer
[02:12] <Decyl> That's was all Summer and Fall event leveling
[02:12] <Qu33k> her and Agano
[02:12] <Kevadu> Katori was sunk by Iowa
[02:12] <Reikyu> akashi being the exception
[02:12] <Decyl> But I don't like her enough to actively level her
[02:12] <Ninthsense> kev any predictions for choukai
[02:12] <Reikyu> or was she sunk there too
[02:12] <Kevadu> Which is so overkill it's kind of hilarious
[02:12] <Alexanderex> so sending ships to their supposed resting place is supposed to rewrite history of sorts
[02:12] <Alexanderex> lel
[02:12] <Kevadu> I predict Choukai k2 will be bad ass
[02:12] <Alexanderex> OP firepower
[02:12] <Sshinka> She will
[02:13] <Ninthsense> like nacht level?
[02:13] <Kevadu> Yeah, maybe the highest FP for a CA
[02:13] <Alexanderex> probably even higher than myoukou or haguro
[02:13] <Sshinka> FP + Lookouts - granted
[02:13] <Reikyu> one cruiser to rule them all?
[02:13] <Kevadu> But lower torp maybe...
[02:13] <Alexanderex> probably 75 kai ni too
[02:13] <Alexanderex> ^
[02:13] <Alexanderex> yeah
[02:13] <Alexanderex> lower torp
[02:13] <Alexanderex> probably
[02:13] <Alexanderex> more skewed towards day battle i guess
[02:14] <Sshinka> she is famous for NB tho :P 
[02:14] <Alexanderex> ... hence the lookout, perhaps?
[02:14] <Alexanderex> &gt;:D
[02:14] <Kitsuboshi> hmm twitch seems to be wonky right now, anyone else?
[02:14] <Alexanderex> low torps, make up for that with lookout
[02:14] <Alexanderex> dayum
[02:14] <Alexanderex> most CAs are balanced between day and night, guess choukai's about to break that
[02:14] <Sshinka> And her real life Lookouts are mentioned ALOT in texts
[02:14] <Sshinka> did awesome job
[02:15] <Reikyu> inb4 blueprint :&lt;
[02:15] <Alexanderex> LOL
[02:15] <Sshinka> probably
[02:15] <Alexanderex> BP for look out
[02:15] <Sshinka> coz of lookouts
[02:15] <Alexanderex> &gt; not sure if want
[02:15] <Ninthsense> hmm i hope she gets cute
[02:15] <Sshinka> yeah
[02:15] <Reikyu> 2 lookouts would be just right
[02:15] <Alexanderex> as of now I'm missing one BP for amagi or ryuuhou
[02:15] <Decyl> MOAR MIDRIFF
[02:16] <Alexanderex> i currently have.... 6 BPs
[02:16] <Alexanderex> hmmphs
[02:16] <Ninthsense> 6bp?
[02:16] <Kevadu> Well I really like Maya k2's art
[02:16] <Alexanderex> yeah
[02:16] <Alexanderex> i got nothing to use on LOL
[02:16] <Alexanderex> YamaFusou not 80 yet
[02:16] <Alexanderex> chikuma not K2 yet
[02:16] <Ninthsense> i like maya k2
[02:16] <Alexanderex> no Biscuit too
[02:16] <Reikyu> maya kai ni art so wonderful
[02:16] <Decyl> Maya's great
[02:16] <Segar> 80% on 50 trans
[02:16] <Decyl> I really like it
[02:16] <Ninthsense> i think furutaka was a bit underwhelming
[02:16] <Segar> 50% on world 2 daily
[02:16] <Alexanderex> maya K2 is like a freaking godsend
[02:17] <Segar> which will finish first
[02:17] <Ninthsense> but rest of them have been pretty good
[02:17] <Sshinka> I also expect next event to be full of NB nodes... lookouts montly reward... mochi lookouts, choukai + lookouts.... smells like Yasen to me
[02:17] <Decyl> Furutaka was bland to me
[02:17] <Alexanderex> finally a K2 art that everyone digs
[02:17] <Segar> :&lt;
[02:17] <Reikyu> and installations
[02:17] <Segar> what about Haguro
[02:17] <Alexanderex> yes
[02:17] <Reikyu> gotta use that sub thingamajig
[02:17] <Alexanderex> since her , too lol
[02:17] <Kevadu> Nachi and Ashigara were a bit disappointing after Haguro and Myoukou (which I *really* liked)
[02:17] <Decyl> Haguro is bob, bob is awesome
[02:17] <Kevadu> But it's not like they're bad
[02:17] <Alexanderex> it's been quite awhile since people don't complain about K2 arts
[02:17] <Alexanderex> yeah, but people just like to find faults lol
[02:18] <Alexanderex> like with Yamafusou K2 arts
[02:18] <Qu33k> yes
[02:18] <Qu33k> yes they do
[02:18] <Decyl> Patiently awaiting Shouhou kai2
[02:18] <Qu33k> :-) 
[02:18] <Qu33k> bring it
[02:18] <Ninthsense> ive gotten to like nacht
[02:18] <Alexanderex> honestly speaking, Yamafusou K2 is just OP
[02:18] <Qu33k> she's in the 90s
[02:18] <Ninthsense> ashigara is w/e
[02:18] <Reikyu> next event will have the return of AL-2 and those wg42s will save the day
[02:18] <Alexanderex> ...
[02:19] <Sshinka> i would still like little bit more armor on YamaFusou K2
[02:19] <Alexanderex> wg42
[02:19] <Alexanderex> yasen
[02:19] <Alexanderex> gee gee
[02:19] <Ninthsense> fusou was dinosauring
[02:19] <Alexanderex> launching potatoes at night sounds like a good idea kek
[02:19] <Ninthsense> t rex needs no armor
[02:19] <Alexanderex> T-rexing you mean
[02:19] <Alexanderex> lel
[02:19] <Reikyu> it's been a while since we had installation event bosses
[02:19] <Reikyu> Hoppo Mk2
[02:20] <Alexanderex> god please no
[02:20] <Alexanderex> actually
[02:20] <Alexanderex> I've never encountered an installation before
[02:20] <Alexanderex> save for 3-5's hoppo
[02:20] <Reikyu> you missed AL/MI?
[02:20] <Alexanderex> yea
[02:20] <Decyl> O boy
[02:20] <Alexanderex> i joined on 24 august
[02:20] <Alexanderex> that's like
[02:20] <Decyl> You missed suffering
[02:20] <Alexanderex> 2 days to the end of AL/MI
[02:20] <Decyl> And tears
[02:21] <Reikyu> had 2 of those suckers, daytime chip chip chip 
[02:21] <Crazy teitoku> ^
[02:21] <Alexanderex> chipping is okay if it drops hp bar
[02:21] <Alexanderex> just mentally exhaustive 
[02:21] <Crazy teitoku> I hit rock bottom on res at AL/MI, learnt my lesson and started hoarding my res like hell.
[02:22] <Hossinator> http://imgur.com/gallery/jm1F4MX
[02:22] <Alexanderex> i think AL/MI is an exception though
[02:22] <Reikyu> you had to, one of the bosses had 600 hp
[02:22] <Alexanderex> your resource count pretty much relies on RNG too
[02:22] <Reikyu> super big chips
[02:22] <SerialConvort> http://danbooru.donmai.us/pools/9705 Really cute comic
[02:22] <Alexanderex> the boss was accompanied by?
[02:22] <Reikyu> small junk
[02:22] <SerialConvort> Please do not abuse Naka chan da yo.
[02:22] <Alexanderex> hmmphs
[02:22] <Kevadu> What do you suppose the odds are that the next event will be something light?
[02:22] <Alexanderex> it actually sounds loads better than last event
[02:23] <Alexanderex> 3 himes
[02:23] <Crazy teitoku> I think people with like 6 digit res figures probably would have stood better chance at AL/MI compared to what I had.
[02:23] <Kevadu> Another crossover or something...
[02:23] <Reikyu> i think it's higher than normal
[02:23] <Alexanderex> total 1.3k hp
[02:23] <Reikyu> 2 year annivesary, a while since a small event
[02:23] <Alexanderex> i mean the prospect of facing 1 installation versus 3 himes lol
[02:23] <Crazy teitoku> They talk about spending like 60k or so per 2 maps at AL/MI
[02:23] <Kevadu> There's also only so many big battles left to base events on
[02:23] <Crazy teitoku> Er no, 60k per 3 or so maps.
[02:23] <Alexanderex> of course I guess final map isn't just about boss
[02:23] <Kevadu> But I guess they could do a string of minor ones
[02:23] <Alexanderex> the pre-boss nodes must've been hell, too
[02:23] <Reikyu> throw us a special bonus event
[02:24] <Reikyu> like arpeggio
[02:24] <Crazy teitoku> &gt; arpeggio
[02:24] <Alexanderex> just the prospect of facing a 600hp installation isn't that daunting
[02:24] <Crazy teitoku> not gonna happen again.
[02:24] <Alexanderex> wait season 2
[02:24] <Alexanderex> kek
[02:24] <Kevadu> Arpeggio event was fun
[02:24] <SerialConvort> Need
[02:24] <SerialConvort> Arpeggio
[02:24] <SerialConvort> Will
[02:24] <Kevadu> I would like something in that vain
[02:24] <SerialConvort> Kill
[02:24] <SerialConvort> For
[02:24] <Alexanderex> i wan see european fleet of fog~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[02:24] <SerialConvort> Arpeggio
[02:24] <Kevadu> It doesn't have to be Arpeggio itself
[02:24] <Ninthsense> would be fun but dont think its happening
[02:24] <Alexanderex> wait for another ship-turns-girl animu
[02:24] <Kevadu> Just an event that's more about fun than suffering...
[02:25] <Crazy teitoku> ^ what Ninth said
[02:25] <Crazy teitoku> It was probably to counteract the event before that, which was also insane.
[02:25] <Crazy teitoku> boss gauge regen.
[02:25] <Alexanderex> lolwhut.
[02:25] <Alexanderex> how bad was the regen
[02:25] <Alonne> hell on earth?
[02:26] <Decyl> O hey... 50 transport done
[02:26] <Decyl> Yay
[02:26] <Crazy teitoku> Enough to piss low level ttk off.
[02:26] <Sshinka> GZ
[02:26] <Kevadu> Everything pisses off low level teitoku. Ironbottom pissed off everyone
[02:26] <Alexanderex> like what, 1/4 bar a day regen?
[02:26] <Sshinka> that and Bw1 drained me of life force today
[02:26] <SerialConvort> AL/MI Pissed me off greatly
[02:26] <SerialConvort> Actually more like made me cry
[02:27] <Crazy teitoku> Anyway, since that last AL/MI event which I must dare say was just as full of salt the devs hasn't offered any fun event other than an easy event that I missed out.
[02:27] <Alexanderex> ... fall event?
[02:27] <Kevadu> Fall was cake
[02:27] <Reikyu> last event was very newbie friendly
[02:27] <Crazy teitoku> The one with akiduki and Eugen
[02:27] <Alexanderex> ^fall event, yeah
[02:27] <Crazy teitoku> Last event E-1 was newb friendly.
[02:27] <SerialConvort> &gt; Last Event Was Friendly
[02:27] <Kevadu> And AL/MI was *not* "just full of salt"
[02:27] <Alonne> then becomes hell
[02:28] <SerialConvort> &gt; I wasted all my 40k resources
[02:28] <SerialConvort> &gt; Wasted 150 bukkits
[02:28] <Kevadu> E6 was challenging but for the most part I quite enjoyed AL/MI. A lot of interesting new mechanics and stuff
[02:28] <SerialConvort> &gt; Only Cleared E-3
[02:28] <Alexanderex> bth it was newbie friendly
[02:28] <SerialConvort> What am I doing
[02:28] <Alexanderex> not farm-friendly
[02:28] <Reikyu> newbie friendly, average level not so friendly, high level farmer not friendly
[02:28] <Crazy teitoku> I couldn't imagine AL/MI being all that interesting, all that ship locking.
[02:29] <Alexanderex> ^
[02:29] <Alexanderex> &gt; interesting
[02:29] <Decyl> It was interesting... to hear all the stories
[02:29] <Alexanderex> /cues Masochism 
[02:29] <Kevadu> Ship locking made it more interessting
[02:29] <Alonne> anything is not friendly there you go
[02:29] <Kevadu> Actually having to plan where to use your ships
[02:29] <Crazy teitoku> ^ more signs of maso
[02:29] <Decyl> And creativeness TTK had to go through in later maps
[02:29] <Kevadu> Instead of just throwing your top ships at everything
[02:29] <Sshinka> E4 was the cheapest and super rewarding for me.. 4 clean runs with fleet without carriers. Unryuu and Nagamon from those 4 runs
[02:29] <Reikyu> where's the hitler video talking about e-6
[02:29] <Alexanderex> i made that mistake in fall
[02:29] <Crazy teitoku> So…maybe the next event we shall see a combination of both ship locking and boss gauge regen?
[02:30] <Kevadu> Unlikely
[02:30] <Decyl> I want more ship locking, planning was fun
[02:30] <Alexanderex> used Nagatos and KTKM/ooi in e1/2
[02:30] <Crazy teitoku> maybe that would please the maso fans?
[02:30] <Kevadu> I don't think they're going to bring back regen
[02:30] <Alexanderex> can't use them in e-3
[02:30] <Qu33k> ggggggggggRAH!
[02:30] <Hossinator> ship lock on hard
[02:30] <Alexanderex> oh, they will
[02:30] <Crazy teitoku> Never know how sad devs can get.
[02:30] <Alexanderex> they will bring back regen
[02:30] <Qu33k> can NOT find bosses this evening
[02:30] <Crazy teitoku> ^
[02:30] <Alexanderex> on those small event
[02:30] <Reikyu> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvjn0h4XZA4
[02:30] <Crazy teitoku> and then ship locks.
[02:30] <Sshinka> lol Qu33
[02:30] <Qu33k> switched to 2-2, went to transport node
[02:30] <Kevadu> I don't think you guys understand
[02:30] <Alexanderex> they purposely made the event small so the regenerating bar will have bigger impact
[02:30] <Marcorius> ah that video Reikyu :&gt;
[02:31] <Kevadu> You can complain about recent events but Ironbottom was on a whole different level of suffering
[02:31] <EchoHolic> ^
[02:31] <SerialConvort> I wasnt there
[02:31] <SerialConvort> Only for salty AL/MI
[02:31] <Alonne> same
[02:31] <Crazy teitoku> Saying AL/MI wasn't hard is just bs for new ttk
[02:31] <SerialConvort> Salty salty AL/MI
[02:31] <EchoHolic> Ironbottom is like E5/E6 but that you have to finish it within a single day or you'll have to start all over again
[02:32] <Reikyu> AL/MI was my first event, and it was wonderful! except i didn't do e6
[02:32] <EchoHolic> Nobody wants that
[02:32] <Alexanderex> sounds harsh
[02:32] <Dechidechi> one hour one bar
[02:32] <Alexanderex> sounds like a whole load of NOPE to me
[02:32] <Dechidechi> four hour a full boss hp
[02:32] <Reikyu> i went from 2 CV to 5 CV because of MI
[02:32] <EchoHolic> Wasn't it 2.7% per hour
[02:32] <Dechidechi> idk
[02:32] <Alexanderex> ok, i really hope they don't bring regenerating bars back
[02:32] <EchoHolic> It was nuts
[02:33] <Dechidechi> basically (bucket) dump
[02:33] <SerialConvort> Regen bars
[02:33] <Dechidechi> the reward is a sushi tho
[02:33] <Alexanderex> ....
[02:33] <SerialConvort> Sounds like I should hold my Bukkits dear and hug them
[02:33] <Dechidechi> your (bucket) vs sushi
[02:33] <EchoHolic> That was the only event where admirals sank ships enmasse to get Sushi
[02:33] <Alexanderex> imagine all the sushi drops now
[02:33] <Alonne> Regen Bars= pain on (bucket) 
[02:33] <EchoHolic> Truly ironbottomed
[02:33] <Alexanderex> &gt; sinking ships to get sushi
[02:34] <Dechidechi> if the next foreign BB in spring is the last map, it will be regen bar?
[02:34] <Blasterion> I thought ttks sank plenty of ships on the Arpeggio event
[02:34] <Alexanderex> maaan if i got my sushi that way, she wouldn't be happy about it
[02:34] <Blasterion> Regen bar is cancer
[02:34] <EchoHolic> Arpeggio was dirt easy iirc
[02:34] <EchoHolic> I didn't try it
[02:34] <Blasterion> idk I wasn't here
[02:34] <Crazy teitoku> I still maintain AL/MI was pretty torturous for new ttk. All those ship locks and compass trolling.
[02:34] <Dechidechi> I'm so glad they didn't make bismarck an event reward
[02:34] <EchoHolic> But it was the first event without regen
[02:34] <EchoHolic> And you had 70hp sub
[02:34] <Alexanderex> lolwhut
[02:34] <Blasterion> with Kleins shield
[02:34] <Alexanderex> 70hp
[02:34] <Dechidechi> if Bismarck became 2014 spring E-5, prob boss bar regen
[02:35] <Blasterion> nono no
[02:35] <Blasterion> not 70 hp
[02:35] <Reikyu> like 3 maps with easy branching and op ships 
[02:35] <Blasterion> 70 hp with KLEINS FIELD
[02:35] <Crazy teitoku> Iona was also classed as a fast SS as well.
[02:35] <Blasterion> big difference
[02:35] <Reikyu> that put lsc ships to shame with reload and repair costs
[02:35] <Crazy teitoku> You could basically run world 2 with just Iona or something.
[02:35] <Dechidechi> well you do have enough fuel power to push a yamato class, and Iona &lt; in size
[02:35] <Blasterion> too bad OP ships weren't here to stay =/
[02:36] <Crazy teitoku> ^
[02:36] <Crazy teitoku> Never intended to be.
[02:36] <Crazy teitoku> Devs just like to make us go all salty.
[02:36] <SerialConvort> Ikr
[02:36] <SerialConvort> But atleast you got to use em
[02:36] <Blasterion> yep
[02:36] <Dechidechi> no pls, if OP ships stayed, Imagine winter 2015 the boss would also have kleins field
[02:36] <Alexanderex> no.jpg
[02:36] <Dechidechi> remember the Devs gives you something good, but also something good to abyssals
[02:36] <Reikyu> i thought kleins was the evasion animation?
[02:37] <Crazy teitoku> They've given plenty more good stuff to abyssals than us.
[02:37] <Crazy teitoku> 400HP BB water demon.
[02:37] <Alexanderex> final abyssal boss Arpeggio Yamato
[02:37] <Qu33k> final Abyssal Boss, Neuroi Yamato
[02:37] <Crazy teitoku> …and if you went maso mode you have those two dysons
[02:38] <Reikyu> can i get an installation 'ship' that can only be damaged by sanshikis?
[02:38] <Alexanderex> zero fucks given to your NB cut-in
[02:38] <Qu33k> final form with Fuso shield. . . .
[02:38] <Dechidechi> and that dyson was in IBS
[02:38] <EchoHolic> Its not the HP that made us suffer
[02:38] <Dechidechi> you have to kill dyson to get sushi
[02:38] <EchoHolic> It's the armor
[02:38] <Alexanderex> 200 armour kek
[02:38] <Alexanderex> what are the devs smoking
[02:38] <Dechidechi> and during IBS there was no AP shell buff
[02:39] <Decyl> Salt, devs were smoking all that salt
[02:39] <Blasterion> It would be fucked up if the final abyssal boss is Enola Gay
[02:39] <Blasterion> but then again Enola Gay isn't a ship
[02:39] <Segar> inb4 catnuked
[02:39] <Blasterion> lol
[02:39] <Crazy teitoku> Wasn't that IBS event that also gave you those hull mount torps?
[02:39] <Hossinator> <span class="me-username">* <span>Hossinator</span></span> Enola Gays blast
[02:39] <Kevadu> Actually E-4 of IBS was the really hard map (which is not to say E-5 wasn't hard)
[02:40] <Blasterion> =(
[02:40] <Blasterion> I got Enola Gay'ed
[02:40] <Hossinator> hehe
[02:40] <Kevadu> But all night battles plus random compass BS plus regen plus bizarre requirements to get a second round at the boss...
[02:40] <Dechidechi> and no many K2 ships
[02:40] <Dechidechi> not 
[02:40] <Kevadu> That's the map where people started using suicide escorts
[02:40] <Blasterion> You know what would suck?
[02:40] <Blasterion> Another fleet lock
[02:41] <Dechidechi> there was only Poi k2 and kinugasa k2 and kongou k2 during that time
[02:41] <Dechidechi> and shigu
[02:41] <Hossinator> Fleet lock + random branching + regen
[02:41] <Blasterion> Combined Fleet
[02:41] <Sshinka> :( 
[02:41] <Blasterion> DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH SHIPS KING OF HEROES?
[02:41] <Xol2000> wasn't IBS the event that also has night battle -&gt; day battle mechanics?
[02:42] <Dechidechi> ^
[02:42] <Dechidechi> yes
[02:42] <Blasterion> lol
[02:42] <Crazy teitoku> Fleet lock + random branching + regen + difficult enemies at dead end nodes and being sent to dead end nodes most of the time.
[02:42] <Dechidechi> get killed at night then continue to day
[02:42] <Kevadu> Yeah Xol
[02:42] <Alexanderex> 1 map
[02:42] <Blasterion> lol
[02:42] <Kevadu> Except to get the day battle you had to not kill (!) certain ships
[02:42] <Alexanderex> 4 dead ends, 1 boss
[02:42] <Kevadu> Because you totally had control over that
[02:42] <Sshinka> I hope one one of the Devs is not reading all this....... It's all i hope for concerning next Event......
[02:42] <Kevadu> If you killed certain escort ships you didn't even get a day battle round
[02:42] <Dechidechi> we're not the first @sshinka
[02:42] <Crazy teitoku> I am sure devs has plenty of other ways to torture us.
[02:43] <Dechidechi> it has been discussed every since after 2013 fafl
[02:43] <Reikyu> good thing we don't have a chat log pasted all over the internet
[02:43] <Crazy teitoku> fleet lock + equip lock.
[02:43] <Reikyu> they might see what goes on here
[02:43] <Alexanderex> <span class="me-username">* <span>Alexanderex</span></span> sneaks chatlog to kancolle devs
[02:43] <WanWan101> abyssal support fleet.
[02:43] <Reikyu> OH HEY CHATLOG
[02:43] <Dechidechi> <span class="me-username">* <span>Dechidechi</span></span> flops on Alex
[02:43] <Blasterion> lol
[02:43] <Alexanderex> <span class="me-username">* <span>Alexanderex</span></span> flops with chatlogs
[02:44] <Sshinka> haha
[02:44] <Blasterion> <span class="me-username">* <span>Blasterion</span></span> Enola Gays Alex
[02:44] <Alexanderex> "must... give... to devs!"
[02:44] <Crazy teitoku> You make it sound like devs ran out of ideas to make us go salty :p how sad.
[02:44] <Alexanderex> all the salts!
[02:44] <Alexanderex> or rather, motivation
[02:44] <Crazy teitoku> They'll never run out of ideas to make us salty.
[02:44] <Alexanderex> or excuses to bring the pain
[02:44] <Blasterion> dude I am basically made of salt
[02:44] <Alexanderex> AL/MI round 2
[02:45] <Crazy teitoku> Ooyodo
[02:45] <Alexanderex> Oh!yodo

[02:51] <Dechidechi> https://twitter.com/oldspear/status/569016193849253888

[03:19] <Arkayda963> i gathering ressource on Kancolle
[03:19] <TScript> Needs Unity Web Player
[03:19] <RabidRage> doing exped 2,3,6 and running 2-3 for dailies

[03:19] <TScript> <span class="me-username">* <span>TScript</span></span> laughs
[03:19] <SerialConvort> I use 2, 3, and 5
[03:19] <Dechidechi> why do 3?
[03:20] <Segar> 2 21 tokyo1 right now
[03:20] <RabidRage> steel
[03:20] <Dechidechi> ur trading more fuel for the same amount of (steel) 
[03:20] <Arkayda963> http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/458867Capture.png 
[03:20] <SerialConvort> If you use the bare mininum you gain like 15 fuel and otherwise
[03:20] <RabidRage> well
[03:20] <Arkayda963> see ? my ressource are still low
[03:20] <Segar> actually 21 cut off some fuel cost for tokyo1
[03:20] <Segar> so thats pretty good
[03:20] <RabidRage> i have fuel surplus
[03:20] <SerialConvort> I use like two unkai DD and one CL for Exp 3
[03:20] <Segar> WHY WOULD YOU RUN 3 WHEN YOU HAVE TOKYOS
[03:20] <SerialConvort> I get more fuel than Im using
[03:20] <Dechidechi> the other thing people need to think about is fuel and ammo lost per rsc gained
