[08:36] <Harunadesu> :&lt;
[08:37] <Fujihita> get it run on DJ's server 
[08:37] <Fujihita> should be able to get it running 24/7
[08:37] <Gensui Hime> its not that
[08:37] <Gensui Hime> the javascript crashes and hangs
[08:37] <Harunadesu> what does it do
[08:37] <Gensui Hime> I already contacted sactage
[08:37] <Fujihita> it logs chat
[08:37] <Harunadesu> ic :&gt;
[08:38] <Gensui Hime> I'm gonna run it and debug it
[08:38] <Fujihita> I think it's missing something in the middle of the log yesterday
[08:38] <Kitsuboshi> k
[08:38] <Kitsuboshi> more guinea pigging
[08:39] <Fujihita> it went off for 2h yesterday
[08:39] <Gensui Hime> the constant hangings do that
[08:39] <Gensui Hime> I had it run for quite a bit
[08:39] <Harunadesu> like when chat crash?
[08:39] <Gensui Hime> but I can't pinpoint why it dies
[08:39] <Kitsuboshi> not like that
[08:39] <Kitsuboshi> seems to just die when it wants to
[08:40] <Harunadesu> bots need freedom :&gt;
[08:40] <Fujihita> it's like running an alpha release bot on a beta release chat
[08:40] <Fujihita> to begin with, this chat isn't exactly stable
[08:40] <Gensui Hime> quite so
[08:41] <Gensui Hime> but runescape has it running perfectly
[08:41] <Gensui Hime> WHY CANT PEOPLE USE IRC
[08:41] <Fujihita> well, they should be running beta release bot on a beta release chat
[08:41] <Fujihita> definitely better
[08:41] <Gensui Hime> rip
[08:41] <Gensui Hime> its been there for a while
[08:41] <Gensui Hime> 2 yearish
[08:42] <Fujihita> development for chat seems to have ceased
[08:42] <Xol2000> i use IRC :v
[08:42] <Xol2000> for twitch
[08:42] <Veeliam> come pleh WoonRO ragnarok

[08:42] <CreamX> cool
[08:42] <Gensui Hime> I'm gonna see if I can procure an IRC server
[08:43] <Kitsuboshi> are we gonna swap to IRC?
[08:43] <Gensui Hime> it is greatly desired
[08:43] <Gensui Hime> I can just implement some ajax scriptbots and that'd be the end 
[08:44] <Gensui Hime> but this javascript fuckery
[08:44] <Gensui Hime> makin me pissed
[08:44] <Fujihita> get an expert on it
[08:44] <Fujihita> get DJ
[08:44] <Fujihita> anyways, Ima gonna have lunch now
[08:44] <Kevadu> Well new people are going to be less likely to join an IRC channel...that might be a good thing depending on your point of view

[09:15] <Gensui Hime> but it keeps dying
[09:15] <Gensui Hime> are you any good with javascript
[09:15] <Dragonjet> only officially run it once it has been flagged as bot
[09:15] <Gensui Hime> I already contacted sactage about that
[09:15] <Gensui Hime> hopefully he returns my message within 2 weeks
[09:17] <Dragonjet> supposedly it should be hidden from [[Special:RecentChanges]]
[09:17] <Dragonjet> but before being flagged dont leave it running xD
[09:17] <Gensui Hime> can't you mess with CSS to hide it anyways
[09:18] <Gensui Hime> hell, I succeeded in hiding it here
[09:18] <Dragonjet> no it had a backend flag, see filter at the top
[09:18] <Dragonjet> it has hide/show bots
[09:18] <Dragonjet> not recommended to hack it
